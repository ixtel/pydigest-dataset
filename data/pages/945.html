        always been intriguing that web applications have so much code in 
        template files.  Coverage.py measures Python execution, so the logic
        in the template files goes un-measured.</p><p>(Of course, in a web application, there's even more Javascript code,
        which coverage.py also can't help with, but there are other tools that
        measure Javascript coverage.)</p><p>Recently I started experimenting with measuring templates as well as
        pure Python code.  Mako templates compile to Python files, which are
        then executed.  Coverage.py can see the execution in the compiled
        Python files, so once we have a way to back-map the lines from the Mako
        output back to the Mako template, we have the start of a usable Mako
        coverage measurement.</p><p>This Mako experiment is on the tip of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy">coverage.py repo</a>,
        and requires some code on the tip of Mako.  The code isn't right yet,
        but it shows the idea.  Eventually, this should be a plugin to coverage.py
        provided by Mako, but for now, we're just trying to prove out the concept.</p><p>If you want to try the Mako coverage (please do!), configure Mako to put
        your compiled .py files someplace convenient (like a mako/ directory in
        your project), then set this environment variable:</p><blockquote class="code"><code>$Â exportÂ COVERAGE_MAKO_PATH=/mako/<br/></code></blockquote><p>Jinja also compiles templates to Python files, but Django does not.
        Django is very popular, so I would like to support those templates also.
        Dmitry Trofimov wrote <a href="https://github.com/traff/dtcov">dtcov</a>
        to measure Django template coverage.  He does a tricky thing: in the
        trace function, determine if you are inside the Django template engine,
        and if so, walk the stack and look at the locals to grab line numbers.</p><p>As written dtcov looks too compute-intensive to run on full-sized
        projects, but I think the idea could work.  I'm planning to experiment
        with it this week.</p></div></div></body></html>
