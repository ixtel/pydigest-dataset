                      Let's start with a real-life example from our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/robotframework/webdemo" target="_blank">web demo project</a>. Here we have a test suite with one test case which tests that login is valid. As you can see, test data syntax is based on <span class="italic">keywords</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Keywords are composable, meaning you can define new keywords that use pre-existing keywords. This way, you can abstract details of testing to something that makes immediate sense; for example, we don't need to know what exactly the step <span class="teletype">Submit Credentials</span> actually does, unless we want to. Test cases are therefore clear and readable, with just the right level of abstraction to convey the <span class="italic">intent</span> of the test, rather than the nuts and bolts.
