<p>One month ago, I got an email from a colleague:</p>
<p>The subject of his email was a single word: PyData</p>
<p>The email had a single EventBrite.com URL.</p>
<p>Intrigued, I clicked… and that’s when my adventure into <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/" title="PyData Seattle 2015" target="_blank">PyData</a> began.</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to take you through 3 of the tutorials at PyData Seattle 2015: <a title="Simplified statistics through simulation" href="http://rayli.net/blog/data/pydata-seattle-2015-simulation-pyspark-and-deep-learning-tutorials/#Simplified_statistics_through_simulation">Simulation</a>, <a title="A brief introduction to Distributed Computing with PySpark" href="http://rayli.net/blog/data/pydata-seattle-2015-simulation-pyspark-and-deep-learning-tutorials/#A_brief_introduction_to_Distributed_Computing_with_PySpark">PySpark</a> and <a title="Learn to Build an App to Find Similar Images using Deep Learning" href="http://rayli.net/blog/data/pydata-seattle-2015-simulation-pyspark-and-deep-learning-tutorials/#Learn_to_Build_an_App_to_Find_Similar_Images_using_Deep_Learning">Deep Learning</a>.</p>

<h2><span id="Keynote_on_Friday_Jul-24">Keynote on Friday (Jul-24)</span></h2>
<p><strong>One-sentence summary?</strong> An interesting 1-hour plug for <a href="https://code.org/" title="Anybody can learn | Code.org" target="_blank">code.org</a>, but oddly no mention of Python or much about data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the speaker?</strong> <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/speaker/profile/93/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Hadi Partovi" target="_blank">Hadi Partovi</a> gave the <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/61/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Presentation: Keynote: Computer Science: America's Untapped Opportunity" target="_blank">keynote</a> on Friday. Slick presentation and a great message.</p>
<p><strong>What was the key message?</strong> The key message for me was the <a href="http://hourofcode.org" title="Hour of Code" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a>. Students (or in some cases entire schools) commit to a one-hour coding event to expose themselves to the awesome world of computing.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find out more?</strong> The <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/61/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Presentation: Keynote: Computer Science: America's Untapped Opportunity" target="_blank">keynote summary</a>, <a href="http://code.org" title="Anybody can learn | Code.org" target="_blank">code.org</a> and the <a href="http://hourofcode.org" title="Hour of Code" target="_blank">Hour of Code website</a> are all great resources to learn more about this initiative.</p>
<h2><span id="Simplified_statistics_through_simulation">Simplified statistics through simulation</span></h2>
<p><strong>One-sentence summary?</strong> Use Python’s <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" title="NumPy" target="_blank">NumPy</a> and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/" title="SciPy.org" target="_blank">SciPy</a> to do simulation in order to get a better understanding of statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the speaker?</strong> <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/speaker/profile/44/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Justin Bozonier" target="_blank">Justin Bozonier</a> gave <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/6/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Presentation: Simplified statistics through simulation" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. Great speaker and actively engaged with the audience without forcing the audience to participate (personally, I don’t  like forced participation).</p>
<p><strong>What was the key message?</strong> If you’d like to explore some statistics or probability theory, simulate it using Python so you can see the concepts come to life.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find out more?</strong> All the tutorial material is uploaded to <a href="https://github.com/jcbozonier/PyData2015/" title="jcbozonier/PyData2015 · GitHub" target="_blank">Justin’s github PyData2015 folder</a>.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://github.com/jcbozonier/PyData2015/blob/master/PyData%20Workshop.ipynb" title="PyData2015/PyData Workshop.ipynb at master · jcbozonier/PyData2015 · GitHub" target="_blank">PyData2015 IPython Notebook</a> is a great way to experiment with the tutorial.</p>
<p>It covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monte Carlo Simulation</li>
<li>Bootstrapping</li>
<li>Simulating a function</li>
<li>Simulating split tests</li>
<li>Simulating a probability puzzle</li>
<li>…and a few bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="A_brief_introduction_to_Distributed_Computing_with_PySpark">A brief introduction to Distributed Computing with PySpark</span></h2>
<p><strong>One-sentence summary?</strong> A great hands-on intro to <a href="http://spark.apache.org/" title="Apache Spark™ - Lightning-Fast Cluster Computing" target="_blank">Spark</a> and <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/" title="Welcome to Spark Python API Docs! — PySpark documentation" target="_blank">PySpark</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the speaker?</strong> <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/speaker/profile/30/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Holden Karau" target="_blank">Holden Karau</a> gave this <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/84/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Presentation: A brief introduction to Distributed Computing with PySpark" target="_blank">hands-on tutorial</a>. I found her to be an engaging and knowledgeable speaker! She explained concepts in understandable language (especially for those new to Spark, like me!).</p>
<p><strong>What was the key message?</strong> The key message for me was PySpark makes manipulating Spark for large-scale data processing super intuitive and straight-forward.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find out more?</strong> The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hkarau/a-really-really-fast-introduction-to-py-spark-lightning-fast-cluster-computing-with-python-1" title="A really really fast introduction to PySpark - Lightning fast cluster computing with Python - Google Slides" target="_blank">tutorial slides</a> are on SlideShare.</p>
<p>I especially liked the coverage of:</p>

<h2><span id="Learn_to_Build_an_App_to_Find_Similar_Images_using_Deep_Learning">Learn to Build an App to Find Similar Images using Deep Learning</span></h2>
<p><strong>One-sentence summary?</strong> An awesome tutorial providing hands-on manipulation of deep learning tasks through <a href="http://dato.com/" title="Dato" target="_blank">Dato</a>‘s <a href="https://dato.com/products/create/" title="GraphLab Create | Dato" target="_blank">GraphLab platform</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the speaker?</strong> <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/speaker/profile/103/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Piotr Teterwak" target="_blank">Piotr Teterwak</a> (from Dato) gave this <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/schedule/presentation/69/" title="PyData Seattle 2015 | Presentation: Learn to Build an App to Find Similar Images using Deep Learning" target="_blank">fantastic tutorial</a>. He seems super knowledgeable and provided the history, motivation and difficulties of deep learning.</p>
<p><strong>What was the key message?</strong> My key takeaway is Dato’s GraphLab platform makes it super easy to play with and inspect the complexities of deep learning. However, I also enjoyed the history, motivation and difficulties of deep learning that Piotr went over.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find out more?</strong> The <a href="https://dato.com/events/training/2015_pydata_seattle.html" title="Learn to Build an App to Find Similar Images using Deep Learning | Dato" target="_blank">tutorial materials</a> are available from Dato.</p>
<p>The IPython Notebooks (check out step 2 from the <a href="https://dato.com/events/training/2015_pydata_seattle.html" title="Learn to Build an App to Find Similar Images using Deep Learning | Dato" target="_blank">tutorial materials</a>) from the tutorial are fantastic.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the 3 exercises:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hand-written digit recognition of the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" title="MNIST handwritten digit database" target="_blank">MNIST dataset</a></li>
<li>Implementing a dress recommender</li>
<li>Deploying the dress recommender as a service</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="Now_it8217s_your_turn8230">Now it’s your turn…</span></h2>
<p>Ready to rock with these PyData tutorials?</p>
<p>Then download the tutorials to get rolling right away.</p>
<p>The simulation tutorial is probably the easiest to get setup. The deep learning one is slightly more challenging, but super rewarding!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
