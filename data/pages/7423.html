<p>I am attempting to port a Django project over to Docker-Compose for deployment purposes.</p>

<p>I followed a variety of tutorials online and from my understanding, the only services my App requires are Django and Postgres. Here is my docker-compose.yml file:</p>

<pre><code>db:
  image: postgres:latest
  ports:
    - "5432"
  environment:
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    POSTGRES_USER: postgres
web:
  build: .
  ports:
   - "8000:8000"
  volumes:
   - .:/code
  links:
   - db
  command: python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
</code></pre>

<p>I have tested the python command locally in my virtualenv and the server starts, however, when I run 'docker-compose up' in the folder a copy of the application is located in, I get this output:</p>

<p>No message about the server starting or anything like that, I know its compiling my code due to the warning messages about deprecation but I am quite stumped here. Can anyone see my error?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Upon closer inspection and changing the port for the DJango server, I find that accessing the webpage returns a "Connection to the Server was reset while the page was loading" error. This indicates that something is being set up on that page. But I still cannot access it. I know Docker-Compose is working as simple Django applications from tutorials work just fine.</p>
