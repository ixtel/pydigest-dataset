<p><a href="http://antiboredom.github.io/audiogrep">Audiogrep</a> is a python script that transcribes audio files and then creates audio “supercuts” based on search phrases. It uses <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/">CMU Pocketsphinx</a> for speech-to-text, and <a href="http://pydub.com/">pydub</a> to splice audio segments together.</p>
<p>This is a sister project to my <a href="http://github.com/antiboredom/videogrep">videogrep</a> script, which does a similar thing but with video (and makes use of subtitle tracks rather than speech-to-text).</p>
<p>So far I’ve mostly been experimenting with audio books. Here, for example, are all the phrases in <em>How Google Works</em> by Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg that contain the word “data”.<br/>
</p>
<p>And here are all the references to “private wealth” in <em>Capital in the Twenty-first Century</em> by Thomas Piketty:<br/>
</p>
<p>You can also extract just individual words, rather than phrases.</p>
<p>For example, here are all instances of “money” and “people” from the book <em>The Automatic Millionaire: A Powerful One-Step Plan to Live and Finish Rich</em> by David Bach:<br/>
</p>
<p>“Control”, “psychological”, “behavior” and  “situations” from the nightmarishly titled <em>Get Anyone to Do Anything: Never Feel Powerless Again — With Psychological Secrets to Control and Influence Every Situation</em> by David J. Lieberman<br/>
</p>
<p>And here’s “relax”, and “large” from <em>Breast Enlargement Hypnosis</em>, a truly remarkable audio experience by Victoria Gallagher.<br/>
</p>
<p>Another experiment from the same amazing source:<br/>
</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use the script to create “frankenstein” sentences. Here’s Bill Clinton telling us to stop voting, sourced from his book <em>My Life</em>:<br/>
</p>
<p>And, by integrating moviepy, you can generate video slideshows like <a href="http://lav.io/2015/02/c-span-excerpts/">these</a> or this:<br/>

<p>The code is available on <a href="http://antiboredom.github.io/audiogrep">github</a>. Next up I’ll be integrating some of this functionality into <a href="http://github.com/antiboredom/videogrep">videogrep</a> for more refined searches.</p>
