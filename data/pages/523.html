    <p>There are many markdown parsers in Python. Misaka was my favorite one.
However, misaka is deprecated now, and the successor which is called
hoedown still has issues to solve. That's why it is a <strong>was</strong>. But I still
love it.</p>
<p>Here is a list of markdown parsers for Python in my knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Misaka: A python binding for Sundown. (CPython required)</li>
<li>Hoedown: A python binding for Hoedown, successor of Misaka.</li>
<li>Discount: A python binding for Discount. (CPython required)</li>
<li>cMarkdown: Markdown for Python, accelerated by C. (CPython required)</li>
<li>Markdown: A pure markdown parser, the very first implementation.</li>
<li>Markdown2: Another pure markdown parser.</li>
</ul>
<p>And I've just released another pure markdown parser too, which is called
<strong><a href="https://github.com/lepture/mistune">mistune</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>Misaka</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FSX/misaka">Misaka</a> was my favorite markdown parser. It
is a python binding of Sundown, which means that it has all the features
that Sundown provides.</p>
<p>It is super fast! Actually, it is the top one in my benchmarks. Since it is
a binding of a C library, no wonder that it is this fast. If speed is what
you want, you should try misaka, and as well as other bindings of a C library.</p>
<p>But misaka is more than speed. It is the custom renderer feature that catches
my heart. I am so fond of it, that's why I implement the custom renderer
feature in my own markdown parser <strong>mistune</strong>.</p>
<p>A quick and very useful sample is <a href="http://misaka.61924.nl/manual/#toc_15">code highlighting</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is a binding of a C libary. It requires CPython, if you prefer
PyPy, you have no access to it. Some App Engines have a limitation on compiling
C libraries too, you can't use misaka in this case. And even if you are
using CPython, it is still difficult to install it on a Windows OS.</p>
<blockquote><p>Visual Studio's support for C is not optimal and most VS compilers are
missing stdint.h, which is needed to compile Misaka.</p>
</blockquote><p>If you are on a Windows, may god helps you. I don't care it a shit.</p>
<p>Footnote feature is missing in Misaka. Maybe many of you don't need such a
thing, in this case, misaka has nothing bad. It is stable, efficient, and
has many GFM features.</p>
<p>The only trouble is Sundown is deprecated.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-sundown-deprecated"><a href="#fn-sundown-deprecated" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>Hoedown</h2>
<p>Because the Sundown library is deprecated, here comes hoedown<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-c-hoedown"><a href="#fn-c-hoedown" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>,
which is the fork of the original Sundown. It has a Python binding also
called as hoedown.</p>
<p>Since Hoedown is the successor of Sundown, and <a href="https://github.com/hhatto/python-hoedown">python-hoedown</a> is the successor of Misaka, all features
that misaka has, python-hoedown has them too. But python-hoedown is more
than that.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is PyPy compatible.</li>
<li>It has footnote feature.</li>
</ol>
<p>It looks promissing, and even misaka's author recommends it. I've tried it,
but failed with one issue, <a href="https://github.com/hhatto/python-hoedown/issues/5">a magic error</a> that I can't do anything:</p>
<pre><code>terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)</code></pre>
<p>This isssue is not fixed yet. Once it does, <del>hoedown would be a good choice</del>
for non-AE users.</p>
<p><em>Updated at Jun 23, 2014</em>: you can use <a href="https://github.com/Anomareh/Hoep">Hoep</a> as the Python Binding.</p>
<h2>cMarkdown &amp; Discount</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/paulsmith/cMarkdown">cMarkdown</a> is much like Misaka,
except that it is based on upskirt<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-upskirt"><a href="#fn-upskirt" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> rather than sundown. The
history is very interesting, sundown is a fork of upskirt, hoedown is a
fork of sundown. And now, sundown is deprecated, upskirt is missing. The
new markdown parser that vmg promised is still not available.</p>
<p>cMarkdown has all the disadvantages of Misaka, and it is a little slower
than Misaka. This means you really should use misaka instead of cMarkdown.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Discount is a joke for me, I can't even install it successfully! There is
not much to say. But I do know that Discount is slower than Sundown.</p>
<h2>Markdown &amp; Markdown2</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/waylan/Python-Markdown">Python-Markdown</a> is the very first markdown parser in pure Python. It is
good, except the documentation. However, I miss the renderer feature in
misaka, which is not in Python-Markdown.</p>
<p>Python-Markdown is not that slow as I expected, since Python-Markdown2
calls itself as:</p>
<blockquote><p>A fast and complete implementation of Markdown in Python.</p>
</blockquote><p>But it is not true. Python-Markdown2 is much slower than Python-Markdown.
I have no idea why it says itself fast. All features that 2 has, the older
one has too.</p>
<p>The benchmark shows that Python-Markdown2 is almost twice slower than
Python-Markdown. No wonder it is 2.</p>
<h2>Mistune</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lepture/mistune">Mistune</a> is a new (just released)
markdown parser. It is the <strong>fastest</strong> one in all pure Python implementations.
Almost <strong>4 times faster</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-bench"><a href="#fn-bench" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> than Python-Markdown in pure Python
environment, almost <strong>5 times faster</strong> with Cython's help.</p>
<p>I didn't expect it to be so fast when I wrote it. I know it would be a fast
one, but I didn't know that it would be 4 times faster and even 5 times
faster.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I have never thought of creating a Markdown parser my own. But it has been
months since I reported the issue to Hoedown. The issue is still there,
not solved a bit. Because it is a C binding, I am not able to do any help,
the only thing I can do is waiting.</p>
<p>I don't use Python-Markdown or Python-Markdown2, because they have no renderer
feature, and they are slow.</p>
<p>I have <a href="/en/2013/unpleasant-open-source">introduced renderer feature to marked</a>, which is
finally merged. And now I am trying to add the <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked/pull/351">footnote feature</a>.
It occured to me that I can port marked to Python, since I know marked well,
and I know it is the fastest in all pure JavaScript implementations. It
would be fast in Python too, and it really does.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you are looking for a fast, full featured<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-mistune-features"><a href="#fn-mistune-features" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> and pure
Python implementation, Mistune is a good choice. It also has renderer
feature just like Misaka. You can always influnce the rendering results
with custom renderers.</p>

<p>Mistune can be compiled with Cython if you have Cython installed already.</p>

<p>The magic happens in the <code>setup.py</code> script. I'd like to introduce this part
another time.</p>
<p><strong>mistune is used by many great projects such as IPython, Rodeo and crossbar.</strong></p>
