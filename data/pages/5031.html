<h1 class="title">lxml - XML and HTML with Python</h1>


<p class="eyecatcher">lxml is the most feature-rich
and easy-to-use library
for processing XML and HTML
in the Python language.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The lxml XML toolkit is a Pythonic binding for the C libraries
<a class="reference external" href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">libxslt</a>.  It is unique in that it combines the speed and
XML feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a
native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the well-known
<a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a> API.  The latest release works with all CPython versions
from 2.6 to 3.5.  See the <a class="reference external" href="intro.html">introduction</a> for more information about
background and goals of the lxml project.  Some common questions are
answered in the <a class="reference external" href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="support-the-project">
<h1>Support the project</h1>
<p>lxml has been downloaded from the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml">Python Package Index</a> more than
two million times and is also available directly in many package
distributions, e.g. for Linux or MacOS-X.</p>
<p>Most people who use lxml do so because they like using it.
You can show us that you like it by blogging about your experience
with it and linking to the project website.</p>
<p>If you are using lxml for your work and feel like giving a bit of
your own benefit back to support the project, consider sending us
money through PayPal that we can use for fixing bugs in the software
and improving its features and documentation.  Please read the Legal
Notice below, at the bottom of this page.  Thank you for your support.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>The complete lxml documentation is available for download as <a class="reference external" href="lxmldoc-3.5.0.pdf">PDF
documentation</a>.  The HTML documentation from this web site is part of
the normal <a class="reference external" href="#download">source download</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tutorials:
</li>
<li>ElementTree:
</li>
<li>lxml.etree:
</li>
<li>lxml.objectify:
</li>
</ul>
<p>lxml.etree follows the <a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a> API as much as possible, building
it on top of the native libxml2 tree.  If you are new to ElementTree,
start with the <a class="reference external" href="tutorial.html">lxml.etree tutorial for XML processing</a>.  See also the
ElementTree <a class="reference external" href="compatibility.html">compatibility</a> overview and the <a class="reference external" href="performance.html">ElementTree performance</a>
page comparing lxml to the original <a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/zone/celementtree.htm">cElementTree</a>
implementations.</p>
<p>Right after the <a class="reference external" href="tutorial.html">lxml.etree tutorial for XML processing</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a> documentation, the next place to look is the <a class="reference external" href="api.html">lxml.etree
specific API</a> documentation.  It describes how lxml extends the
ElementTree API to expose libxml2 and libxslt specific XML
functionality, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/">XPath</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.relaxng.org/">Relax NG</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML Schema</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n">c14n</a>.  Python code can be called from XPath expressions and XSLT
stylesheets through the use of <a class="reference external" href="extensions.html">XPath extension functions</a>.  lxml
also offers a <a class="reference external" href="sax.html">SAX compliant API</a>, that works with the SAX support in
the standard library.</p>
<p>There is a separate module <a class="reference external" href="objectify.html">lxml.objectify</a> that implements a data-binding
API on top of lxml.etree.  See the <a class="reference external" href="FAQ.html#what-is-the-difference-between-lxml-etree-and-lxml-objectify">objectify and etree</a> FAQ entry for a
comparison.</p>
<p>In addition to the ElementTree API, lxml also features a sophisticated
API for <a class="reference external" href="element_classes.html">custom XML element classes</a>.  This is a simple way to write
arbitrary XML driven APIs on top of lxml.  lxml.etree also has a
<a class="reference external" href="capi.html">C-level API</a> that can be used to efficiently extend lxml.etree in
external C modules, including fast custom element class support.</p>

<div class="section" id="download">
<h1>Download</h1>
<p>The best way to download lxml is to visit <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/">lxml at the Python Package
Index</a> (PyPI).  It has the source
that compiles on various platforms.  The source distribution is signed
with <a class="reference external" href="pubkey.asc">this key</a>.</p>
<p>The latest version is <a class="reference external" href="/files/lxml-3.5.0.tgz">lxml 3.5.0</a>, released 2015-11-13
(<a class="reference external" href="/changes-3.5.0.html">changes for 3.5.0</a>).  <a class="reference external" href="#old-versions">Older versions</a>
are listed below.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the
<a class="reference external" href="installation.html">installation instructions</a> !</p>
<p>This complete web site (including the generated API documentation) is
part of the source distribution, so if you want to download the
documentation for offline use, take the source archive and copy the
<tt class="docutils literal">doc/html</tt> directory out of the source tree, or use the
<a class="reference external" href="lxmldoc-3.5.0.pdf">PDF documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The latest installable developer sources should usually be available from the
<a class="reference external" href="http://lxml.de/build/">build server</a>.  It's also possible to check out
the latest development version of lxml from github directly, using a command
like this (assuming you use hg and have hg-git installed):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
hg clone git://github.com/lxml/lxml.git lxml
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you use git, this should work as well:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone git://github.com/lxml/lxml.git lxml
</pre>
<p>You can browse the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lxml/lxml/">source repository</a> and its history through
the web.  Please read <a class="reference external" href="build.html">how to build lxml from source</a>
first.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lxml/lxml/blob/master/CHANGES.txt">latest CHANGES</a> of the developer version are also
accessible.  You can check there if a bug you found has been fixed
or a feature you want has been implemented in the latest trunk version.</p>
