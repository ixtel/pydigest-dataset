<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Knows about HTTP status codes</strong>. When you write a "Hello World"
application it does not matter that there are other status codes
besides <tt class="docutils literal">200 OK</tt>, but in real world applications you want your
application to know about <tt class="docutils literal">404 Not Found</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">405 Method Not
Allowed</tt>, and so on.</p>
<p>Morepath does not make you write write verbose and failure-prone
special cased code to handle status codes. Instead, <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/better-rest-with-morepath-08.html#what-about-http-status-codes">Morepath does
HTTP status codes correctly right away.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Morepath makes hyperlinks to objects</strong>. In a typical routing web
framework, to make a URL, you need to remember the name of a route,
the parameters that go into the route, and how to get that
information from the object to which you are making the route. This
leads to duplicated code and hardcodes route names
everywhere. Since it does so little, it encourages you to skip it
entirely and write even more hardcoded URL generation code
everywhere.</p>
<p>Morepath makes it <em>easier</em> to do the right thing. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/superpowers.html#link-with-ease">Morepath lets
you link to Python objects</a>. Morepath
also understands URL parameters can be part of URLs too, and can
create a link with them in there for you too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Built-in permission system</strong>. Morepath does not leave something
as important as security entirely up to extensions. The core
framework knows that views can be guarded with permissions. Who has
what permission for what object is then up to you, and <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html">Morepath
lets you define permissions powerfully and succinctly.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Compose applications</strong>. If you have a project application and a
wiki application, you can mount the wiki application into the
project applications. You can develop and test applications
independently, and then combine them later. These are true
coarse-grained components. This way, <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/building_large_applications.html">Morepath lets build large
applications out of smaller ones.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>All views are reusable</strong>. Morepath does not have a separate
sub-framework to let you write more reusable and generic views than
the normal ones. Instead <em>any</em> view you create in Morepath is
already reusable. And remember - you don't have to hardcode route
names, which makes views more generic by default.</p>
<p>Views in Morepath are true fine-grained reusable components,
without extra work. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/superpowers.html#generic-ui">Morepath gives you the tools to build a
generic UI</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/superpowers.html#composable-views">You
can reuse views with ease with Morepath.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Subclass applications</strong>. Morepath does not have a separate
sub-framework to let you write reusable blueprints for
applications. Instead, <em>any</em> application you create in Morepath is
already reusable in that way. In the real world, applications
evolve into frameworks all the time, and Morepath does not stand in
your way with special cases.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/app_reuse.html">You can subclass any Morepath app to add new routes and views, or
override existing
ones.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Made for the modern web</strong>. Many modern web applications feature a
REST backend with a rich, client-side frontend written in
JavaScript. <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/rest.html">Morepath is written to support REST from the ground up</a> - it's not
a layer over something else, but it's not a constraining HTTP API
generation tool either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Extensible framework</strong>. Morepath lets you extend the web
framework in the same way it lets you extend applications written
in it. You can write new Morepath directives and framework
applications. As examples, <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/more.static.html">more.static</a> adds
advanced browser static resource handling to Morepath,
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.transaction">more.transaction</a>
integrates Morepath with transaction based databases such as
SQLAlchemy and the ZODB, and <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.forwarded/">more.forwarded</a> adds HTTP
Forwarded header support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Micro framework with macro ambitions</strong>. Morepath is a micro
framework; it's not a lot of code. It's easy to get an overview of
what's going on, and it's easy to embed in a larger
application. <strong>Morepath packs a lot more punch in a small amount of
code than your typical Python micro web framework</strong>.</p>
<p>All this does not come at the cost of performance. <strong>When the
primary selling point of a Python web framework seems to be
performance, perhaps it's not doing enough for you.</strong> But Morepath
has more than adequate performance - <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/better-rest-with-morepath-08.html#faster">on "Hello world" at least
Morepath outpaces some very popular web Python frameworks comfortably</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first"><strong>Documentation</strong>. Some Python micro frameworks also have micro
documentation. Instead, <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org">Morepath has lots of docs</a>.</p>
</li>
