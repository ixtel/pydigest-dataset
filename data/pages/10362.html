<p>Well, when I had such problem, I used to create a custom field model, with a name field and a type field, usually a choice field with choices for the possible field types. You can also add a is_active field to filter the active and inactive CustomFields.</p>

<p>Than, when I create the for, I search this objects to know which fields I must have in that form.</p>

<p>To store the data, I'd have another model, called CustomFieldAnswer, or somethink like this. This model should have a ForeignKey to the main model that should have this data, and the custom field.</p>

<p>Doing so, You can have any kinds of fields for yout model dinamically and wothout you client needing to code anything.</p>

<p>You could use metaprogramming to create acutual fields in a form based on the query in the CustomFields. Or, you could just put the fields in the template and change the type of the input for each CustomField.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>
