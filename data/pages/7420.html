<p>For our November meetup, we'll have Stan Seibert presenting a talk "The Art and Science of Accelerating Python".  He will cover a survey of various tools and techniques available in the Python ecosystem for speeding up your code.  Come with your questions and join the conversation with your own experiences.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I'll moderate a discussion about Python 2 and Python 3.  This is inspired by some conversations that happened at PyData NYC this week, and I'm curious to hear from Austin Python users about their own views and experiences with all aspects of this topic.  Have newcomers to the language found it confusing?  Have experienced devs with existing codebases found the porting process easy, or found it a barrier?  I think that it would be interesting to hear people's first-hand experiences with this topic, and look forward to a stimulating discussion!</p>
 
<p>Thanks to Capital Factory and Atlassian for their support and for hosting us!</p>
