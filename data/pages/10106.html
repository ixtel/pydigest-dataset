        <h5>Filip Schouwenaars</h5>
        <p>Filip is the passionate developer behind many of DataCamp's interactive courses, covering both Python and R. Under the motto 'Eat your own dog food', he leverages the techniques DataCamp teaches its students to perform data analysis for DataCamp. Filip holds degrees in Electrical Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. <br/><br/> Patrick Varilly (Data Minded) has been closely involved throughout the development of this course. His feedback has been extremely helpful. Vincent Vankrunkelsven has put a great effort in outlining and reviewing this course. He also programmed the logic to give students the feedback they need in the interactive coding challenges. Our video guy Fernando Silva was responsible for directing, recording and editing the tutorial videos.</p>
