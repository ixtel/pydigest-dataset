<pre>hyuki-graph <span class="o">[</span>option<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>base_dir<span class="o">]</span>
</pre>
<p>where, <tt>base_dir</tt>is a the most top directory which is watched by this program.</p>
<p>Note that default <tt>base_dir</tt>is <tt>.</tt>.</p>
<p>This is a tool like as  <a href="https://note.mu/hyuki/n/n9a6e7c1e0d7b" rel="nofollow">taking-star-table with color</a> (ja),
which considered by Mr. Hyuki.</p>
<p>This tool makes table which is written project-name, day number from today and commit-status.</p>
<p>Also, if there is <tt>hyuki_graph.json</tt> or <tt>hyuki_graph.yaml</tt> file in directory, which this program watch, this program make
a table by using commits number which got by CVS and content of the file.</p>
<p>Furtheremore, if cross point which project-name and day number is written D by red color,
this means that the project does not committed.</p>
<p>If it is written M by yellow color, this means that the project is committed some times less than 10.</p>
<p>If it is written L by green color, this means that the project is committed some times more than or equal to 10.</p>

  e.t.c.
project name:
  date: commit number
  date: commit number
  e.t.c.
