<p><b>Talk #1: Developing Eventbrite Using Docker by Andrew Godwin</b>  <br/></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> 
<p>Eventbrite is comprised of tens of different components - services, databases, tools and more, and running that all on a single virtual machine is fragile. Learn how we used Docker and our own tool "tugboat" to create a development environment where you can rebuild parts at a time, run different subsets of the site depending on the problem, and easily change and add new containers. <br/></p> 
<p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p>
<p>Andrew is a Django core developer and the primary author of both South and the new Django migrations framework. He works as a Senior Software Engineer on Eventbrite's Architecture team, and has spent much of the past decade making databases do things they were never designed for. In his spare time, he also enjoys archery and flies private planes. <br/></p>

<p><b>Talk #2: Deploying Django with Kubernetes by Bill Prin</b>  <br/></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestrator tool that helps schedule, network, and scale Docker containers across a cluster. It can run on a variety of cloud providers or bare metal, and recently released version 1.1 which introduces cluster auto-scaling features. In this talk, we will demonstrate deploying a Django app to Kubernetes, and talk about how Kubernetes compares to other Django deployment options.</p>
<p><b>Speaker Bio:</b></p>
<p>Bill Prin is a Developer Programs Engineer at Google. He works on the oauth2client library and other open-source Python projects for Google Cloud. Previously, he worked at a variety of NYC startups. </p>
