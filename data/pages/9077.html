<p>A powerful declarative parser/builder for binary data</p>








<p>Construct is a powerful <strong>declarative</strong> parser (and builder) for binary data.</p>
<p>Instead of writing <em>imperative code</em> to parse a piece of data, you declaratively
define a <em>data structure</em> that describes your data. As this data structure is not
code, you can use it in one direction to <em>parse</em> data into Pythonic objects,
and in the other direction, convert (“build”) objects into binary data.</p>
<p>The library provides both simple, atomic constructs (such as integers of various sizes),
as well as composite ones which allow you form hierarchical structures of increasing complexity.
Construct features <strong>bit and byte granularity</strong>, easy debugging and testing, an
<strong>easy-to-extend subclass system</strong>, and lots of primitive constructs to make your
work easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fields: raw bytes or numerical types</li>
<li>Structs and Sequences: combine simpler constructs into more complex ones</li>
<li>Adapters: change how data is represented</li>
<li>Arrays/Ranges: duplicate constructs</li>
<li>Meta-constructs: use the context (history) to compute the size of data</li>
<li>If/Switch: branch the computational path based on the context</li>
<li>On-demand (lazy) parsing: read only what you require</li>
<li>Pointers: jump from here to there in the data stream</li>
</ul>

<p>Note</p>
<p><a href="http://tomerfiliba.com/blog/Survey-of-Construct3/" rel="nofollow">Construct3</a> is a rewrite of Construct2;
the two are incompatible, thus <tt>construct3</tt> will be released as a <em>different package</em>.
Construct 2.5 is the last release of the 2.x codebase.</p>
<p>Construct 2.5 drops the experimental text parsing support that was added in Construct 2.0;
it was highly inefficient and I chose to concentrate on binary data.</p>

<div id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>A <tt>PascalString</tt> is a string prefixed by its length:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from construct import *
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; PascalString = Struct("PascalString",
...     UBInt8("length"),
...     Bytes("data", lambda ctx: ctx.length),
... )
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; PascalString.parse("\x05helloXXX")
Container({'length': 5, 'data': 'hello'})
&gt;&gt;&gt; PascalString.build(Container(length = 6, data = "foobar"))
'\x06foobar'
</pre>
<p>Instead of specifying the length manually, let’s use an adapter:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; PascalString2 = ExprAdapter(PascalString,
...     encoder = lambda obj, ctx: Container(length = len(obj), data = obj),
...     decoder = lambda obj, ctx: obj.data
... )
&gt;&gt;&gt; PascalString2.parse("\x05hello")
'hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; PascalString2.build("i'm a long string")
"\x11i'm a long string"
</pre>

<div id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Construct should run on any Python 2.5-3.3 implementation.</p>
