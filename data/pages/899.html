<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/"><strong>mxODBC Connect</strong></a><a class="egenix-tm" href="http://www.egenix.com/company/legal/trademarks.html">™</a> Database Interface for Python allows users to 
  easily connect <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> applications to all major databases on the 
 market today in a highly portable, convenient and secure way. </p>
<h3>Python Database Connectivity the Easy Way<br/>
</h3>
<p>Unlike our <a href="http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBC/">mxODBC Python extension</a>, mxODBC Connect is designed as <strong>client-server application</strong>, so you no longer need to find production quality ODBC drivers for all the platforms you target with your Python application. </p>

<p>Instead you use an easy to install <b>royalty-free Python client library</b> which
connects directly to the mxODBC Connect database server over the
network.</p>
<p>This makes 
    <a href="http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/">mxODBC Connect</a> a great basis for writing <strong>cross-platform multi-tier database 
   applications</strong> and utilities in Python, especially if you run applications that need to communicate with databases such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/">MS SQL Server</a> and <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/access/">MS Access</a>, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/database/index.html">Oracle Database</a>, <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/">IBM DB2</a> and <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/informix/">Informix</a>, <a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/databasemanagement/adaptiveserverenterprise">Sybase ASE</a> and <a href="http://www.sybase.com/products/databasemanagement/sqlanywhere">Sybase Anywhere</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/maxdb">SAP MaxDB</a> and many more, that run on Windows or Linux machines.</p>

<h3>Ideal for Database Driven Client Applications<br/>
</h3>
<p>  By removing the need to install and configure ODBC drivers on the 
client side and dealing with complicated network setups for each set of 
drivers, <a href="http://www.egenix.com/products/python/mxODBCConnect/">mxODBC Connect</a> greatly <span>simplifies 
  deployment</span> of database driven client applications, while 
  at the same time making the network communication between client and 
 database server <strong>more efficient and more secure</strong>.</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<p>mxODBC Connect 2.1.0 is a new minor release of our successful mxODBC Connect 
 product. These are the changes compared to <a href="http://www.egenix.com/company/news/eGenix-mxODBC-Connect-2.0.5-GA.html">mxODBC Connect 2.0.5</a>.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Update to the mxODBC 3.3 API</h3>

<p>mxODBC Connect 2.1 upgrades the mxODBC Connect Client to the new mxODBC 3.3. APIs and 
enhancements.<br/>
</p>

<h4>Stored Procedures</h4>

<ul>
<li>mxODBC Connect now has <b>full support for input, output and input/output parameters</b> in stored procedures and stored functions, allowing easy integration with existing databases systems.<br/>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>User Customizable Row Objects</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Added support for user customizable row objects by adding cursor/connection .rowfactory and .row constructor attributes</b>. When set, these are used to wrap the normal row tuples returned by the .fetch*() methods into dynamically created row objects.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Added new RowFactory classes</b> to support cursor.rowfactory and cursor.row. These allow dynamically creating row classes that provide sequence as well as <b>mapping and attribute access to row fields</b> - similar to what namedtuples  implements, but more efficient and specific to result sets.<br/>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Fast Cursor Types</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Switched to forward-only cursor types for all database backends</b>, since this provides a much better performance for MS SQL Server and IBM DB2 drivers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Added a new .cursortype attribute</b> to allow adjusting and 
inspecting the ODBC cursor type to be used for an mxODBC Connect cursor 
object. Default is to use forward-only cursors, but mxODBC also support 
several other useful cursor types such as static cursors with full 
support for result set scrolling.<br/>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>More new Features</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Enhanced cursor.prepare()</b> to allow querying cursor.description right after the prepare step and not only after calling a cursor.execute*() method.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Added iterator/generator support to .executemany()</b>. The parameters list can now be an iterator/generator, if needed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Added new connection.dbapi</b> property to easily access module level symbols from the connection object.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Timestamp seconds fraction resolution</b> is now determined 
from the scale of a datetime/timestamp SQL column, using the 
connection.timestampresolution as lower bound, when using SQL type 
binding. In Python type binding mode, the connection.timestampresolution 
determines the scale with which a variable is bound. This allows for 
greater flexibility when dealing with database backends that don't 
provide full nano-second second resolution, such as e.g. MS SQL Server.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>mxODBC Connect accepts <b>Unicode string values for date/time/datetime/timestamp column types</b> in SQL type binding mode. Previous versions already did in Python type binding mode.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>mxODBC Connect uses unicode(obj, encoding) semantics</b> 
when binding Python objects to SQLWCHAR Unicode database parameters to provide better compatibility with Python objects. 
Additionally, it ignores the encoding in case obj is a number, to avoid 
conversion errors.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Added new cursor.encoding attribute</b>. This gets its default values from the connection the cursor was created on and allows for per-cursor encoding settings.<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Added cursor.bindmethod</b> which inherits from 
connection.bindmethod when creating the cursor. This allows adjusting 
the variable bind method on a per-cursor basis, rather than only on a 
per connection basis as in previous mxODBC Connect versions. </li>
</ul>

<h3>mxODBC Connect API Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <b>SQL lookup object is cached on the client side</b> to avoid frequent roundtrips when using symbols which are needed for stored procedures with input/output parameters.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The SQL lookup object received support for new <b>ODBC 3.8 symbols</b> and values, including driver specific symbols used by the MS SQL Server Native Client and IBM DB2 ODBC drivers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Improved the server side object management</b> to simplify 
client side garbage collection considerations. Even though we still 
encourage using explicit garbage collection of cursors, connections and 
server sessions on the client side, mxODBC Connect Server will now 
handle most situations even without these explicit calls.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Asynchronous Processing<br/>
</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Tested with the latest gevent and greenlet packages</b>. mxODBC
 Connect Client will happily work together with the asynchronous 
libraries gevent. All it takes is a single configuration entry in the 
client side config file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security Enhancements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Changed the way passwords are stored in the server's 
authorized-users.txt file in order to make password storage more secure.</li><li><b>User authentication now uses salted SHA-256 password hashes</b>
 when transferring the login data from the client to the server. This 
provides better protection when using plain text client server setups and additional security over SSL network connections.<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>ODBC Driver/Manager Compatibility Enhancements</h3>

<h4>unixODBC</h4>

<ul>
<li>mxODBC Connect Server is now built against <b>unixODBC 2.3.2</b> on Linux.</li>
</ul>

<h4>DataDirect</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Updated the DataDirect binding to version 7.1.2</b> of the DataDirect ODBC manager on Linux.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Oracle</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added work-around for <b>Oracle Instant Client</b> to be able to use integer output parameters.</li><li>Added a work-around for <b>Oracle Instant Client</b> to have it 
return output parameters based on the input placeholder Python parameter
 types. It would otherwise return all parameters as strings.</li><li>Disabled a test for <b>Oracle Instant Client</b> which tries to set a pre-connect connection option for timeouts, since the ODBC driver segfaults with this option.</li>
</ul>

<h4>MS SQL Server</h4>

<ul>
<li>mxODBC Connect Server 2.1 defaults to 100ns connection.timestampresolution for <b>MS SQL Server 2008 and later</b>, and 1ms resolution for <b>MS SQL server 2005 and earlier</b>. This simplifies interfacing to SQL Server timestamp columns by preventing occasional precision errors.</li><li>Tested mxODBC Connect Server successfully with new <b>MS SQL Server Native Client 11 for Linux</b>. Unicode connection strings still don't work, but everything else does.</li><li>Added documentation on how to <b>use Kerberos with mxODBC and SQL Server</b> for authentication on both Windows and Linux to the mxODBC User Manual.</li><li>Added note about problems of the <b>FreeTDS ODBC driver</b> dealing with TIME and DATE columns.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sybase ASE</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added work-around for the <b>Sybase ASE ODBC driver</b>, which doesn't always pass back NULL correctly to mxODBC Connect Server on 64-bit Unix systems.</li><li>Changed the variable type binding mode default for the <b>Sybase ASE ODBC driver</b> from Python type binding to SQL type binding, which resolves issues with e.g. the Unicode support for that driver.</li><li>Added note about a segfault problem with the <b>Sybase ASE 15.7 ODBC driver</b> which is caused by the driver corrupting the heap.</li>
</ul>

<h4>IBM DB2</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added work-around for the <b>IBM DB2 ODBC driver</b>, which doesn't always pass back NULL correctly to mxODBC Connect Server on 64-bit Unix systems.</li>
</ul>

<h4>PostgreSQL</h4>

<ul>
<li>Added work-around to force Python type binding for the <b>PostgreSQL ODBC drivers</b>. More recent versions of the driver report supporting SQL type binding, but they don't implement it.</li><li>Added work-around to have <b>PostgreSQL ODBC drivers</b> properly work with binary data for BYTEA columns.</li>
</ul>

<h4>MySQL</h4>

<ul>
<li>mxODBC Connect Server now supports native Unicode with the recent <b>MySQL ODBC drivers</b> - provided you use the Unicode variants of the drivers.</li><li>Changed the default binding mode for <b>MySQL ODBC drivers</b> to Python type binding. This works around a problem with date/time values when talking to MySQL 5.6 servers.</li>
</ul><p>
