      <div class="plain"><pre>dfVFS, or Digital Forensics Virtual File System, provides read-only access to file-system objects from various storage media types and file formats.
The goal of dfVFS is to provide a generic interface for accessing file-system objects, for which it uses several back-ends that provide the actual implementation of the various storage media types, volume systems and file systems.
