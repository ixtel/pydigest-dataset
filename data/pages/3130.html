The Socket is more in line with the standard socket module in python (there's a makefile and a _fileobject for readline just like the standard library). And it looks like performance is still pretty good.</p><p>The only things I can think of right now are the unittests for the socket stuff - they lack good coverage and they were actually made for the previous incompatible cogen socket api. They will be fixed eventually.</p><p>Another thing is that i'm trying to push some patches in the pywin32 module for win32file.TransmitFile and win32file.ConnectEx. But it's going <a class="reference external" href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1962146&amp;group_id=78018&amp;atid=551956">so slow</a> that I'm thinking it isn't going to work out and I'd better write a separate module for the GetQueueCompletionStatus, CreateIoCompletionPort, WSASend, WSARecv, ConnectEx, TransmitFile and avoid all that insane overlapped <a class="reference external" href="http://pywin32.cvs.sourceforge.net/pywin32/pywin32/win32/src/win32file.i?view=markup#l_1065">struct hacking</a> that happens in the win32file module. Wadda ya think?</p></div><p class="tags">This entry was tagged as <a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/tag/cogen/"><span itemprop="keywords">cogen</span></a><a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/tag/python/"><span itemprop="keywords">python</span></a></p></div><p id="disqus_thread"/><noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div></div></body></html>
