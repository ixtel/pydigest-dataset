<html><body><div><p>A content translation framework for django integrated automatically in the normal ORM. Removes the pain of having to think about translations in a django project.</p>



<p>Model translations made easy.</p>
<p>This project adds support for model translations in Django. It is designed to be
unobtrusive, efficient and reliable. On the technical side, it uses an automatically
created <cite>Translations Model</cite> to store translatable fields in arbitrary
languages with a foreign key to the main model, enabling fast queries.</p>
<p>Started in 2011, hvad has grown mature and is now used on large scale applications.</p>
<div id="example-use">
<h2>Example Use</h2>
<blockquote>
Book.objects.all()</blockquote>
<p>Compatible by default: returns all objects, without any translated fields attached.
Starting from v1.0, default behavior can be overriden to work like next query:</p>
<blockquote>
Book.objects.language().all()</blockquote>
<p>Returns all objects as translated instances, but only the ones that are translated
into the currect language. You can also specify which language to get, using e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
Book.objects.language(“en”).all()</blockquote>
<p>Usual queryset methods work as usual: let’s get all books as translated instances,
filtering on the translatable <tt>title</tt> attribute, returning those that have
<tt>Petit Prince</tt> in their French title, ordered by publication date (in their
French edition):</p>
<blockquote>
Book.objects.language(“fr”).filter(title__contains=’Petit Prince’).order_by(‘release’)</blockquote>
<p>Other random examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># last German book published in year 1948
Book.objects.language(“de”).filter(release__year=1948).latest()</p>
<p># other books from the same author as mybook. Cache author as well.
Book.objects.language().select_related(‘author’).filter(author__books=mybook)</p>
<p># books that have “Django” in their title, regardless of the language
Book.objects.language(‘all’).filter(title__icontains=’Django’)</p>
</blockquote>
