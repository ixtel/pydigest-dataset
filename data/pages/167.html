              <h1>asyncio 3.4.3</h1>

              


<p>reference implementation of PEP 3156</p>








<p><strong>This version is only relevant for Python 3.3, which does not include asyncio in its stdlib.</strong></p>
<p>Master repo: <a href="https://github.com/python/asyncio" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/python/asyncio</a></p>
<p>The asyncio module provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded
concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and
other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related
primitives.  Here is a more detailed list of the package contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>a pluggable event loop with various system-specific implementations;</li>
<li>transport and protocol abstractions (similar to those in Twisted);</li>
<li>concrete support for TCP, UDP, SSL, subprocess pipes, delayed calls, and
others (some may be system-dependent);</li>
<li>a Future class that mimics the one in the concurrent.futures module, but
adapted for use with the event loop;</li>
<li>coroutines and tasks based on <tt>yield from</tt> (PEP 380), to help write
concurrent code in a sequential fashion;</li>
<li>cancellation support for Futures and coroutines;</li>
<li>synchronization primitives for use between coroutines in a single thread,
mimicking those in the threading module;</li>
<li>an interface for passing work off to a threadpool, for times when you
absolutely, positively have to use a library that makes blocking I/O calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The implementation of asyncio was previously called “Tulip”.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install asyncio, type:</p>
<pre>pip install asyncio
</pre>
<p>asyncio requires Python 3.3 or later! The asyncio module is part of the Python
standard library since Python 3.4.</p>
<p>asyncio is a free software distributed under the Apache license version 2.0.</p>
</div>

<div id="development">
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>The actual code lives in the ‘asyncio’ subdirectory. Tests are in the ‘tests’
subdirectory.</p>
<p>To run tests, run:</p>
<pre>tox
</pre>
<p>Or use the Makefile:</p>
<pre>make test
</pre>
<p>To run coverage (coverage package is required):</p>
<pre>make coverage
</pre>
<p>On Windows, things are a little more complicated.  Assume ‘P’ is your
Python binary (for example C:Python33python.exe).</p>
<p>You must first build the _overlapped.pyd extension and have it placed
in the asyncio directory, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
C&gt; P setup.py build_ext –inplace</blockquote>
<p>If this complains about vcvars.bat, you probably don’t have the
required version of Visual Studio installed.  Compiling extensions for
Python 3.3 requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 (MSVC 10.0) of any
edition; you can download Visual Studio Express 2010 for free from
<a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads" rel="nofollow">http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads</a> (scroll down to Visual C++ 2010
Express).</p>
<p>Once you have built the _overlapped.pyd extension successfully you can
run the tests as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
C&gt; P runtests.py</blockquote>
<p>And coverage as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
C&gt; P runtests.py –coverage</blockquote>
