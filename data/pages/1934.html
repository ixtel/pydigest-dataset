		<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the last part of a three part series covering our experiences running a coding dojo to improve Python and TDD skills in our team. You can read part 1 <a href="https://blog.deltaforce.io/wordpress/running-a-coding-dojo-to-improve-python-tdd-skills/">here</a> and part 2 <a href="https://blog.deltaforce.io/wordpress/running-a-coding-dojo-to-improve-python-tdd-skills-part-2/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Looking back</strong></strong></p>
<p>After the second dojo session, covered in <a href="https://blog.deltaforce.io/wordpress/running-a-coding-dojo-to-improve-python-tdd-skills-part-2/">part 2</a>, we had concluded the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The TDD process was not being following as we’d expected, despite the fact that the team really seemed to be giving it their best</li>
<li>General code quality issues such as style guide (PEP8) compliance, error handling and the decoupling of code had been visibly improved</li>
<li>We had successfully shown some of the team members how unpleasant it was to work with unclean code</li>
</ol>
<p>In general therefore, we were pleased, but in this last session we really wanted to push the TDD process.</p>
<h1>The Exercise</h1>
<p><strong><strong>Pairing with one teacher per pair</strong></strong></p>
<p>We decided to split the team into pairs and then have one teacher with each team. Each pair would have one person writing the tests and one person getting the tests green, with the pairs swapping roles periodically. With each pair would be a teacher who would be able to see where things were falling down and then jump in quickly to help out.</p>
<p><strong><strong>More dogfooding…</strong></strong></p>
<p>Since the first round of dogfooding (covered in <a href="https://blog.deltaforce.io/wordpress/running-a-coding-dojo-to-improve-python-tdd-skills-part-2/">part 2</a>) had been so successful we decided to rotate the code again. Each pair in the third session had to work on somebody else’s code from the second session.</p>
<p><strong><strong>The last new feature</strong></strong></p>
<p>Some of the team members were getting close to finishing all the previously specified features so we introduced one extra feature which we hoped would cause a lot of pain for people with highly coupled implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 2d grid is now 3d, but instead of wrapping like the other axes it is instead like a 2 layer car park. There is no wrapping in the z axis. e.g. The total grid is now two 2d grids, one above the other. This of course also means that there are now two new directions for the rover; <i>up and down</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with the last session, this new feature was to be completed <i>after all previous features</i>.</p>
<h1>So how did it go this time?</h1>
<p>Since it’s the end of the series, we asked the team if they wanted to write their own conclusions and some of them did. You can read those below, along with my own.</p>
<p><i>Joost Veen</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I found the idea pretty awesome, as well as the effort you guys put into it. Personally, I haven’t put as much time and effort into it as I would have wanted to. That was mainly because I didn’t feel I had enough time on my hands to pull off a result that I could live with. The fact that everybody was told to figure it out by themselves made me a little reluctant at first, because I did not really see the purpose of the whole exercise at the time; maybe that also weighed in on the whole time thing I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Overall, I would like to mention that you guys did a great job.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>David Weterings</i></p>
<blockquote><p>The goal of these sessions was to improve our code quality. Due to limited time we could only explain a few best practices. However, shortly after the sessions I’ve noticed the team putting a lot more effort into ensuring that the code is readable and testable. Letting the team swap code, and thus causing some to receive difficult code, was a real eye-opener for the team. Overall, I’m happy that even with a limited amount of time we’ve been able to change the team’s behaviour.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Ciaran Ó Néill</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Our first kata series is a parable of success by way of failure. The goal of the kata series was to learn TDD, with an eye to clean(er) code. Thinking in terms of well known learning models (shu-ha-ri, Dreyfus, unconscious incompetence-conscious incompetence-etc) and assessing the team as novices in TDD we gave them detailed context-free instruction. The mistake we made was in assuming that the team wanted to learn what we had decided to teach them.</p>
<p>In inspecting &amp; adapting after the first kata, Mark &amp; David asked the guys to work on somebody else’s code in the second kata – this resulted in epiphanies all round. Getting the team to follow the TDD cycle in the third kata was straightforward now that they had viscerally understood why clean code was desirable. Another improvement in the third kata was the close guidance from the teachers. In conclusion – when teaching to novices, detailed context-free instruction is the guts of a successful approach but it is essential to also explicitly link the students general motivation to the projected outcome and to ensure the student has the level of guidance required, every step of the way.</p>
<p>The most important outcome to the kata series was that the team felt they had learned something valuable and reported that the production code that they wrote began to improve as of the first kata. Kudos to teachers &amp; students!</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Mark Coleman</i></p>
<blockquote><p>write a failing test -&gt; implement just enough code to make the test pass -&gt; refactor the code -&gt; repeat</p>
<p>Whilst the above seems very straight-forward, as I watched the pairs tackling the Mars Rover Kata I realised that for a beginner, every one of these ‘simple steps’ contains many tiny little questions to which the answers are not intuitively obvious.</p>
<p>Having a teacher present in the third session helped to move the teams through these roadblocks as they arose. This resulted in the team being able to better concentrate on the TDD process itself.</p>
<p>The most unexpected win however, came from exposing the team to someone else’s code. After struggling with unclean code, the team really <i>wanted </i>to learn how to avoid it, with one team member noting that “Readability is the most important!”</p>
<p>Wherever possible, I will be including code-swaps in future coding dojo sessions.</p></blockquote>
