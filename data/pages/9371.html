                    <p>I'm an open source developer. I use Python, Django, PostgreSQL, JQuery, MongoDB, Memcached, and Redis. I push production code to Linux servers.</p>
<p>And yet:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>My laptop runs Apple's Mac OS X.</li>
<li>My primary editor is Sublime Text.</li>
<li>My production servers are provided mostly by Heroku.</li>
<li>All my sites are hosted on Amazon EC2.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've got nothing against Apple, Heroku, or Amazon, but their tools are not open source.</p>
<p>And that's food for thought.</p>
