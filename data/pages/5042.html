<p>We’ve just run our 2nd <a href="http://london.pydata.org/">PyDataLondon conference</a>, we’ve had around 300 attendees, 3 keynotes, 3 tracks over 3 days. It has been fab! We’ve grown 50% on last year along with 20% female speakers and 20% female attendees (both up on last year). I’m really happy with the results of all the hard work of our conference committee. Here’s <a href="https://twitter.com/pydatalondon/status/612176486523662336">Helena giving</a> our opening keynote:</p>

<p>Video status – forthcoming. Slide status – they’ll get linked in <a href="https://github.com/PyDataLondon/Conf2015">this github repo</a>.</p>
<p>Our keynoters were <a href="https://twitter.com/helenabengtsson">Helena Bengstton</a> (Editor for Data Projects at The Guardian), <a href="http://ericdrass.com/">Eric Drass</a> (the data scientist’s artist-philosopher, see <a href="https://twitter.com/bffbot2">@bffbot2</a> and <a href="http://www.shardcore.org/shardpress/index.php/2015/05/13/theresamaybot/">@theresamaybot</a>) and <a href="http://www.metabrown.com/">Meta Brown</a> (speaker and writer for statistics and business analytics). Meta gave me a copy of her latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Mining-Dummies-Meta-Brown/dp/1118893174">Data Mining for Dummies</a> which covers the CRISP-DM process she discussed – yay and thanks!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/frathgeber/status/613106756412174336">Florian</a> has posted a huge set of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frathgeber/sets/72157654424330159">high quality conf photos</a>, go dig to see some gems!</p>
<p>Our monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/">meetup</a> is now at 1,650 members and our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/events/223254354/">13th meetup</a> is scheduled for Tues July 7th at AHL (near Bank tube) – go RSVP now! If you have questions about Pythonic data science – you’ll get them answered with 200+ folk at our meetups (probably in the pub after – buy beer and talk to folk!).</p>
<p>I gave a talk entitled “<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ianozsvald/ship-it-pydatalondon-2015">Ship It!</a>“, breaking down 10 years of experience on building, running and deploying successful data science projects. It reflects on recent experiences consulting on automated contract recruitment over 1.5 years with <a href="http://elevatedirect.com/">ElevateDirect</a> here in London. I looked at 10 years of my consulting projects, removed those that failed (noting reasons why) and then categorised those that worked into the 4 groups that I start the talk with. After that I build on lessons as the groups build into each other.</p>
<p/>
<p>Peadar Coyle (<a href="https://twitter.com/Springcoil">@springcoil</a>) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thMh_mpp6s8">spoke on deployment recently</a> at PyConItaly, his talk is worth a watch. You’ll probably want to catch up on his PyMC tutorial that we had over the weekend at PyDataLondon.</p>
<p>I’m thinking of writing a book (or something like that) in the future on <a href="http://ianozsvald.com/building-python-data-science-products/">building and shipping data science products</a>, if you’re interested take a look and join the announce list.</p>
<p>In my talk and during the closing notes I made a point to everyone – if there’s one simple thing you do today to help support open source projects (particularly if you use them, but don’t contribute to them in other ways) – please please Cite the Project in Public. scikit-learn has a citations page, this helps them raise money from funding bodies, they justify the funding by showing how it helps companies do more business. All you have to do is write a paragraph’s testimonial and send it to your favourite project. The scikit’s, scipy, numpy, ML tools, matplotlib etc – they’d all love to have new testimonials. It’ll take you 15 minutes, please go do it.</p>
<p>Other reviews:</p>

<p>Since the conference was a huge success it means a good chunk of money was raised for <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>, the non-profit that backs the PyData conferences. As a result the awards and scholarships that they provide to the community including the <a href="http://numfocus.org/programs/fellowships.html">John Hunter scholarship</a>, diversity grants and <a href="http://numfocus.org/programs/women-in-technology.html">women in tech</a>, grants for <a href="http://numfocus.org/projects/index.html">development on tools</a> like AstroPy, IPython, SymPy and Software Carpentry will get a huge boost. Good job all!</p>

<p>UPDATE – David has a <a href="https://github.com/DRMacIver/hypothesis/blob/master/docs/endorsements.rst">testimonials page</a> for his Hypothesis library.</p>
<p>I’ll call out a new project that I mentioned- <a href="https://github.com/tomaugspurger/dsadd">DSADD</a> (Data Scientists Against Dirty Data – now known as <a href="https://github.com/TomAugspurger/engarde">Engarde</a>), a set of decorators to apply to Pandas DataFrames to set constraints on your data. This helps when dealing with dirty data.</p>
<p>I also got to do another book signing for my <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028963.do">High Performance Python</a>, along with Yves and his <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032441.do">Python for Finance</a>:</p>

<p>Our team (my co-chair Emlyn and team Cecilia, Graham, Florian, Slavi and Calvin) did a wonderful job, along with Leah and James (our International Team [they make all the background stuff happen – particularly Leah!]), and Bloomberg’s team including Amy, Kenny and Darren:</p>

<p>Our wonderful sponsors were <a href="http://continuum.io/">Continuum</a> (thanks for PyDatas and for Anaconda!), <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a> (thanks for the venue!), <a href="http://www.pivigo.com/">Pivigo</a>, <a href="http://pivotal.io/">Pivotal</a>, <a href="http://adthena.com/">Adthena</a>, <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a>, <a href="https://plot.ly/">Plotly</a>, <a href="http://www.sainsburys.work/dandt">Sainsburys</a>. Huge thanks to you all for making this possible.</p>
<p>The party last night was in a local Bier Keller with a live Oompah Band (don’t ask!). Much conversation was had <img src="http://ianozsvald.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"/></p>
<p>It was encouraging to see more folk using Python 3.4 at the conference, though still 2.7 was in the majority. I wonder how news that the next Ubuntu (15.10 Wily Werewolf) is <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/ubuntu-15-10-wily-werewolf-to-switch-to-python-3-5-ahead-of-ubuntu-16-04-lts-485226.shtml">switching to Python 3.5</a> in October will help with people’s transition?</p>
<p>If you’re interesting in hearing about PyDataLondon 2016, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6JcFz">join this announce list</a>. It’ll be almost-zero-volume for the next 6 months, I’ll do something with it once we’re planning the next conference.</p>

<p>Finally – if you’re after a Data Science Job, I run a very-low-volume jobs list (mostly for London but for the UK in general), <a href="http://ianozsvald.com/2015/01/18/data-science-jobs-uk-modelinsight-python-jobs-email-list/">read about it here</a>. My ModelInsight also runs data science Python training in London, we announce <a href="https://modelinsight.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=833cadbc54533d1da7935054c&amp;id=2ab4cc9311">new training courses on this list</a>. All the lists are MailChimp (so you can unsubscribe instantly at any time), I rarely post to the lists and I keep it all relevant.</p>
