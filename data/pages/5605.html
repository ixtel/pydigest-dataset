<p>There's something I'm trying to do with wxPython and I can't figure out how. (I'm on Windows 7 and I'm okay with a Windows-only solution.)</p>

<p>I want to catch key events globally. This means key-up, key-down and char events. (I'm trying to build something like AHK in Python.)</p>

<p>Now, I know wxPython allows global hotkeys, but that's not satisfactory, because I want to get all the events, including key up, key down and char. How can I do that? </p>

<p>I tried using pyHook, which almost worked except char events aren't implemented. Char events seem to be tricky and I want to know how to capture them globally. (i.e. in all apps.) I'm also okay with solutions that use other tools except wxPython. (Except not a separate GUI framework, I'm happy with using wxPython for the GUI, just tools for capturing the char events.)</p>
