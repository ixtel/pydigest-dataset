<html><body><div><p>This package provides 2D vector and rectangle classes.  These classes were
written to be used in games, so they have some methods that conveniently tie
into <tt>pyglet</tt> and <tt>pygame</tt>, but for the most part they are quite general
and could be used for almost anything.</p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>In lieu of complete API documentation, here are a few examples showing how to
construct and use use the <tt>Vector</tt> and <tt>Rect</tt> classes provided by this
package:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from vecrec import Vector, Rect
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = Vector(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = Vector(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a + b
Vector(4, 6)
</pre>
<p>Rectangles are more commonly constructed using factory methods:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; Rect.from_size(8, 11)
Rect(0, 0, 8, 11)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rect.from_center(a, 1, 1)
Rect(0, 1, 1, 1)
</pre>
