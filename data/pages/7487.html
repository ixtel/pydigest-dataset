<h2>Re-election of the DSF Board: Call for candidates</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Ola Sitarska</strong> on November 12, 2015 </span>

<p>Historically, the board members of the Django Software Foundation have been elected by the DSF membership; however, once elected, they have sat on the board until they chose to stand down. To improve the accountability of the board, last year all board members were elected for one calendar year. The time has now come for the re-election of the board.</p>
<p>The DSF is calling for candidates to stand for election to the DSF board. Two members of the current board have indicated their interest in continuing to serve for the 2016 calendar year; however, the election is open to anyone who wishes to serve on the board.</p>
<p>What does a DSF board member do? DSF Board positions are unpaid volunteer positions. DSF board members are expected to participate in a monthly board teleconference, and follow up on any activities generated by that teleconference. Depending on the business presented to the board, this may result in additional work over the course of the month. The work will usually be administrative and organisational in nature -- for example, managing the financial affairs of the DSF, representing the board in legal discussions, or liaising with groups performing work on the DSF's behalf.</p>
<p>We are making a particular call for someone to fill the role of the President. Russell Keith-Magee has served as DSF President for the last 5 years. However, due to his own personal commitments, Russell has decided to stand down. Russell has done an amazing job over the last 5 years, and the DSF wouldn't be the same without him. The Django Software Foundation would like to thank Russell for his diligent service.</p>
<p>In addition, the DSF board is also looking for someone to fill the role of the Tresurer. Stacey Haysler has done an amazing job over the last year, bringing her professional experience into the DSF. Due to her involvement and work at the DEFNA, Stacey decided to focus on it and step down from the DSF.</p>
<p>The following positions need to be filled for the 2016 calendar year:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>President</strong> - Currently held by Russell Keith-Magee (stepping down)</li>
<li><strong>3 Board members</strong> - Currently held by Karen Tracey, Ola Sitarska (stepping down) and Jannis Leidel (stepping down)</li>
<li><strong>Secretary</strong> - Currently held by Andy McKay</li>
<li><strong>Treasurer</strong> - Currently held by Stacey Haysler (stepping down)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once applications for candidacy have been received, the DSF membership will cast votes to select the winning candidates. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/developer-members/">Developer members</a> are individuals appointed by the DSF board in recognition of their service to the Django community. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/corporate-members/">Corporate members</a> are those that have contributed financially to the DSF. If you are interested in becoming a corporate member of the DSF, you can find out more on our <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/corporate-membership/">corporate membership</a> page.</p>
<p>To declare your candidacy for a board position, send an email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:foundation@djangoproject.com">foundation@djangoproject.com</a>, with your name, the position(s) you would like to be considered for, and a one paragraph candidacy statement describing why you should be elected to a DSF board position. This candidacy statement will be distributed to the membership when voting occurs.</p>
<p>The call for candidates closes at 1200 UTC on November 23. If you've got any other questions about the board election process, please <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/contact/foundation/">get in touch</a>.</p>
