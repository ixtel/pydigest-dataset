<h2>DSF grant programme for DjangoCon Europe 2015</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Daniele Procida</strong> on March 7, 2015 </span>

<p>The Django Software Foundation has made US$5000 available for attendees of <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu">DjangoCon Europe 2015</a>, to help meet the costs of travel and accommodation.</p>
<p>The DjangoCon Europe organisers have also made a number of free tickets available which will be allocated to applicants, along with grants, by a committee.</p>
<p>Applications should be made using the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X80_WeywVPkwtqxJU8fEh9KO_l481VkwM9KCGLTLkQs/viewform">grant application form</a>.</p>
<p>The application process will close on 18th March and awards will be made by 1st April.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to apply for funding, but please be aware that there are always applications for more funds than are available, so sadly not everyone's requests for funding can be met.</p>
<p>The DSF is able to provide these grants thanks to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">continued support of donors who support its activities</a>.</p>
