    exercises: <a class="offsite" rel="external" href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> is a nicely
    made collection of programming problems.</p><p>One of the things I like about these problems is there are always two parts,
    and you don't see the second part of the problem until you have solved the
    first part.  This usually leads to refactorings or repurposing of your code,
    which is a valuable exercise in and of itself.</p><p>For many of the problems, there are interesting follow-on questions.  One
    common one would be, "Write the code that generates the sample inputs to
    be sure there's a single answer."  For some of the problems, any random
    input would do, but for some, there's a constraint that has to be met.</p><p>I have a collection of approachable problems at <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/text/kindling.html">Kindling projects</a>.
    If Advent of Code will stay up after Christmas, I'll definitely add it to
    that page.</p><p><a class="offsite" rel="external" href="http://adventofcode.com/day/19">Today's</a> is the first where a
    simple brute force approach isn't going to work, and I'll need a cleverer
    algorithm... Hmmm...</p></div></div></body></html>
