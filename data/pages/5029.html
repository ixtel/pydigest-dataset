<p>The graph immediately below plots the kernel density estimation of timings for each algorithm. I truncate the results, limiting the range to everything less than the 90th percentile. (I'll explain why momentarily.) Bisecting search appears to be the fastest and the most stable. This makes sense. It has nice worse-case properties.</p>
<p>Stochastic acceptance and linear walk both display variability in timings. Again, the timer is not very precise. But, since bisecting search used the same timer, a comparison is possible. Linear walk has a worst case performance of $O(n)$. That is, if it starts at index 0 and generates the maximum value, it has to traverse the entire array. Bisecting search generates a stream of random numbers until finding an acceptable one. Technically, this algorithm has no limit. It could loop infinitely, waiting for a passing condition. But, probabilistically, this is fantastically unlikely. (Sometimes, you come across coders saying code like this is incorrect. That's pretty absurd. Most of the time, the probability of pathological conditions is so small, it's irrelevant. Most of the time, the machine running your code is more likely to crumb to dust before an error manifests.)</p>
<p>For real-time code, timing variability matters. Introduce some jitter into something like a HFT algorithm, and you lose. But, for agent-based models and offline machine learning, variability doesn't matter. For us, averages matter.</p>
