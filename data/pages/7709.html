Our modeling workflow involves the typical “data science” tools: R and IPython for exploratory analysis, Hadoop for batch data processing, and scikit-learn for model building. However, Stripe’s production backend is written in Ruby and uses MongoDB as its data store, and this has introduced difficulties for both model training and production scoring.
