Though Flask is termed a micro-framework, it is no way lacking in functionality; there are many extensions available to Flask which helps it to function at the same level as other large frameworks such as Django and Ruby on Rails.</p><p>This book will demonstrate how to develop a series of web application projects with the Python web micro-framework, and leverage extensions and external Python libraries and APIs to extend the development of a variety of larger and more complex web applications.</p><p>The book will start by explaining Python's Virtualenv library and how to create and switch between multiple virtual environments. You'll first build an SQL database-backed application, which will use Flask-WTF, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Jinja templates, and other methods. Next you'll move on to a timeline application, built using concepts including pytest-Flask, the Blinker package, data modelling for user timelines, exception handling, and creating and organizing CLI tools.</p><p>Moving on, you'll discover how to implement a photo timeline application where you'll explore topics such as writing and running celery tasks, API error handling and testing, and Werkzeug middlewares.</p><p>Finally, the book walks you through creating an application which fetches data from GitHub and stores it locally. You will also learn how to install and configure Flask-Click extension.</p><h2>Style and approach</h2><p>This book covers how to effectively use the Flask micro-framework to develop a series of web applications. Each chapter focusses on the development of an application increasing in complexity with easy steps to follow.</p>       </div>
