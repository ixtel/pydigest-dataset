<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The first place we all go for learning about new libraries is the documentation. Lack of effective documentation can limit the adoption of an otherwise excellent project. In this episode we spoke with Eric Holscher, co-creator of <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read The Docs</a>, about why documentation is important and how we can all work to make it better.</p>
