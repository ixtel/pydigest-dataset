<p>Starting something new can be overwhelming and confusing. Where does
one start? Where does one desire to go? Because Python (the language,
standard library, ecosystem, community, and more) has a such a wide
breadth of functionality, it can be even more daunting.</p>

<p>I have long been impressed by the abstract artistic quality that
subway maps present while still illustrating a path to a
destination. In an attempt to provide a newbie to Python with a
similar experience I attempted a “Map for Python”.</p>

<p><a href="/images/pymap.png"><img class="center" src="/images/pymap.png"/></a></p>

<p>From an artistic point of view, I think it looks more like a melted
and refrozen snowflake. Like a map, there is some abstraction, and it
is in no way complete or up to date. There are many paths through the
Python language, ecosystem that surrounds it, and communities.</p>

<p>There are layers that could go on top linking projects, diversions
along paths, and more. What would you put in a “Path to Python”? I
have probably missed your favorite project.</p>

<p>For those interested in getting on the path, this month I will be
selling a course-<a href="/90py/"><em>90% of Python</em></a>, that will quickly bring an
individual (or a team) to the Beginning point and allow you to jump
off into the vast world of Python.</p>
