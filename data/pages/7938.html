<p><i><b>- Tech Talk from Raymond Hettinger</b></i></p> 
<p>Raymond Hettinger has been a prolific contributor to the CPython project for over a decade, having implemented and maintained many of Python's great features. He has been instrumental in modules like bisect, collections, decimal, functools, itertools, math, random, with types like namedtuple, sets, dictionaries, and many other places around the codebase. He has contributed to the modification of nearly 90,000 lines of code in the CPython repository, and has made over 160 changes in the PEP repository.</p> 
<p>Raymond has also served as a director of the Python Software Foundation, and has mentored many people over the years on their contributions to the python-dev community.  He's also well known for his contributions to the Python Cookbook, and shares many pieces of Python wisdom on Twitter.  He received the Distinguished Service Award at PyCon in Montreal earlier this year for his exceptional contributions to the python community.</p>
