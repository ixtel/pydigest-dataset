<h2>Django 1.8 beta 1 and 1.7.5 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on February 25, 2015 </span>

<p>Today the Django team has released Django 1.8 beta 1, a preview/testing package that
represents the second stage in the 1.8 release cycle and an opportunity for you to try
out some of the changes coming in Django 1.8.</p>
<p>Django 1.8 has been designated as Django’s second “Long-Term Support” (LTS) release.
It will receive security updates for at least three years after its release.
Support for the previous LTS, Django 1.4, will end 6 months from the release date of
Django 1.8.</p>
<p>For full details, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.8/">the in-development 1.8 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Only bugs in new features and regressions from earlier versions of Django will be
fixed between now and 1.8 final (also, translations will be updated following the
"string freeze" when the release candidate is issued). While the beta release was
delayed a week and a half from the originally planned date, we've fixed several issues
that should result in a better experience with the beta. The <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.8Roadmap#schedule">current release schedule</a>
calls for the release candidate in two and half weeks from now. We'll judge from the
number of bug reports we get between now and then whether or not to delay the
release candidate. Watch the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/74_MZK27TAE/discussion">django-developers mailing list thread</a> for updates.</p>
<p>As with all alpha and beta packages, this is <strong>not</strong> for production use. But
if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue tracker</a>), you can grab a
copy of the package from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a>. And as always, signed
MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.8b1.checksum.txt">checksums</a> of the 1.8 beta package are available.</p>
<p>In addition to the beta release, we've issued a bug fix release for the 1.7 series, 1.7.5.
See the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.7.5/">release notes</a> for details.</p>
<p>The PGP key ID used for these releases is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
