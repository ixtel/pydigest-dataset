<h2>BarCamp Django SF!</h2>
<p>On October 4th and 5th <a class="reference external" href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a> will be taking place in the <a class="reference external" href="http://eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> office in San Francisco. <a class="reference external" href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a> is a low-cost, community-focused event that's different than any previous multi-day <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> conference.</p>
<p>How is <a class="reference external" href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a> different than previous Django conferences and events?</p>
<div class="section" id="speakers-are-determined-at-the-event">
<h3>Speakers are determined at the event</h3>
<p>I know what you are thinking. It's something on the line of "<em>What the heck?!?</em>"</p>
<p>It means that if you want to give a talk, you don't need to be an expert. We don't have an formal, extensive review process. It's a chance to share ideas and learn something new. You can be just a Django hobbyist instead of a professional. All you have to be is <strong>passionate</strong>.</p>
<p>At the event, we'll put up a board with slots for talks. Attendees can put themselves into these slots for talks. This makes for a fun, fluid event where new speakers are as welcome as experienced speakers.</p>
<p>While this is meant to be an informal, beginner-friendly event, a professional level of conduct is still required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Speakers, like all attendees must agree to the <a class="reference external" href="https://eb-blog-engineering.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Eventbrite-Code-of-Conduct.pdf">code of conduct</a> (also listed on the <a class="reference external" href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">event page</a>).</li>
<li>No sales or recruiting pitches. Don't even try it!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Camping!</h3>
<p>On the night of October 4th, you can stay overnight at <a class="reference external" href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a>!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a> is 2 days, and will run from 10am Saturday morning until 4pm Sunday in the <a class="reference external" href="http://eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> San Francisco office. Doors will be open throughout the duration of the event and all are welcome to camp out overnight. If you do plan on camping, you'll need to <strong>bring your own sleeping bag, blow up beds, pillows &amp; blankets</strong>.</p>
<p>What's really awesome about camping at <a class="reference external" href="http://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com">BarCamp Django SF</a> is it allows out-of-town attendees to keep their costs low ($15 event cost vs $200+ hotel rooms).</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong> Our definition of 'camping' is staying overnight inside the Eventbrite office in San Francisco. While you can't pitch a tent, you don't have to worry about mosquitoes. Some people will stay up all night, but we'll have quiet areas for those of us who need our 8 hours.</p>
