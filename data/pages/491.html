We’re continuously working on improving the quality of PyCharm, thereby the final release of <strong>PyCharm 3.1.1</strong> includes a number of essential fixes. PyCharm 3.1.1 has the same set of fixes as the last PyCharm 3.1.1 RC build 133.865 had. So <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/PyCharm+133.865+Release+Notes">the release notes</a> for PyCharm 3.1.1 RC also apply to this <strong>final PyCharm 3.1.1 release build 133.881</strong>. The most notable fixes in PyCharm 3.1.1 are: hangs while indexing, test runner and file sync when switching to/from terminal tabs fixes.</p>
