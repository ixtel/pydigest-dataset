<h2>Happy 10th Birthday Django!</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on July 13, 2015 </span>

<p>10 years ago, just before lunch on July 13, 2005, Jacob Kaplan-Moss made the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/d6ded0e91bcdd2a8f7a221f6a5552a33fe545359">first commit to the public repository</a> that would become Django. This was followed by a series of commits by Adrian Holovaty importing from the private repository where Django had lived up to that point.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone could have predicted what would happen in the 10 years that followed that commit. The project has grown from <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/internals/team/#the-original-team">a handful of developers</a> working in Lawrence, Kansas, to an <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/internals/team/#core-team-list">international team of contributors</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/internals/organization/">leadership team</a> has moved from 2 BDFLs to a large group, with elected leaders. We've established the not-for-profit <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a> to steward the future of the framework, and to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">raise funds</a>. Those funds have been used to help the community grow, and to pay the salary of a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/mar/06/welcome-our-full-time-django-fellow/">Django Fellow</a> to keep on top of contributions.</p>
<p>There are three dedicated DjangoCon conferences (in the <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.us/">US</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.eu/">Europe</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.com.au/">Australia</a>) held around the world every year, and countless Django-focussed user groups and smaller events all over the world. These events attract hundreds of attendees. There is also strong Django presence at PyCons and other Python meetups.</p>
<p>The community has also become a leader in social change. We've adopted a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> and a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/">Diversity policy</a> to address issues of harassment and diversity in our community. These policies are now being adopted by many other projects, often using Django's policies as a template. These policies are also backed up by actions - events like <a class="reference external" href="https://djangogirls.org">DjangoGirls</a> directly address issues of diversity in our community.</p>
<p>And, of course, Django continues to be the very best web framework choice for Perfectionists with Deadlines.</p>
<p>Only a fool would try to predict what the next 10 years will hold. The web of 2005 is very different to the web of 2015; we can only imagine what the web of 2025 will look like. But I have no doubt that whatever the outcome, Django will still be there, helping developers turn their dreams into a digital reality.</p>
<p>Happy 10th birthday, Django!</p>
