<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Kay Hayen is a systems engineer from Germany who has dedicated his spare time to the creation of Nuitka, a library that will compile your Python project to C++. In this episode we talked to Kay about what inspired him to create the project, how it operates, and some of the challenges he has faced. It is a very interesting project and it has the potential to let you run your Python code in a whole new way!</p>

<h3>Interview with Kay Hayen</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introductions<ul>
<li>German, family with 2 kids, one cat</li>
<li>Working in ATM (Air Traffic Management), tracker product</li>
<li>Systems Engineer</li>
<li>Nuitka as a hobbyist</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How did you get introduced to Python?<ul>
<li>Once was Perl "Guru".</li>
<li>Python was getting a lot of positive press</li>
<li>Team decision to want to use readable stuff</li>
<li>CPAN was still more complete, but Python was making inroads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you describe how to pronounce the name of your project?<ul>
<li>Wife Anna, Russian, Annuitka -&gt; Nuitka</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you briefly describe what Nuitka is and what your motivation was for creating it?<ul>
<li>I was thinking a fully integrated and compatible compiler should be possible.</li>
<li>Why is nobody doing it?</li>
<li>I can do it.</li>
<li>I am doing it.</li>
<li>Take Python beyond current use cases.<ul>
<li>Everbody currently using Python needs no compiler, or wouldn't use it</li>
<li>Less need for time consuming C++/Python hybrid coding</li>
<li>Simple code should compile to fast code by default</li>
<li>Complex code should still work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the project web site it says that Nuitka does a lot of clever things after being fed a Python project. Can you provide some details as to what some of that cleverness is?<ul>
<li>Re-formulations of Python into simpler Python<ul>
<li>No "class"</li>
<li>No "assert"</li>
<li>No complex assignments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SSA tracing<ul>
<li>Attaching uses to assignments properly<ul>
<li>Despite try/finally</li>
<li>Loops</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoids checks for known defined/undefined values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function inlining (coming)</li>
<li>Constant propagation</li>
<li>Closure variable removal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is libpython and how is it used in both Nuitka and CPython?<ul>
<li>Core of the Python interpreter</li>
<li>With Python VM and C interface</li>
<li>Nuitka can fall back to it</li>
<li>Avoiding it as often as we can, key to performance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there any way to provide hints to Nuitka to generate more optimized output?<ul>
<li>Nuitka is yet to make a difference based on type information</li>
<li>Not yet there, but coming soonish. SSA was pre-requisite</li>
<li>PEP 484 will be unreliable type information, mostly useless</li>
<li>I want type hints that are checked at Python run time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What are some of the biggest challenges in generating statically compiled code from a language as dynamic as Python?<ul>
<li>Python is compiled to .pyc files</li>
<li>Compatible Frame stack, cached</li>
<li>Exception handling of Python is terrible</li>
<li>CPython type system designed to be extensible<ul>
<li>Extension types for functions, bound/unbound methods, generators, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many details to get right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are there any particular Python constructs that Nuitka is unable to translate and as a corollary to that is the compilation step lossy at all or do you have some way of ensuring that the functionality of the program remains unaltered?<ul>
<li>Big point, no price attached</li>
<li>Except for not having bytecode, there is nothing missing</li>
<li>No pdb support</li>
<li>Edit / run cycle is not accelerated</li>
<li>That said: PyQt (integrated), PySide (available, unmerged), wxPython (available, maybe merged) needed patches to take compiled function/method objects for function objects too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are there any particular types of programs that benefit the most from Nuitka's compilation?<ul>
<li>Bindings with ctypes of cffi compile into zero overhead C calls (planned)</li>
<li>Scientific programs are the most obvious goal (float type inference)</li>
<li>CPU bound or low latency programs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is it possible to feed an entire project with multiple modules into Nuitka all at once or is the standard use to perform compilation one source file or submodule at a time?<ul>
<li>You give it the main program and it recurses imports according to "PYTHONPATH"</li>
<li>nuitka --recurse-all "/usr/bin/hg" supposed to work</li>
<li>Might have to give directories with program plug-ins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm curious about what led you to choose compilation to C++ for Nuitka rather than making Nuitka an LLVM back end like Numba?<ul>
<li>When I started Nuitka, I was using C++0x and variadic templates</li>
<li>Wanted to make a proof of concept that compatibility and integration is feasible</li>
<li>From there, code generation got less high level to goto ridden C</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does Nuitka compare to projects like Numba or Cython?<ul>
<li>Graceful degradation goal</li>
<li>Complete compatibility with Python whole stack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does Nuitka compare to PyPy? - Kay<ul>
<li>PyPy is the coolest project ever</li>
<li>Pure Python goals shared</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can users evaluate the performance of Nuitka - Kay<ul>
<li>They currently cannot</li>
<li>Developing a tool to compare CPython and Nuitka runs<ul>
<li>Based on vmprof from PyPy people</li>
<li>Identify parts of program where Nuitka is slower</li>
<li>Links to source code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To be done, help needed.</li>
<li>Nuitka is only starting to get to serious performance<ul>
<li>Compatibility is such a high bar to take</li>
<li>C++ to C took a year (avoiding C++ exceptions)</li>
<li>SSA literally took forever</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
