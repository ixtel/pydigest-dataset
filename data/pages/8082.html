As a software developer, what's the most important application on your computer? If your answer is Microsoft Outlook, my heart goes out to you - stay strong! But for most of us, it's probably a toss up between your web browser and code editor. For editors, there are basically two camps: lightweight smart, text editors such as vim, emacs, and sublime text and heavy weight but highly functional IDEs such as PyDev and PyCharm. This week you'll meet Dmitry Trofimov who is one of the main developers behind one of my favorite editors: PyCharm. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/emacs-the-best-python-editor/" target="_blank">Emacs - the Best Python Editor?</a></span><br/>
Thus far, in our series of posts on Python development environments we've looked at Sublime Text and VIM. In this post we'll present another powerful editor for Python development - Emacs. While it's an indisputable fact that Emacs is the best editor, we'll (try to) keep an open mind and present Emacs objectively, from a fresh installation to a complete Python IDE so that you can make an informed decision when choosing your go-to Python IDE.<br/>

Imagine you're organizing a big tech conference, and you want to understand what people thought of your conference, so you can run it even better next year. Over a 5 day period, we collected about 77,000 tweets about the Web Summit 2015 using the Twitter Streaming API and in this blog series, we're going to explore them and see what we can extract.<br/>

Explore the less well known side of Irish Surfing, using data analysis techiniques with Python and Pandas. Through the use of nearby weather buoy data, we investigate: factors influencing conditions, wave and wind trends, and look to develop a simple criterion of surfable waves.<br/>

<span><a href="http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/" target="_blank">Python List Comprehensions: Explained Visually</a></span><br/>
List comprehensions in Python are great, but mastering them can be tricky because they don't solve a new problem: they just provide a new syntax to solve an existing problem. Let's learn what list comprehensions are and how to identify when to use them.<br/>

<span><a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmcinnes/hdbscan/blob/master/notebooks/Python%20vs%20Java.ipynb" target="_blank">The Development of Python HDBSCAN Compared to the Reference Implementation in Java</a></span><br/>
Python is a great high level language for easily expressing ideas, but people don't tend to think of it as a high performance language; for that you would want a compiled language -- ideally C or C++ but Java would do. This notebook started out as a simple benchmarking of the hdbscan clustering library written in Python against the reference implementation written in Java. It still does that, but it has expanded into an explanation of why I choose to use Python for performance critical scientific computing code.<br/>

Well-researched personas can be a useful tool for marketers, but to do it correctly takes time. But what if you don't have extra time? Using a mix of Followerwonk, Twitter, and the AIchemy language API, it's possible to do top-level persona research very quickly.<br/>

A common misconception about evolution is that "The fittest organisms in a population are those that are strongest, healthiest, fastest, and/or largest." However, as that link indicates, survival of the fittest is implied at the genetic level: and implies that evolution favours genes that are most able to continue in the next generation for a given environment. In this post, I'm going to take a look at a high performing strategy from the Iterated Prisoner's dilemma that was obtained through an evolutionary algorithm.<br/>

This book will walk you through the various steps, starting from simple to the most complex algorithms available in the Data Science arsenal, to effectively mine data and derive intelligence from it. At every step, we provide simple and efficient Python recipes that will not only show you how to implement these algorithms, but also clarify the underlying concept thoroughly.<br/>
