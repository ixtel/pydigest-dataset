<p>A package for constructing decks of playing cards, for games.</p>








<p>PyDealer is a simple to use Python package for “simulating” decks of standard playing cards (also known as a French Deck). PyDealer let’s you easily create <tt>Deck</tt> instances, each containing a full 52 card deck of playing cards. Each card is a separate <tt>Card</tt> instance, with a name, value, suit, and abbreviation. There is also the <tt>Stack</tt> class, which is useful for creating hands, or discard piles, etc. It is the backbone of the PyDealer package, and actually the <tt>Deck</tt> class is just a subclass of the <tt>Stack</tt> class.</p>
<p>PyDealer could possibly be used as part of a CLI (command line interface) card-based game, or even a graphical game as well, I suppose. It may also be of interest to beginner Python programmers, since it’s a relatively simple package, which I created as a way to learn Python, packaging, testing, documentation (Sphinx), etc. I even ended up learning how to use Git a bit, which I must say was slightly frustrating at first. This package has taught me a lot, and maybe someone else can benefit from it as well. Or maybe not. Either way, here it is.</p>
<p>The PyDealer package can be found at the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydealer/" rel="nofollow">Python Package Index</a>, and should be downloaded from there, and, ideally, installed with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/" rel="nofollow">pip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note to Developers</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on this project, please make sure you are working on the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/Trebek/pydealer/tree/dev" rel="nofollow">dev branch</a>, and make your pull requests to that branch. Thanks.</p>

<h2>Quick Usage Example</h2>
<p>Here is a quick example, using IDLE, demonstrating how to construct a new <tt>Deck</tt> instance, representing a full French Deck of cards, as well as how to shuffle the deck, and deal some cards (7 of them) from it, to a hand. Then we’ll print a listing of the contents of the hand, in a human readable way, with a simple print statement.</p>
