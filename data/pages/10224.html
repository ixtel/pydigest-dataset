<p>A CLI utility for blocking until a service is listening</p>








<p>I needed a way to block my app from starting until the database service was running and
accepting connections. This was particularly a problem when using Docker and docker-compose.
You can run this utility as part of a <tt><span class="pre">run-dev.sh</span></tt> or <tt><span class="pre">run-tests.sh</span></tt> script and it will
block for 15 seconds (configurable) until it can connect to the hostname and port as specified
in your connection URL (gleaned from DATABASE_URL environment variable by default).</p>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre>$ pip install urlwait
</pre>
</div>
<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>$ urlwait --help

Usage:

    $ urlwait [SERVICE URL] [TIMEOUT]

    SERVICE URL is a connection url, e.g. a typical value for $DATABASE_URL. TIMEOUT is
    a number of seconds to try to connect to the host and port specified in the SERVICE
    URL. These values may also be specified in environment variables, but command line
    args take precedence:

        URLWAIT_VARNAME: the env var name containing the URL to check. Default DATABASE_URL.
        URLWAIT_TIMEOUT: the number of seconds to wait. Default 15.

    Returns a 0 status if the connection completed successfully before the timeout, or 1 if not.
    It is designed for use with Docker or other dev or testing environments where the connected
    services and the app are started simultaneously, but one should wait for the other.

Examples:

    The following are equivalent:

    $ urlwait redis://localhost:6379/0 20
    $ urlwait $CACHE_URL 20
    $ URLWAIT_VARNAME=CACHE_URL URLWAIT_TIMEOUT=20 urlwait
</pre>
<p>The module is also usable in your python code:</p>
<pre>import os

from urlwait import wait_for_url


if wait_for_url(os.getenv('REDIS_URL')):
    # do things with the service
else:
    # service likely did not start
</pre>
<p>If you don’t have the service URL but do have the host and port, you can use the
<tt>wait_for_service(host, port, timeout)</tt> function instead.</p>
