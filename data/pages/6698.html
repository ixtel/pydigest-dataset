Centuries ago, a revolution in music enabled compositions to last for centuries with no bit rot. There are innumerable parallels between music and software, why don't our programs last longer? Software Engineering has some things to learn from the parallel world of music.<br/><br/>Abstract <br/>A revolution happened in the Renaissance and Baroque eras of music. The musical scales of the time weren't compatible with each other: they used differing intervals and tunings. What was playable on one instrument was not playable on another. The breakthrough happened by making compromises in the tuning of the scales. They became compatible and enabled a revolutionary universal musician's API to emerge: the piano keyboard.<br/><br/>In the world of software, we have business logic, implementations, and abstractions. The more loosely we couple these, the more flexible, resilient and long lasting our software becomes. However, it's not an easy task: our tools and inclinations don't lead us the right way. In software, it may take a step away from purity to achieve the highest level of resiliency.<br/><br/>Using examples from classic Object Oriented Design in Socorro, the Mozilla Firefox Crash Reporting System, I show some enlightening parallels with centuries old music. By accepting abstractions that may be slightly "out of tune", I demonstrate how software can be both flexible and long lived.<br/><br/>And, by the way, this is likely the only conference talk you've ever encountered that features an electric bassoon...<br/><br/><br/><br/>Timothy E. Crosley <br/>Since I was 8 years old I've been passionate about designing and developing software. I get joy out of solving problems in unique ways, and building solutions to enable others to reach their goals. This has lead me to create and contribute to many open source projects in everyone's favorite language: Python. During the day, I work at DomainTools, where I’m helping to develop predictive security solutions on top of truly large data sets. I can’t resist a good craft beer, a new board game, an arcade, or any food that contains peanut butter.<br/><br/>Talk Title "Lets Build the Future with HUG"<br/><br/>Description <br/>In concept, building and exposing HTTP APIs is simple. You have a list of endpoints that read, write, delete, or process data and optionally take arguments that need to match a certain format. A full specification of several APIs could fit onto a single napkin. However, once you get into actually writing the code for an API things get way more complex. You have to worry about converting the data to and from a transportation protocol (most likely JSON), creating and running validation against the specified arguments, taking data from the correct section of the request, providing accurate and up-to-date documentation for users of your API, and separating out the internal API from the external API. Eventually, you may even have to manage multiple versions of your API. In the current landscape, even the most basic APIs quickly expand past napkin size and start spanning multiple pages.<br/><br/>In 45 minutes, I hope to introduce you to a better way.<br/><br/>Together we will create two APIs: 1) a continuous integration server from scratch, and 2) a remotely available to-do list. Both will show you how you can leverage HUG and Python to quickly and succinctly build Web APIs.</p></div>  </div></body></html>
