====

JOSE is a framework intended to provide a method to securely transfer
claims (such as authorization information) between parties. The JOSE framework
provides a collection of specifications to serve this purpose. A JSON Web
Token (JWT) contains claims that can be used to allow a system to apply access
control to resources it owns.

JWTs can be represented as either JSON Web Signature (JWS) or a JSON Web
Encryption (JWE) objects. Claims within a JWS can be read as they are simply
base64-encoded (but carry with them a signature for authentication). Claims
in a JWE on the other hand, are encrypted and as such, are entirely opaque
to clients using them as their means of authentication and authorization.

This library implements JWS and JWEs along with a subset of the
encryption / authentication algorithms recommended by the JOSE framework.
