<h2>Django 1.8 release shirt</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on April 28, 2015 </span>

<p>Last year, to commemorate the release of Django 1.7, we <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/apr/10/getting-ready-django-17/">ran a fundraising campaign</a> selling t-shirts and hoodies with a limited edition, specially commissioned design. That campaign raised almost $10,000 for the Django Software Foundation.</p>
<p>Since it was such a great success, <a class="reference external" href="https://fabrily.com/django18">we're doing it again for the Django 1.8 release!</a> We've commissioned some new artwork from <a class="reference external" href="http://djangogirls.org">Django Girls</a> alumnus <a class="reference external" href="http://trixi.graphics/">Beatrix Bod√≥</a>; we're offering that design in 4 styles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a "Unisex" t-shirt (straight cut, "mens" sizing): $20</li>
<li>a "Womens" fitted t-shirt: $20</li>
<li>a "Womens" v-neck t-shirt: $20</li>
<li>a Hoodie: $25</li>
</ul>
<p>(We're not huge fans of the "mens", "womens" and "unisex" labels for shirts <a class="reference external" href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/T-shirts">for a variety of reasons</a>, but they're the terms in common use in the industry)</p>
<p>UK/European prices will be slightly higher due to VAT.</p>
<p>All profits from the campaign go to the <a class="reference external" href="https://djangoproject.com/foundation">Django Software Foundation</a>, to help fund activities like sprints, travel grants to DjangoCon, and supporting events like <a class="reference external" href="http://djangogirls.org">Django Girls workshops</a>.</p>
<p>It's a crowdfunding campaign - we need to hit a minimum of 100 sales to confirm the print run. If we don't hit that target, there won't be any shirts! It also means that there's a time limit - you need to place your order by <strong>May 12</strong>. If you don't place an order before then, you'll miss out!</p>
<p>So - <a class="reference external" href="https://fabrily.com/django18">place your orders</a>, and spread the word!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Added a note about VAT for UK and European purchases.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 29 April:</strong> we've hit 100 sales, so the print run is happening! Get your order in by May 12th, and you'll get a shirt or hoodie.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 1 May:</strong> Modified the shirt descriptions to remove gender specificity.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 13 May:</strong> The campaign has now closed, raising almost $6500 for the Django Software Foundation. Thanks to everyone who contributed!.</p>
