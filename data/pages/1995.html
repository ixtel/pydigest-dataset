<p>Wheels <em>used</em> to include pre-generated console script wrappers in the package, but this was sub-optimal and the files were removed. The installer is supposed to generate these wrapper scripts instead, but <code>pip</code> has not yet been updated to follow suit, see <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1067" rel="nofollow">issue 1067</a>.</p>

<p>Until <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/1251" rel="nofollow">pull request 1251</a> is part of a release, you'll have to use a separate command to install console scripts:</p>

<pre><code>python -m wheel install-scripts thing.whl
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#setuptools-scripts-handling" rel="nofollow"><em>Setuptools scripts handling</em></a> in the Wheel documentation.</p>

<p>The pull request was merged earlier this month (November 2014), and will be part of the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/milestones" rel="nofollow">upcoming 6.0 release</a>. You could also use <code>pip</code> to upgrade itself to the development version from GitHub with:</p>

<pre><code>pip install git+https://github.com/pypa/pip.git
</code></pre>
