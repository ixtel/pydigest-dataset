<html><body><div><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p> Here's a list of the local Python groups that I know about. (Note: our Berkeley meetups are listed on our <a href="/events">events page</a>.)</p>
<h3>Towards South Bay:</h3>
<h3>San Francisco:</h3>
<h3>East Bay:</h3>
<p>(and probably more, if you search Meetup.com for "Python")</p>
<p>If I missed any local Python groups, leave a comment below and I'll update the lists.</p>
<h2>Managing Information Overload</h2>
<p>I'm actually a member of over 600 groups on Meetup.com. I filter the notification messages into a "MEETUP" folder. An email filter stars any messages that contain words like "Python" and other topics that I'm interested in. This actually works for any kind of meetup. I probably get about 100 emails per day from Meetup.com, but the stars next to interesting events let me skim the list quickly and delete the rest.</p>
<p>Gmail allows one to add "labels" to messages based on things like email address. I also have Thunderbird add stars based on keywords like Python, JavaScript, and Vim:</p>
