						<p>Today we’re glad to let you know that the <strong>third PyCharm 4 EAP build 139.354</strong> is ready for your evaluation. Please <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+%28EAP%29">download</a> it from our <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+%28EAP%29">EAP page</a>.</p>
<p>Just as always, this EAP build can be used for 30 days after its release date and it doesn’t require any license.</p>
<p>Comparing to the previous EAP builds, this one mostly includes a consolidation of fixes for various bugs and problems, and improvements for recently added features. For the detailed list of notable changes and improvements, please check the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/PyCharm+139.354+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>The most notable brand-new feature in this build is the <strong>NumPy array viewer</strong> which is available from the debugger and the integrated Python console:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2014/11/numpyarrays.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2827" alt="numpyarrays" src="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2014/11/numpyarrays.png"/></a></p>
<p>To view a NumPy array, run your project in a debug mode and find the NumPy array in the variables list shown in the PyCharm`s graphical debugger. Right-click it and select <em>“View as Array”</em>.</p>
<p>To follow the scientific mood of this PyCharm 4 EAP build, we also added the <strong>support for matplotlib</strong> in the integrated python console.</p>
<p>This build also brings a lot of improvements to the recently announced <strong>IPython Notebook integration</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2014/10/ipynb2.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2801" alt="ipynb2" src="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2014/10/ipynb2.png"/></a></p>
<p>PyCharm now works better with cells of different types. We’ve fixed issues with cell rendering and some bugs related to wrong PyCharm behavior inside <em>ipynb cells</em>. Now PyCharm starts the IPython notebook automatically when running a <em>ipynb file</em> or separate cells in it.<br/>
When working with IPython notebook files, PyCharm now provides well-known shortcuts: for example you can press <em>Shift+Enter</em> to run a cell or <em>Ctrl+Shift+Down</em> to move a cell down. See the list of IPython notebook shortcuts <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/1/interactive/notebook.html">here</a> and try them in PyCharm.<br/>
The full list of IPython notebook improvements can be found in our <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues?q=project%3A+pycharm+resolved+date%3A+2014-10-17+..+2014-11-06+%23%7BIPython+Notebook%7D+">issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>The new “<a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2014/10/second-pycharm-4-eap-ipython-notebook-attach-to-process-and-more/">Attach to process</a>” feature introduced with the previous build is now available under the Mac OS platform!</p>
