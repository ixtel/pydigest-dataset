  <h1 class="page-title">Natural Language Basics with TextBlob</h1>
  <p>by <a href="http://www.decontextualize.com">Allison Parrish</a></p>

<p>In this chapter, we’ll use a Python library called <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/">TextBlob</a> to perform simple natural language processing tasks.</p>

<p>“Natural Language Processing” is a field at the intersection of computer
science, linguistics and artificial intelligence which aims to make the
underlying structure of language available to computer programs for analysis
and manipulation. It’s a vast and vibrant field with a long history! New
research and techniques are being developed constantly.</p>

<p>The aim of this chapter is to introduce a few simple concepts and techniques
from NLP—just the stuff that’ll help you do creative things quickly, and
maybe open the door for you to understand more sophisticated NLP concepts that
you might encounter elsewhere.</p>

<p>The most commonly known library for doing NLP in Python is <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>. NLTK is a fantastic library, but it’s also a writhing behemoth: large
and slippery and difficult to understand. TextBlob is a simpler, more humane
interface to much of NLTK’s functionality: perfect for NLP beginners or poets
that just want to get work done.</p>

<h2 id="natural-language">Natural language</h2>

<p>“Natural language” is a loaded phrase: what makes one stretch of language
“natural” while another stretch is not? NLP techniques are opinionated about
what language is and how it works; as a consequence, you’ll sometimes find
yourself having to conceptualize your text with uncomfortable abstractions in
order to make it work with NLP. (This is especially true of poetry, which
almost by definition breaks most “conventional” definitions of how language
behaves and how it’s structured.)</p>

<p>Of course, a computer can never really fully “understand” human language.<br/>
Even when the text you’re using fits the abstractions of NLP perfectly, the
results of NLP analysis are always going to be at least a little bit
inaccurate. But often even inaccurate results can be “good enough”—and in any
case, inaccurate output from NLP procedures can be an excellent source of the
sublime and absurd juxtapositions that we (as poets) are constantly in search
of.</p>

<h3 id="the-english-speakers-only-club">The English Speakers Only Club</h3>

<p>The main assumption that most NLP libraries and techniques make is that the
text you want to process will be in English. Historically, most NLP research
has been on English specifically; it’s only more recently that serious work
has gone into applying these techniques to other languages. The examples in
this chapter are all based on English texts, and the tools we’ll use are
geared toward English. If you’re interested in working on NLP in other
languages, here are a few starting points:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/konlpy/konlpy">Konlpy</a>, natural language processing in
Python for Korean</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba">Jieba</a>, text segmentation and POS tagging in
Python for Chinese</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern">Pattern</a> library (like TextBlob, a
simplified/augmented interface to NLTK) includes POS-tagging and some
morphology for Spanish in its
<a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-es">pattern.es</a> package.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="english-grammar-a-crash-course">English grammar: a crash course</h2>

<p>The only thing I believe about English grammar is <a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/creeley-on-sentence.html">this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh yes, the sentence,” Creeley once told the critic Burton Hatlen, “that’s
what we call it when we put someone in jail.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no such thing as a sentence, or a phrase, or a part of speech, or even
a “word”—these are all pareidolic fantasies occasioned by glints of sunlight
we see on reflected on the surface of the ocean of language; fantasies that we
comfort ourselves with when faced with language’s infinite and unknowable
variability.</p>

<p>Regardless, we may find it occasionally helpful to think about language using
these abstractions. The following is a gross oversimplification of both how
English grammar works, and how theories of English grammar work in the context
of NLP. But it should be enough to get us going!</p>

<h3 id="sentences-and-parts-of-speech">Sentences and parts of speech</h3>

<p>English texts can roughly be divided into “sentences.” Sentences are themselves
composed of individual words, each of which has a function in expressing the
meaning of the sentence. The function of a word in a sentence is called its
“part of speech”—i.e., a word functions as a noun, a verb, an adjective, etc.
Here’s a sentence, with words marked for their part of speech:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I</td>
      <td>really</td>
      <td>love</td>
      <td>entrees</td>
      <td>from</td>
      <td>the</td>
      <td>new</td>
      <td>cafeteria.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>pronoun</td>
      <td>adverb</td>
      <td>verb</td>
      <td>noun (plural)</td>
      <td>preposition</td>
      <td>determiner</td>
      <td>adjective</td>
      <td>noun</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Of course, the “part of speech” of a word isn’t a property of the word itself.
We know this because a single “word” can function as two different parts of speech:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love cheese.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word “love” here is a verb. But here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Love is a battlefield.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>… it’s a noun. For this reason (and others), it’s difficult for computers to
accurately determine the part of speech for a word in a sentence. (It’s
difficult sometimes even for humans to do this.) But NLP procedures do their
best!</p>

<h3 id="phrases">Phrases</h3>

<p>A sentence can be divided into groups of words that work as units, or “phrases.” Phrases themselves might have smaller phrases within them, forming a tree structure. Linguists traditionally draw the structure of a sentence out in an actual tree:</p>

<p><img src="../public/cafeteriatree.png" alt="Cafeteria tree"/></p>

<p>A declarative sentence consists of a noun phrase (the subject) and a verb
phrase (the predicate). The verb phrase has a verb, followed (optionally, if
the verb is transitive) by a noun phrase. A “noun phrase” is basically the
noun, plus all of the stuff that surrounds and modifies the noun, like
adjectives, relative clauses, prepositional phrases, etc. Noun phrases are
handy things to be able to detect and extract, since they give us an idea of
what a text might be “about.”</p>

<p>NLP libraries give us tools to parse sentences into trees like this, and
extract phrases from the sentence according to what kind of phrase it is.
Notably, TextBlob makes extracting noun phrases super easy.</p>

<p>But note: if computers are bad at identifying parts of speech, they’re even
<em>worse</em> at parsing grammar in sentences. You will get some wonky results, so be
prepared.</p>

<h3 id="morphology">Morphology</h3>

<p>“Morphology” is the word that linguists use to describe all of the weird ways
that individual words get modified to change their meaning, usually with
prefixes and suffixes. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>do -&gt; redo
sing -&gt; singing
monarch -&gt; monarchy
teach -&gt; taught
</code></pre>

<p>A word’s “lemma” is its most “basic” form, the form without any morphology
applied to it. “Sing,” “sang,” “singing,” are all different “forms” of the
lemma <em>sing</em>. Likewise, “octopi” is the plural of “octopus”; the “lemma” of
“octopi” is <em>octopus</em>.</p>

<p>“Lemmatizing” a text is the process of going through the text and replacing
each word with its lemma. This is often done in an attempt to reduce a text
to its most “essential” meaning, by eliminating pesky things like verb tense
and noun number.</p>

<h3 id="pluralization">Pluralization</h3>

<p>There’s one super important kind of morphology, and that’s the rules for taking
a singular noun and turning it into a plural noun, like:</p>

<pre><code>cat -&gt; cats (easy)
cheese -&gt; cheeses (also easy...)
knife -&gt; knives (complicated)
child -&gt; children (huh?)
</code></pre>

<p>Even though we as humans employ plural morphology in pretty much every
sentence, without a second thought, the rules for how to do it are actually
really weird and complicated (as with all elements of human language). A
computer is never going to be able to 100% accurately make this transformation.
But, again, some NLP libraries try. </p>

<h2 id="using-textblob">Using TextBlob</h2>

<p>At this point, let’s actually start using TextBlob so we can put this boring
theory into practice.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>To use textblob, we of course need to install it! And to install it, we need to
create or activate a virtualenv.</p>

<pre><code>$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>

<p>Then, install TextBlob with <code>pip</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install textblob
</code></pre>

<p>Wait as things happen. When it’s all done, you might need to download the
TextBlob corpora; to do so, type the following on the command line:</p>

<pre><code>$ python -m textblob.download_corpora
</code></pre>

<h2 id="sentences-words-and-noun-phrases">Sentences, words and noun phrases</h2>

<p>Let’s play with TextBlob in the interactive interpreter. The basic steps for
using TextBlob are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a TextBlob object, passing a string with the text we want to work with.</li>
  <li>Use various methods and attributes of the resulting object to get at various parts of the text.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, here’s how to get a list of sentences from a string:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import TextBlob
&gt;&gt;&gt; blob = TextBlob("ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts. Perhaps the best way to describe us is as a Center for the Recently Possible.")
&gt;&gt;&gt; for sentence in blob.sentences:
...     print sentence
ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts.
Perhaps the best way to describe us is as a Center for the Recently Possible.
</pre>

<p>The <code>.sentences</code> attribute of the resulting object is a list of sentences in the text. (Much easier than trying to split on punctuation, right?)</p>

<p>Each sentence object also has an attribute <code>.words</code> that has a list of words in
that sentence.</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import TextBlob
&gt;&gt;&gt; blob = TextBlob("ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts. Perhaps the best way to describe us is as a Center for the Recently Possible.")
&gt;&gt;&gt; for word in blob.sentences[1].words:
...     print word
Perhaps
the
best
way
to
describe
us
is
as
a
Center
for
the
Recently
Possible
</pre>

<p>The TextBlob object also has a “.noun_phrases” attribute that simply returns the text of all noun phrases found in the original text:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import TextBlob
&gt;&gt;&gt; blob = TextBlob("ITP is a two-year graduate program located in the Tisch School of the Arts. Perhaps the best way to describe us is as a Center for the Recently Possible.")
&gt;&gt;&gt; for np in blob.noun_phrases:
...     print np
itp
two-year graduate program
tisch
recently
</pre>

<p>(As you can see, this isn’t terribly accurate, but we’re working with computers
here. What are you going to do.)</p>

<h3 id="tagging-parts-of-speech">“Tagging” parts of speech</h3>

<p>TextBlob can also tell us what part of speech each word in a text corresponds
to. It can tell us if a word in a sentence is functioning as a noun, an
adjective, a verb, etc. In NLP, associating a word with a part of speech is
called “tagging.” Correspondingly, the attribute of the <code>TextBlob</code> object
we’ll use to access this information is <code>.tags</code>.</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import TextBlob
&gt;&gt;&gt; blob = TextBlob("I have a lovely bunch of coconuts.")
&gt;&gt;&gt; for word, pos in blob.tags:
...    print word, pos
I PRP
have VBP
a DT
lovely JJ
bunch NN
of IN
coconuts NNS
</pre>

<p>This <code>for</code> loop is a little weird, because it has <em>two</em> temporary loop
variables instead of one. (The underlying reason for this is that <code>.tags</code>
evaluates to a list of two-item tuples, which we can automatically unpack
by specifying two items in the for loop. Don’t worry about this if it doesn’t
make sense. Just know that when we’re using the <code>.tags</code> attribute, you need
two loop variables instead of one.) The first variable, which we’ve called
<code>word</code> here, contains the word; the second variable, called <code>pos</code> here,
contains the part of speech.</p>

<p>Here’s a brief list of what the tags mean. You can see a more complete list of POS tag meanings <a href="http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/mbsp-tags">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NN: noun</li>
  <li>JJ: adjective</li>
  <li>IN: preposition</li>
  <li>VB_: verb (the <code>_</code> gets replaced with various letters depending on the form of the verb)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pluralization-1">Pluralization</h3>

<p>The TextBlob library comes with a built-in kind of object called <code>Word</code>. If
you create a <code>Word</code> object, you can use its <code>.pluralize()</code> method to get the
plural form of that word:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import Word
&gt;&gt;&gt; w = Word("university")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print w.pluralize()
universities
</pre>

<p><code>Word</code> objects also have a <code>.lemmatize()</code> method, which returns the word, but with all morphology (suffixes, etc.) removed.</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import Word
&gt;&gt;&gt; w = Word("running")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print w.lemmatize()
running
</pre>

<p>All items in the <code>.words</code> and <code>.tags</code> attribute of a sentence are also secretly
<code>Word</code> objects, so you can call the <code>.pluralize()</code> method on those items when
(e.g.) looping through a list:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import TextBlob
&gt;&gt;&gt; blob = TextBlob("I spy a lion, a tiger, and a bear.")
&gt;&gt;&gt; sentence = blob.sentences[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for word, pos in sentence.tags:
...   if pos == 'NN':
...     print word.pluralize()
spies
lions
tigers
</pre>

<h2 id="some-examples">Some examples</h2>

<h3 id="print-only-short-sentences">Print only short sentences</h3>

<p>This example takes an arbitrary input text and parses it into sentences. It
then prints out ten random sentences from the text that have five or fewer
words.</p>

<pre>
from textblob import TextBlob
import random
import sys

# stdin's read() method just reads in all of standard input as a string;
# use the decode method to convert to ascii (textblob prefers ascii)
text = sys.stdin.read().decode('ascii', errors="replace")
blob = TextBlob(text)

short_sentences = list()
for sentence in blob.sentences:
  if len(sentence.words) &lt;= 5:
    short_sentences.append(sentence.replace("\n", " "))

for item in random.sample(short_sentences, 10):
	print item
</pre>
<p>Program: hemingwayize.py</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like when using <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> as input:</p>

<pre>$ python hemingwayize.py &lt; austen.txt
"No, not at all."
"Oh!
"Ten thousand pounds!
.
said Frank Churchill.
impossible!"
'Lord!'
But the effort was painful.
But what shall I say?
Let Wickham be _your_ man.
</pre>

<h4 id="dealing-with-unicode-errors">Dealing with Unicode errors</h4>

<p>Wait, what’s all that <code>decode('ascii', errors="replace")</code> business there?
It turns out that TextBlob is really finicky about text: if it gets anything
except plain ASCII text, it has a propensity to return strange errors. The
<code>decode</code> method can be called on any string; you can use it to remove any
non-ASCII characters from a string, making it safe for TextBlob. Use <code>replace</code>
to replace non-ASCII characters with a placeholder, or <code>ignore</code> to remove them
entirely. For example:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; string_with_stuff = "weird \xe1ccents"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print string_with_stuff.decode('ascii', errors="ignore")
weird ccents
</pre>

<h3 id="turn-any-text-into-a-list-of-instructions">Turn any text into a list of instructions</h3>

<p>This program extracts all noun phrases from a text, and all verbs; it then
randomly selects from these lists to generate dada instructions from the text.</p>

<pre>
from textblob import TextBlob
import sys
import random

text = sys.stdin.read().decode('ascii', errors="replace")
blob = TextBlob(text)

noun_phrases = blob.noun_phrases

verbs = list()
for word, tag in blob.tags:
  if tag == 'VB':
    verbs.append(word.lemmatize())

for i in range(1, 11):
  print "Step " + str(i) + ". " + random.choice(verbs).title() + " " + \
      random.choice(noun_phrases)
</pre>
<p>Program: instructify.py</p>

<p>Using some H. P. Lovecraft as input:</p>

<pre>$ python instructify.py &lt; lovecraft.txt
Step 1. Sail thick forests
Step 2. Come new yearnings
Step 3. Lessen long grass
Step 4. Buy books men
Step 5. Come kuranes
Step 6. Prove new name
Step 7. Exist ship
Step 8. Sail celephais
Step 9. Remember white summit
Step 10. Be old world
</pre>

<h3 id="create-a-summary-of-a-text">Create a “summary” of a text</h3>

<p>This program “summarizes” a text in a very basic way. It does so by examining
the part of speech of each word, and appending the word to a list if the word
is a noun; it then prints out five random nouns from the text in plural form.</p>

<pre>
from textblob import TextBlob, Word
import sys
import random

text = sys.stdin.read().decode('ascii', errors="ignore")
blob = TextBlob(text)

nouns = list()
for word, tag in blob.tags:
	if tag == 'NN':
		nouns.append(word.lemmatize())

print "This text is about..."
for item in random.sample(nouns, 5):
	word = Word(item)
	print word.pluralize()
</pre>
<p>Program: summarize_nouns.py</p>

<p>Using Lovecraft as input, once again:</p>

<pre>$ python summarize_nouns.py &lt; lovecraft.txt
This text is about...
men
worlds
seas
flows
autumns
</pre>

<h2 id="wordnet">Wordnet</h2>

<p>TextBlob also provides an interface to WordNet data. <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> is basically a computer-readable thesaurus. <a href="http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn">You can use it online
here</a>.</p>

<p>Wordnet’s most basic unit is the <em>synset</em>. A synset is essentially a “group” of
different words that all mean the “same” thing. For example, wordnet might
group “kitty,” “cat,” “feline,” etc. into a synset, categorized under the
abstract concept of <em>CAT</em>.</p>

<p>You can get a list of synsets that wordnet thinks a word belongs to like so:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import Word
&gt;&gt;&gt; bank = Word("bank")
&gt;&gt;&gt; synsets = bank.synsets
&gt;&gt;&gt; print synsets
[Synset('bank.n.01'), Synset('depository_financial_institution.n.01'), Synset('bank.n.03'), Synset('bank.n.04'), Synset('bank.n.05'), Synset('bank.n.06'), Synset('bank.n.07'), Synset('savings_bank.n.02'), Synset('bank.n.09'), Synset('bank.n.10'), Synset('bank.v.01'), Synset('bank.v.02'), Synset('bank.v.03'), Synset('bank.v.04'), Synset('bank.v.05'), Synset('deposit.v.02'), Synset('bank.v.07'), Synset('trust.v.01')]
</pre>

<p>As you can see, the word “bank” belongs to many different synsets! We can print
out WordNet’s definition for a synset like so:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import Word
&gt;&gt;&gt; synsets = Word("bank").synsets
&gt;&gt;&gt; for synset in synsets:
...   print synset.definition()
sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)
a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities
a long ridge or pile
an arrangement of similar objects in a row or in tiers
a supply or stock held in reserve for future use (especially in emergencies)
the funds held by a gambling house or the dealer in some gambling games
a slope in the turn of a road or track; the outside is higher than the inside in order to reduce the effects of centrifugal force
a container (usually with a slot in the top) for keeping money at home
a building in which the business of banking transacted
a flight maneuver; aircraft tips laterally about its longitudinal axis (especially in turning)
tip laterally
enclose with a bank
do business with a bank or keep an account at a bank
act as the banker in a game or in gambling
be in the banking business
put into a bank account
cover with ashes so to control the rate of burning
have confidence or faith in
</pre>

<p>You can restrict which synsets to retrieve for a word for that word only when
used as a particular part of speech (say noun or verb).</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import Word
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob.wordnet import NOUN
&gt;&gt;&gt; synsets = Word("bank").get_synsets(pos=NOUN)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for synset in synsets:
...   print synset.definition()
sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)
a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities
a long ridge or pile
an arrangement of similar objects in a row or in tiers
a supply or stock held in reserve for future use (especially in emergencies)
the funds held by a gambling house or the dealer in some gambling games
a slope in the turn of a road or track; the outside is higher than the inside in order to reduce the effects of centrifugal force
a container (usually with a slot in the top) for keeping money at home
a building in which the business of banking transacted
a flight maneuver; aircraft tips laterally about its longitudinal axis (especially in turning)
</pre>

<p>We can also take any synset and use its <code>.lemma_names()</code> method to get all of
the words belonging to the synset, essentially giving us a list of synonyms
(words that mean the same thing). Let’s find synonyms for “bank” in the sense
of “financial institutions” (element 1 from the list above):</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob import Word
&gt;&gt;&gt; from textblob.wordnet import NOUN
&gt;&gt;&gt; synsets = Word("bank").get_synsets(pos=NOUN)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print synsets[1].lemma_names()
[u'depository_financial_institution', u'bank', u'banking_concern', u'banking_company']
</pre>

<p>Thanks, WordNet!</p>

<h3 id="example-synonymize">Example: Synonymize</h3>

<p>This program reads in a ext, parses it into words, and then replaces each 
word with a random synonym (according to WordNet). Only words with three
or more letters that have synonyms in WordNet are replaced.</p>

<pre>
from textblob import Word
import sys
import random

for line in sys.stdin:
  line = line.strip()
  line = line.decode('ascii', errors="replace")
  words = line.split(" ")
  output = list()
  for word_str in words:
    word_obj = Word(word_str)
    if len(word_str) &gt; 3 and len(word_obj.synsets) &gt; 0:
      random_synset = random.choice(word_obj.synsets)
      random_lemma = random.choice(random_synset.lemma_names)
      output.append(random_lemma.replace('_', ' '))
    else:
      output.append(word_str)
  print " ".join(output)
