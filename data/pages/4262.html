<p>SQLAlchemy release 1.0.1 is now available.</p>
<p>This is a quick bug-fix release that repairs several new regressions
identified in the 1.0.0 release, not found during the beta period.
All users of 1.0.0 are encouraged to upgrade to 1.0.1.</p>
<p>Key elements of this release include fixes regarding the <tt class="docutils literal">NEVER_SET</tt>
symbol leaking into queries in some cases, fixes to SQLite
when  using DDL in conjunction with referential integrity enabled, a
fix to the EXISTS construct which primarily impacts queries that use
special datatypes, and repairs to the Firebird dialect regarding the
new LIMIT/OFFSET features.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate some of these fixes, there are three additional
behavioral changes in 1.0.1; a new warning is emitted when using DDL with SQLite
in conjunction with mutually-dependent foreign keys (e.g. a reference cycle),
a new warning is emitted when running ORM relationship comparisons when
the target object contains the value <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> for any of the Python-side column
values, and a change is made regarding which data values are used within a
relationship comparison that uses the <tt class="docutils literal">!=</tt> operator, in order to make the
behavior consistent with that of the <tt class="docutils literal">==</tt> operator as used in the same
context.   The migration notes contains updates for all three of these
changes, and they are each linked directly from the changelog which should
be carefully reviewed.</p>
