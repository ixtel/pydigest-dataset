<p>There are tons of Python packages out there. So many that no one man or woman
could possibly catch them all. <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a> alone has over 47,000 packages listed!</p>
<p>Recently, with so many data scientists making the switch to Python,
I couldn't help but think that while they're getting some of the great benefits of
<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, they're missing out on some older
yet equally helpful Python libraries.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to highlight some lesser-known libraries. Even you experienced 
Pythonistas should take a look, there might be one or two in there you've never seen!</p>

<p><a href="http://delorean.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Delorean</a> is a really cool date/time library. 
Apart from having a sweet name, it's one of the more natural feeling date/time 
munging libraries I've used in Python. It's sort of like <a href="http://momentjs.com/"><code>moment</code></a> in javascript,
except I laugh every time I import it. The docs are also good and in 
addition to being technically helpful, they also make countless <em>Back to the Future</em>
references.</p>
<pre><code>from delorean import Delorean
EST = "US/Eastern"
d = Delorean(timezone=EST)
</code></pre>

<p>There's a chance you haven't heard of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/prettytable/"><code>prettytable</code></a> because
it's listed on GoogleCode, which is basically the coding equivalent of Siberia. </p>
<p>Despite being exiled to a cold, snowy and desolate place, <code>prettytable</code> is great for
constructing output that looks good in the terminal or in the browser. So 
if you're working on a new plug-in for the IPython Notebook, check out 
<code>prettytable</code> for your HTML <code>__repr__</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from prettytable import PrettyTable
table = PrettyTable(["animal", "ferocity"])
table.add_row(["wolverine", 100])
table.add_row(["grizzly", 87])
table.add_row(["Rabbit of Caerbannog", 110])
table.add_row(["cat", -1])
table.add_row(["platypus", 23])
table.add_row(["dolphin", 63])
table.add_row(["albatross", 44])
table.sort_key("ferocity")
table.reversesort = True
+----------------------+----------+
|        animal        | ferocity |
+----------------------+----------+
| Rabbit of Caerbannog |   110    |
|      wolverine       |   100    |
|       grizzly        |    87    |
|       dolphin        |    63    |
|      albatross       |    44    |
|       platypus       |    23    |
|         cat          |    -1    |

<p>Ok so the first time I installed <code>snowballstemmer</code>, it was because I thought the 
name was cool. But it's actually a pretty slick little library. 
<code>snowballstemmer</code> will stem words in 15 different languages and also comes with 
a porter stemmer to boot.</p>
<pre><code>from snowballstemmer import EnglishStemmer, SpanishStemmer
EnglishStemmer().stemWord("Gregory")
# Gregori
SpanishStemmer().stemWord("amarillo")
# amarill
</code></pre>

<p>Remember every time you wrote that web crawler for some specific purpose? Turns 
out somebody built it...and it's called <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html"><code>wget</code></a>. Recursively download a 
website? Grab every image from a page? Sidestep cookie traces? Done, done, and 
done.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network">Movie Mark Zuckerberg</a> even says it himself</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First up is Kirkland, they keep everything open and allow indexes on their 
apache configuration, so a little <strong>wget magic</strong> is enough to download the 
entire Kirkland facebook. Kid stuff!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../static/img/movie-zuck.jpg"/></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wget">Python version</a> comes with just about 
every feature you could ask for and is easy to use.</p>
<pre><code>import wget
wget.download("http://www.cnn.com/")
# 100% [............................................................................] 280385 / 280385
</code></pre>
<p>Note that another option for linux and osx users would be to use do: 
<code>from sh import wget</code>. However the Python wget module does have a better argument
handline.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how <code>PyMC</code> gets left out of the mix so often. <code>scikit-learn</code> seems 
to be everyone's darling (as it should, it's <em>fantastic</em>), but in my opinion, 
not enough love is given to <code>PyMC</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from pymc.examples import disaster_model
from pymc import MCMC
M = MCMC(disaster_model)
M.sample(iter=10000, burn=1000, thin=10)
[-----------------100%-----------------] 10000 of 10000 complete in 1.4 sec
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't already know it, <code>PyMC</code> is a library for doing Bayesian analysis. 
It's featured heavily in Cam Davidson-Pilon's <a href="http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/">Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a>
and has made cameos on a lot of popular data science/python blogs, but has never
received the cult following akin to <code>scikit-learn</code>.</p>

<p>I can't risk you leaving this page and <em>not knowing about <code>sh</code></em>. <code>sh</code> lets you 
import shell commands into Python as functions. It's super useful for doing 
things that are easy in bash but you can't remember how to do in Python (i.e. 
recursively searching for files).</p>
<pre><code>from sh import find
find("/tmp")
/tmp/foo
/tmp/foo/file1.json
/tmp/foo/file2.json
/tmp/foo/file3.json
/tmp/foo/bar/file3.json
</code></pre>

<p>Ranking in the top 10 of simplest libraries I've ever used (if you have 2-3 minutes, you 
can <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy/blob/master/fuzzywuzzy/fuzz.py">read through the source</a>), <code>fuzzywuzzy</code> is a 
fuzzy string matching library built by the fine people at <a href="https://seatgeek.com/">SeatGeek</a>.</p>
<p><code>fuzzywuzzy</code> implements things like string comparison ratios, token ratios, and 
plenty of other matching metrics. It's great for creating feature vectors or 
matching up records in different databases.</p>
<pre><code>from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
fuzz.ratio("Hit me with your best shot", "Hit me with your pet shark")
# 85
</code></pre>

<p>You know those scripts you have where you do a <code>print "still going..."</code> in that 
giant mess of a for loop you call your <code>__main__</code>? Yeah well instead of doing 
that, why don't you step up your game and start using <code>progressbar</code>?</p>
<p><code>progressbar</code> does pretty much exactly what you think it does...makes progress 
bars. And while this isn't exactly a data science specific activity, it does
put a nice touch on those extra long running scripts.</p>
<p>Alas, as another GoogleCode outcast, it's not getting much love (<strong>the docs have 
2 spaces for indents...2!!!</strong>). Do what's right and give it a good ole <code>pip install</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from progressbar import ProgressBar
import time
pbar = ProgressBar(maxval=10)
for i in range(1, 11):
    pbar.update(i)
    time.sleep(1)
pbar.finish()
# 60% |########################################################                                      |
</code></pre>

<p>So while you're making your logs have nice progress bars, why not also make 
them colorful! It can actually be helpful for reminding yourself when things are
going horribly wrong.</p>
<p><code>colorama</code> is super easy to use. Just pop it into your scripts and add any text
you want to print to a color:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../static/img/colorama-red.png"/></p>

<p>I'm of the mind that there are really only a few tools one needs in programming:
hashing, key/value stores, and universally unique ids. <code>uuid</code> is the built in 
Python UUID library. It implements versions 1, 3, 4, and 5 of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">UUID 
standards</a> and is 
really handy for doing things like...err...ensuring uniqueness. </p>
<p>That might sound silly, but how many times have you had records for a marketing 
campaign, or an e-mail drop and you want to make sure everyone gets their own
promo code or id number?</p>
<p>And if you're worried about running out of ids, then fear not! The number of UUIDs
you can generate is comparable <a href="http://wisdomofganesh.blogspot.com/2009/04/guidness-of-uuid.html">to the number of atoms in the universe</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import uuid
print uuid.uuid4()
# e7bafa3d-274e-4b0a-b9cc-d898957b4b61
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../static/img/alone-in-universe.jpg"/>
</p><center>Well if you were a <em>uuid</em> you probably would be.</center>

<p>Shameless self-promotion here, <code>bashplotlib</code> is one of my creations. It lets you
plot histograms and scatterplots using stdin. So while you might not find it 
replacing ggplot or matplotlib as your everyday plotting library, the novelty 
value is quite high. At the very least, use it as a way to spruce up your logs a
bit.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install bashplotlib
$ scatter --file data/texas.txt --pch x
</code></pre>
