<p><a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a> is the leading cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. Dealing with audio and video can eat up resources, making the activity a great fit for IronWorker by moving the heavy lifting to the background.</p>
<p>In the past, usage of FFmpeg with IronWorker would require that our users include and install the dependency within each worker environment. In order to streamline that process for developers, we’ve included FFmpeg in an IronWorker stack as a <a href="http://blog.iron.io/2014/03/ironio-launches-custom-runtime.html">custom runtime environment</a> specifically meant for video processing.<span id="more-5379"/></p>
<p>The possibilities are endless with the flexibility of FFmpeg and the processing power of IronWorker. Here are a few examples we’ve come across in working with our users, which will give you a baseline for the capabilities.</p>

<li>Format Encoding</li>
<li>Audio Normalization</li>
<li>Audio/Video Optimization</li>
<li>Metadata Analysis</li>
<li>DRM Encoding/Decoding</li>
<li>Screencapture Production</li>
<li>Resize, Reformat and Crop Video</li>
<li>Change Aspect Ratio</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.avi</code></pre>
<h4>Specifications:</h4>
<p>pre-built libraries: <i>ffmpeg-2.3, GPAC-0.5.1, , x264-0.142.x</i><br/>
supported runtimes: <i>php-5.3, node-0.10, ruby-1.9.3p0, python-2.7</i><br/>
Find out more detailed info about the FFmpeg stack <a href="http://dev.iron.io/worker/reference/environment/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>To use, simply include “ffmpeg-2.3” in your .worker file using the stack option:</p>
<pre><code>stack "ffmpeg-2.3" </code></pre>
<p>Here are a few examples of how to use the FFmpeg stack in the supported languages.</p>
<h3>Using Ruby runtime + FFmpeg stack</h3>
<h3>Using Node.js runtime + FFmpeg stack</h3>
<h3>Using Python runtime + FFmpeg stack</h3>
<h3>Using PHP runtime + FFmpeg stack</h3><p><b><i>More flexibility for our developers</i></b><br/>
Making deployment and dependency management painless is a top priority for our team. Supporting a diverse range of languages, frameworks, and packages provides our users what they need to make their Iron.io implementation successful.</p>
