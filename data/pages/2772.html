<p>Today we are going to do a quick analysis on which programming languages are the most popular on Reddit.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this, but the easiest is to see the number of subscribers to each sub-reddit. Each subreddit has a subscribe button:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/subscribe_reddit.jpg" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1107"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1108" src="//i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/subscribe_reddit.jpg?resize=304%2C189" alt="subscribe_reddit" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/subscribe_reddit.jpg?resize=300%2C187 300w, http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/subscribe_reddit.jpg?w=304 304w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a>So I made a list of all the languages I knew (or could think of). I then removed any similarish ones (like Delphi and Pascal).</p>
<p>The next step is to find the subreddit of each. Some had more than one, in which case we use the one with more subscribers.</p>
<p>So without much further ado, here are the results.</p>
<h4>The least popular languages</h4>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/least_pop_lang.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1107"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1111" src="//i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/least_pop_lang.png?resize=747%2C558" alt="least_pop_lang" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/least_pop_lang.png?resize=300%2C224 300w, http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/least_pop_lang.png?w=800 800w" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>I put in brainfuck just to mess with you. The others results arent that surprising. Cobol, which I’m surprised even has a subreddit, Tcl which most of you won’t have heard of. Same with Delphi and Smalltalk. Visual Basic is the most popular in the least popular list, if that makes sense.</p>
<h4>The most popular programming languages</h4>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_lang.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1107"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1113" src="//i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_lang.png?resize=730%2C545" alt="most_pop_lang" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_lang.png?resize=300%2C224 300w, http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_lang.png?w=800 800w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a>The first thing you note is that Python towers above everything else. I don’t know if this is due to the fact Reddit was written in Python, or if Python really is such a popular language.</p>
<p>Javascript and Java come next, which isn’t really surprising. Lisp may be on the lower end, but it still has almost 10,000 subscribers (not to mention, there are separate sub-reddits for Common Lisp, Scheme etc). A surprise was that C isn’t there, but those of you unlucky to program in C (and that includes me) will know that C doesn’t have much in the way of  “activity”. It isn’t a hot language with new features, cool blogs and conferences.</p>
<p>Next, we look at the top 5 languages in the list above:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top5_lang.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1107"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1110" src="//i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top5_lang.png?resize=800%2C597" alt="top5_lang" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top5_lang.png?resize=300%2C224 300w, http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/top5_lang.png?w=800 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a>Python takes the pie again (haha, pun) with 36% share of the top 5 languages. Ruby is the smallest with 10%, but remember this is 10% of the top 5.</p>
<p>Now, Ruby is more popular as a web framework language (Rails), so next we’ll have a brief look at the top web frameworks.</p>
<p>This time, I didn’t spend too much time finding frameworks, choosing ten of the most popular ones (by which I mean, the ones most talked about):</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_frame.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1107"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1112" src="//i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_frame.png?resize=800%2C597" alt="most_pop_frame" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_frame.png?resize=300%2C224 300w, http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/most_pop_frame.png?w=800 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a>Rails is at the top here, which isn’t surprising. But Django is surprising, as from looking at<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails"> Rails on Stackoverflow</a>, it has twice as many questions as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/django">Django</a>. And yet, here they look equal.</p>
<p>A better method may be to compare the languages across multiple sources. That is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><em>1. This isn’t very scientific.</em></p>
<p>Of course it isn’t.</p>
<p><em>2. Can I see the source code?</em></p>
<p>Yes, you may. <a href="https://github.com/shantnu/reddit-top-langs">Here it is</a>.</p>
<p><em>3. You forgot My-Favourite-Language</em></p>
<p>If it changes the results above, let me know, and I’ll update the graphs.</p>
<p><em>4. Can I see the raw data?</em></p>
<p>The data for the languages is <a title="Reddit raw data" href="http://pythonforengineers.com/reddit-raw-data/">here</a>. For the frameworks, you’ll have to run the code.</p>
