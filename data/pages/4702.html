<html><body><div><div class="md"><p>Though I will be eventually plotting them, I would like to have the analytical solutions, for my own work, and my colleagues would want/need them for themselves.</p>

<p>I'm doing stuff with decays and leaching.</p>

<p>So, the simplest looks like, just a usual decay with a constant emanation as a source:</p>

<pre><code>N' = -λN + ε
</code></pre>

<p>Which feeds into the next, where the previous eqn is the source:</p>

<pre><code>n' = -μn + λN
</code></pre>

<p>Which then feeds into more terms, etc, etc, where we have sources from leaching and the previous decay products, and itself reducing via decay.</p>

<p>Think decay chain; Rn-222 -~-&gt; Pb-210 -&gt; Bi-210 -&gt; Po-210
each feeding the last with some extra sources.</p>

<pre><code>m' = -ρm +φm -μn
</code></pre>

<p>Basically getting something of the form:</p>

<pre><code>m = A exp(-ρt) + B t exp(-ρt) + C exp(-ρt)exp(-φt) + D exp(-μt) + E
</code></pre>

<p>or something like that, it's getting to the point where I am tired of solving them by hand, and am making too many mistakes that I thought sympy can help.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Some of them are quick, the more they start depending on eachother, the more terms it has to consider.</p>

<p>If I can somehow tell it to automatically things that are constants together and then substitute them after, would that speed it up, or does it do that anyway?</p>

<p>I can see there are 'hints' but I do not know enough about the different ways of solving differential equations to know which is best for this form.</p>
