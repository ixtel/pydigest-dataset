<h2>Time for a Django 1.8 release t-shirt!</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on March 7, 2015 </span>

<p>Last year, the Django Software Foundation organised a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/apr/10/getting-ready-django-17/">t-shirt to commemorate the release of Django 1.7</a>. Sales of that t-shirt raised almost $10,000 for the Django Software Foundation. Since this was so successful (and popular!), we've decided to do it again for Django 1.8!</p>
<p>The first thing we need is a shirt design.</p>
<p>If you're a graphic designer, and you can spare some time over the next month or so to develop a t-shirt design, please get in touch. We're willing to pay for your time - we can't promise we'll pay top-tier rates, but we're not asking for a completely volunteered effort, either (although we certainly won't turn away someone who <em>does</em> want to volunteer their time to the project). If you're interested, or you know someone who might be, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:foundation@djangoproject.com">send us some samples of your work</a>, and the DSF board will select a designer that we will work with to develop a final design.</p>
<p>If you've got an idea for what you think should be on the Django 1.8 release shirt, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:foundation@djangoproject.com">get in touch</a> - we'd love to hear your thoughts!</p>
<p>Once we've got a design organized, we'll let everyone know how they can place their orders for a 1.8 release shirt.</p>
