<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This library relies on the <a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html" rel="nofollow">boto3</a> library for S3 access, so you will need to
<a href="https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/configuration.html" rel="nofollow">configure your AWS credentials</a> first. Then, provide your S3 bucket name and
optional template directory name when instantiating the loader:</p>
<pre>#!python
from jinja2 import Environment
from jinja2_s3loader import S3loader

s3template_dir = "test/templates"  # trailing slash not required, but ok
j2 = Environment(loader=S3loader('my-s3-bucket-name', s3template_dir))
t = j2.get_template('mytemplate.j2')  # loads test/templates/mytemplate.j2
print(t.render({}))
</pre>
<p>Note that, although S3 does not have real directories and treats the prefix
string as purely a sub-string, this S3loader will treat the prefix as a
subdirectory. That is, it will add a trailing slash if none is provided.</p>
<p>Remember, accessing files over S3 costs money. The loader currently does not
support live reloading. I built this to support accessing S3 templates from AWS
Lambda functions, so those constraints are fine with me, but your use case may
be different.</p>
