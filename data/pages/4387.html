<p>I remember seeing my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/badnetworker">David's</a> <a href="http://davidmasad.com/blog/netlogo-from-python/">post</a> and <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dmasad/Py2NetLogo/blob/master/NetLogo%20Connection.ipynb">notebook</a> on using calling Java from Python using <a href="http://py4j.sourceforge.net/">py4j</a>. For the most part, Python is too slow for the simulations I build. And, the simulations are complex enough that writing them in C and binding them to Python would be error-prone. I want a high-level language that is fast enough; but, I want to explore it through <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a>. My high-level/fast-enough language of choice is Scala. Since <a href="https://github.com/mattpap/IScala">IScala</a> proved buggy (but promising!), I decided to follow David's lead.</p>
<p>After walking through his tutorial, I realized I didn't like py4j. There is too much friction in setting up gateways. So, I gave <a href="https://pyjnius.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">pyjnius</a> a try.</p>
<p>TLDR: <strong>Pyjnius is useful</strong>.</p>
