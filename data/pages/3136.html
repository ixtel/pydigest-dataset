Say for example I have some black text on white background then the subpixel rendering will make some adjacent pixels have some colors.</p><p>Take an example, Consolas, a font that works only with ClearType:</p><img alt="Consolas ClearType sample" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Consolas-cleartype.png"/><p>That just looks painful for my eyes, I see every colored pixel in something that should had been only black and white (or gray at least) - it's just friggin painful. If you don't notice it (well, I might see better than you) look here:</p><img alt="What's with all the colors?!" src="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2008/05/01/cleartype-is-for-color-blind-people/wtf-subpixel2.png"/><p>And I'm not just running on crap hardware - I think a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnet.com/products/dell-ultrasharp-2407wfp-hc-24-inch/">Dell 2407WPF-HC</a> is good enough!</p><p>I've also tried to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx">tune</a> the ClearType a bit and it still looks like crap.</p></div><p class="tags">This entry was tagged as <a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/tag/cleartype/"><span itemprop="keywords">cleartype</span></a><a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/tag/fonts/"><span itemprop="keywords">fonts</span></a><a href="https://blog.ionelmc.ro/tag/rant/"><span itemprop="keywords">rant</span></a></p></div><p id="disqus_thread"/><noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> </div></div></body></html>
