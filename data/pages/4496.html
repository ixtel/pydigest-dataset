I also used Python and matplotlib to run some descriptive statistics and visualize other aspects of my trip.</p>
<p>Here is the series of posts:</p>

<p>My Python code is available in <a href="https://github.com/gboeing/2014-summer-travels">this GitHub repo</a>. I also did some more involved work under the hood to prep the data and support these visualizations. For example, in the following posts I reverse-geocoded the spatial data set and reduced its size with clustering algorithms and the Douglas-Peucker algorithm:</p>

<p>This series serves as an introduction and tutorial for these various technologies and methods. It was a rewarding exercise to explore these different web mapping platforms, write a reverse-geocoder, and practice clustering and geometry simplification. Click the links through to the individual posts for full details and lots of visualizations.</p>
<h2>Interactive maps</h2>
<p>Here are some brief highlights. This interactive <a title="Visualizing Summer Travels Part 2: CartoDB" href="http://geoffboeing.com/2014/08/visualizing-summer-travels-with-cartodb/">CartoDB</a> map displays my location data set and provides city, country, and date/time information if you hover over any point:</p>
<p/>
<p>I also visualized this spatial data as an interactive map using the <a title="Visualizing Summer Travels Part 3: Leaflet" href="http://geoffboeing.com/2014/08/visualizing-summer-travels-part-3-leaflet/">Leaflet</a> javascript library, and by rolling my own set of web map tiles then rendering them with <a title="Visualizing Summer Travels Part 4: Mapbox + Tilemill" href="http://geoffboeing.com/2014/08/visualizing-summer-travels-part-4-mapbox-tilemill/">Tilemill and Mapbox</a>.</p>
<h2>Exploring the data set</h2>
<p>Beyond mapping my GPS location points, I also visualized other aspects of this data set. This <a title="Visualizing Summer Travels Part 5: Python + Matplotlib" href="http://geoffboeing.com/2014/08/visualizing-summer-travels-part-5-python-matplotlib/">matplotlib</a> pie chart breaks out the cities I visited, by their share of observations in the data set:</p>

<p>I also calculated the most isolated locations in my data set. These locations are spatially isolated from other data points either because I flew in/out of them, or because I didn’t have cell service to transmit location data anywhere else near them. This <a title="Visualizing Summer Travels Part 6: Projecting Spatial Data in Python" href="http://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/visualizing-summer-travels-part-6-projecting-spatial-data-python/">matplotlib</a> image plots a projected shapefile and my GPS location data to show these isolated clusters:</p>
