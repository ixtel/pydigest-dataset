<span><a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/21/pypy-the-jit-compiled-python-implementation" target="_blank">Episode #21: PyPy - The JIT Compiled Python Implementation</a></span><br/>
Is your Python code running a little slow? Did you know that the PyPy runtime could make it run up to 10x faster? Seriously! Maciej Fijalkowski is here to tell us all about it. This episode is all about the alternative, JIT compiled, garbage collection Python implementation PyPy. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://pbpython.com/creating-powerpoint.html" target="_blank">Creating Powerpoint Presentations with Python</a></span><br/>
Love it or loathe it, PowerPoint is widely used in most business settings. This article will not debate the merits of PowerPoint but will show you how to use python to remove some of the drudgery of PowerPoint by automating the creation of PowerPoint slides using python.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://pythontesting.net/podcast/what-to-expect-from-the-python-test-podcast-pt001/" target="_blank">What to expect from the Python Test Podcast (PT001)</a></span><br/>

<br/>
<span><a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/08/14/out-of-core-dataframes-in-python/" target="_blank">Out-of-Core Dataframes in Python: Dask and OpenStreetMap</a></span><br/>
This post takes a look at how dask can be useful when looking at a large dataset: the full extracted points of interest from OpenStreetMap. We will use Dask to manipulate and explore the data, and also see the use of matplotlib's Basemap toolkit to visualize the results on a map.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://invisibleroads.com/tutorials/xapian-search-pylons.html" target="_blank">Build a document search engine using Xapian and Pylons</a></span><br/>
It is now easy to set up a powerful search engine using open source libraries. In this tutorial, we will create a document search engine from scratch using Python bindings to a fast C++ search engine library called Xapian and deploy it using the Pylons web framework on the Python-friendly web hosting provider WebFaction.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://blog.dominodatalab.com/ab-testing-with-hierarchical-models-in-python/" target="_blank">A/B Testing with Hierarchical Models in Python</a></span><br/>
This post discusses a method for A/B testing using Beta-Binomial Hierarchical models to correct for a common pitfall when testing multiple hypotheses. It also compares it to the classical method of using Bernoulli models for p-value, and cover other advantages hierarchical models have over the classical model. <br/>

With this hands-on guide, you'll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its best--and possibly most neglected--features. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Python's core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time. Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.<br/>
