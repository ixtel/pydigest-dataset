<p>It's always a good idea to keep all unnecessary IP ports closed on a server. Indeed, there is a long <a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-336/product_id-575/Postgresql-Postgresql.html">list of them</a> for every vendor (and if there isn't, it's not because the vendor is secure...). The code below lets you expose your database instance using <a href="http://webpy.org">webpy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mfenniak/pg8000">pg8000</a>, so it will run anywhere, including Windows. If I get a chance to enhance this, I'll be putting a help endpoint to the application.</p>
