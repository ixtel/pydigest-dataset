            <p>The free, open source <a href="http://osf.io">Open Science Framework (OSF)</a> connects services across the entire research lifecycle to promote research efficiency and reproducibility.  For example, OSF is integrated with storage providers Box.com, Dropbox, Amazon S3, figshare, GitHub, Google Drive, and Dataverse, and citation management tools Zotero and Mendeley.  However, there are <strong>hundreds</strong> of tools and services that researchers use everyday to create and manage research protocols, collect and analyze data, author manuscripts, submit and review articles, track impact, and search and discover others research.  </p>
                    
            <p>Developers, we need <strong>you</strong> to help us connect all of these services!  The <a href="http://cos.io">Center for Open Science</a> supports and maintains the OSF and has grants available to connect OSF with the tools and services that researchers use.  See the list below for an ever-growing list of services that we have identified as a high-priority and ready for integration.  Complete our short proposal today for a grant to help us integrate them!  Donât see one that should be there?  Suggest it!
            </p>
        
            <p>Proposals should include the following information:
                <ls>
                    <li>Vitals of the individual or team that will do the work</li>
                    <li>Why this is the right team for the job</li>
                    <li>An assessment of the APIs for the selected tool(s)/service(s) and the <a href="https://staging2.osf.io/api/v2/docs/">v2 Open Science Framework API</a>, and how these would interact</li>
                    <li>Description of project plan and milestones over approximately 3 months development cycle</li>
                </ls>
            </p>
