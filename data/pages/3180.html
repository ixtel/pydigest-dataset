<html><body><div><div class="sqs-block-content"><p>I am pleased (and somewhat embarrassed) to release <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fedex/">python-fedex</a> 1.1.0!Pleased in that these changes have been patiently waiting for PyPi for a few
years now, embarrassed in that I’ve let the project sit since I stopped
using it more than five years ago. Let’s re-visit that after we talk
about the changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A quick <span class="caps">PEP8</span> pass on most of the codebase. Yucky. (gtaylor)</li>
<li>Changing recommended install method to use pip + PyPi. (radlws)</li>
<li>Updated rate_request and freight_rate_request examples for <span class="caps">WSDL</span> v16
compatibility. (foxxyz)</li>
<li>Updated rate service <span class="caps">WSDL</span> from v8 to v16. (foxxyz)</li>
<li>Added a freight rate request example (mwcbrent)</li>
<li>Bump ShipService <span class="caps">WSDL</span> to v13. (mwcbrent)</li>
<li>Update rate example to show multiple ServiceTypes. (danielatdattrixdotcom)</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone who actively uses python-fedex would like to take over
maintainership of the project, please get in touch. I have a super hard time
getting psyched up about playing with these FedEx <span class="caps">SOAP</span> services for funzies.</p>
<p>A few of the things that need doing, which my younger self skimped on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The module is in bad need of unit and integration tests. The FedEx WSDLs
change periodically, and it’s not always in a backwards-compatible manner.
The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gtaylor/python-fedex/tree/master/examples">examples</a> we already have would be a good starting point.</li>
<li>The label certification stuff should be cleaned up and checked over. The
process still exists, but it may be different now.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of this sounds riveting (or you have other ideas of your own), please
let me know and we can figure something out.</p>
<p>For the rest of you, enjoy python-fedex 1.1.0, in “development” for two and a half years!</p></div></div></body></html>
