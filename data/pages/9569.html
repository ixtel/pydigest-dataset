<p>In this case, I suggest using remote debugging. You can then have the process running as whichever user it needs to, and the IDE can run independently as another user, or even on another server.</p>

<p>Assuming you're using PyDev in LiClipse, you can configure remote debugging by following <a href="http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_remote_debugger.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation for remote debugging</a>.</p>

<p>The basic premise is that you add the <code>pydev</code> debugger library to your Python path and include the following where you need a breakpoint:</p>

<pre><code>import pydevd
pydevd.settrace('localhost', port=7788, stdoutToServer=True, stderrToServer=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Then you configure your IDE with a <code>pydev</code> instance listening at that server (<code>7788</code>) in this case.</p>

<p>If you want to use breakpoints from the IDE, you can add the argument <code>suspend=False</code>, and the debugger will not suspend until it encounters your breakpoints.</p>
