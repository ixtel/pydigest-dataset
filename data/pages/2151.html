<p>1) Make <code>north</code> <code>east</code> and <code>@property</code> decorated functions.  Allows for modifications to all dimensions after construction.</p>

<p>2) Make corners a <code>@property</code> wrapped function, and make it more readable and maintainable:</p>

<pre><code>@property
def corners(self):
    """Calculate the four corners of the Foo.
    """
    return {
        'north-east': (self.north, self.east),
        'north-west': (self.north, self.west),
        'south-east': (self.south, self.east),
        'south-west': (self.south, self.west),
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>product</code>, a list-comprehension, and a dict-comprehension to create a 4-item dictionary is overkill and makes me have to think about what the hell you're doing in that function when I happen upon your code 24 months after you're gone.</p>

<p>But I'm a grumpy old man who likes things obvious and simple.</p>
