<h4><strong>We are jumping on our feets right now!</strong></h4>
<p>We can’t find any other way to express our excitement. We said that 2015 is going to be a year when Analytics Vidhya will become <strong>the place to learn analytics and data science</strong>. We launched our discussion forums 2 weeks back and there are awesome discussions already happening there. <a href="http://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com" target="_blank">Check them out</a> here to see what you are missing.</p>

<p><strong>Today, we launch another milestone in data science learning – <a title="Learning paths – Data Science, Business Analytics, Business Intelligence and Big Data" href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/learning-paths-data-science-business-analytics-business-intelligence-big-data/" target="_blank">the learning paths</a>. The aim of creating these learning paths is to take out the confusion from learning process. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why create learning paths?</strong></h3>
<p>We live in a world of information overload. <strong>We come across people daily who are following too many things and chasing too many directions in their attempt to learn data science</strong>. It is hard to blame them, when there is so much content to absorb. These people start doing a MOOC – 2 videos down the line, they switch on to a blog, then a notebook and end up reaching nowhere.</p>
<p>These learning paths will provide crystal clear direction to your learning so that you can focus on learning the subject rather than worrying about what to learn. If you are a complete beginner on a topic, you couldn’t have asked for a better roadmap – you will find the entire learning journey mapped in front of you. If you are some one who has already spent some time learning – you can pick up the journey from where you are and the remaining journey should be faster, clearer and more focused!</p>
<h3><strong>Our first Learning path – Python for data science</strong></h3>
<p>The first learning path which we are launching is on <a title="Comprehensive learning path – Data Science in Python" href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/learning-path-data-science-python/" target="_blank">Python for data Science</a>. The learning path starts from why you should learn Python and goes on to provide the resource you need to become a Python machine learning expert! The Python learning path consists of 8 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><strong>Setting up your machine</strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learn the basics of Python language</strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learn Regular Expressions in Python</strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learn Scientific libraries in Python – NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas</strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Effective Data Visualization</strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Learn Scikit-learn and Machine Learning</strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Practice, practice and Practice</strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong>Deep Learning</strong></h5>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are completely new to Python, you should just follow the steps as mentioned in the path. On the other hand, one of my friends has already learnt the basics of the language – he can directly pick things from step 3 onwards. If you already know Python and want to pick up machine learning, start from step 5 or 6.</p>

<h3><strong>End Note:</strong></h3>
<p>We are super excited about launching learning paths. We think that these should help our readers immensely. So <a title="Comprehensive learning path – Data Science in Python" href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/learning-path-data-science-python/" target="_blank">check out the learning path</a> and let us know how you plan to use them. There will be more learning paths, we will add in coming days. If you have any suggestions on this awesome initiative, please feel free to reach out to me and shout in the comments below.</p>
