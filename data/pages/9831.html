<p>Here's video of the live-coding demo I did Sunday at SCALE14x: in under an hour I built a Python 3 async framework. I began by demonstrating non-blocking sockets, callbacks, and an event loop. This implementation is very efficient and rather ugly. In the second half, I build Python coroutines out of a Future class, generators, and a Task class. Coroutines are the best of both worlds: as scalable as callbacks and as straightforward as regular blocking code.</p>
