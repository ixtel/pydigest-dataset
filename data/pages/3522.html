                                                <p>I’m excited to let you know that <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftschellenbach%2FStream-Framework&amp;t=MDliMzkxNGFhZDQ5NGVmOTBkNmM2OGVmNzk1MDNiNzE5ZWI2ZTIwYSxEeDRYVUxyeA%3D%3D">Stream Framework</a> now runs on Python 3.4! As proof have a look at this beautiful report on <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Ftravis-ci.org%2Ftschellenbach%2FStream-Framework%2Fbuilds%2F52916699&amp;t=NGU3Y2M1NjU1MzQzY2UwNTRhYzJjOTAxYzViZGQ2NDg2YTc5NWIxYixEeDRYVUxyeA%3D%3D">Travis</a>. Many thanks to Anislav Atanasov for making this happen.  </p><p>More and more users of open source software seem to be asking for Python 3 support. This is just my very unscientific observation, but it seems as though we’re reaching a tipping point. People are building their apps to run on 3.4 and library authors are adding support.</p><p>Till recently there was simply no point in upgrading to 3.4. Nobody asked for it, and our dependencies didn’t support Python 3. We’ve been getting requests for Python 3 for a few months now and recently <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcqlengine%2Fcqlengine&amp;t=MDY3OGFmZjkwOWY1MDZlODkxMDBkNzM1OTJjMDk4MDMxZDkwMjZiZixEeDRYVUxyeA%3D%3D">CQLEngine</a> added support for Python 3. Many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/rustyrazorblade">Jon Haddad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/blakeeggleston">Blake Eggleston</a>!</p><p>Awesome to see that the community is moving on, it was about time for Python 3 to become a viable option :)</p>
