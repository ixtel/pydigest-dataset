            <p>Writing programs is fun, but making them fast can be a pain. Python programs
are no exception to that, but the basic profiling toolchain is actually not
that complicated to use. Here, I would like to show you how you can quickly
profile and analyze your Python code to find what part of the code you should
optimize.</p>
<h1>What's profiling?</h1>
<p>Profiling a Python program is doing a dynamic analysis that measures the
execution time of the program and everything that compose it. That means
measuring the time spent in each of its functions. This will give you data
about where your program is spending time, and what area might be worth
optimizing.</p>
<p>It's a very interesting exercise. Many people focus on local optimizations,
such as determining e.g. which of the Python functions <code>range</code> or <code>xrange</code> is
going to be faster. It turns out that knowing which one is faster may never be
an issue in your program, and that the time gained by one of the functions
above might not be worth the time you spend researching that, or arguing about
it with your colleague.</p>
<p>Trying to blindly optimize a program without measuring where it is actually
spending its time is a useless exercise. Following your guts alone is not
always sufficient.</p>
<p>There are many types of profiling, as there are many things you can measure. In
this exercise, we'll focus on CPU utilization profiling, meaning the time spent
by each function executing instructions. Obviously, we could do many more kind
of profiling and optimizations, such as memory profiling which would measure
the memory used by each piece of code – something I talk about in
<a href="/books/the-hacker-guide-to-python">The Hacker's Guide to Python</a>.</p>
<h1>cProfile</h1>
<p>Since Python 2.5, Python provides a C module called
<em><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html">cProfile</a></em> which has a
reasonable overhead and offers a good enough feature set. The basic usage goes
down to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">cProfile</span><br/><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">cProfile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'2 + 2'</span><span class="p">)</span><br/>         <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="n">function</span> <span class="n">calls</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="mf">0.000</span> <span class="n">seconds</span><br/> <br/>   <span class="n">Ordered</span> <span class="n">by</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">standard</span> <span class="n">name</span><br/> <br/>   <span class="n">ncalls</span>  <span class="n">tottime</span>  <span class="n">percall</span>  <span class="n">cumtime</span>  <span class="n">percall</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">lineno</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">function</span><span class="p">)</span><br/>        <span class="mi">1</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">string</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">)</span><br/>        <span class="mi">1</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span>    <span class="mf">0.000</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="n">method</span> <span class="s">'disable'</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="s">'_lsprof.Profiler'</span> <span class="n">objects</span><span class="p">}</span><br/></pre></div>

This prints out all the function called, with the time spend in each and the
number of times they have been called.</p>
<h2>Advanced visualization with KCacheGrind</h2>
<p>While being useful, the output format is very basic and does not make easy to
grab knowledge for complete programs.
For more advanced visualization, I leverage
<a href="https://kcachegrind.github.io/html/Home.html">KCacheGrind</a>. If you did any C
programming and profiling these last years, you may have used it as it is
primarily designed as front-end for <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> generated
call-graphs.</p>
<p>In order to use, you need to generate a <em>cProfile</em> result file, then convert it
to KCacheGrind format. To do that, I use
<em><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyprof2calltree">pyprof2calltree</a></em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>python -m cProfile -o myscript.cprof myscript.py<br/><span class="nv">$ </span>pyprof2calltree -k -i myscript.cprof<br/></pre></div>

<p><br/>
And the KCacheGrind window magically appears!</p>

<h1>Concrete case: Carbonara optimization</h1>
<p>I was curious about the performances of
<a href="https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/gnocchi/tree/gnocchi/carbonara.py">Carbonara</a>,
the small timeserie library I wrote for
<a href="http://launchpad.net/gnocchi">Gnocchi</a>. I decided to do some basic profiling
to see if there was any obvious optimization to do.</p>
<p>In order to profile a program, you need to run it. But running the whole
program in profiling mode can generate <em>a lot</em> of data that you don't care
about, and adds noise to what you're trying to understand. Since Gnocchi has
thousands of unit tests and a few for Carbonara itself, I decided to profile
the code used by these unit tests, as it's a good reflection of basic features
of the library.</p>
<p>Note that this is a good strategy for a curious and naive first-pass profiling.
There's no way that you can make sure that the hotspots you will see in the
unit tests are the actual hotspots you will encounter in production. Therefore,
a profiling in conditions and with a scenario that mimics what's seen in
production is often a necessity if you need to push your program optimization
further and want to achieve perceivable and valuable gain.</p>
<p>I activated <em>cProfile</em> using the method described above, creating a
<code>cProfile.Profile</code> object around my tests (I actually
<a href="https://github.com/testing-cabal/testtools/pull/163">started to implement that in testtools</a>).
I then run <em>KCacheGrind</em> as described above. Using <em>KCacheGrind</em>, I generated
the following figures.</p>
<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/kcachegrind-carbonara-old-list.png"/>
</figure>

<p>The test I profiled here is called <code>test_fetch</code> and is pretty easy to
understand: it puts data in a timeserie object, and then fetch the aggregated
result. The above list shows that 88 % of the ticks are spent in <code>set_values</code>
(44 ticks over 50). This function is used to insert values into the timeserie,
not to fetch the values. That means that it's really slow to insert data, and
pretty fast to actually retrieve them.</p>
<p>Reading the rest of the list indicates that several functions share the rest of
the ticks, <code>update</code>, <code>_first_block_timestamp</code>, <code>_truncate</code>, <code>_resample</code>, etc.
Some of the functions in the list are not part of Carbonara, so there's no
point in looking to optimize them. The only thing that can be optimized is,
sometimes, the number of times they're called.</p>
<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/kcachegrind-carbonara-old-graph.png"/>
</figure>

<p>The call graph gives me a bit more insight about what's going on here. Using my
knowledge about how Carbonara works, I don't think that the whole stack on the
left for <code>_first_block_timestamp</code> makes much sense. This function is supposed
to find the first timestamp for an aggregate, e.g. with a timestamp of 13:34:45
and a period of 5 minutes, the function should return 13:30:00. The way it
works currently is by calling the <code>resample</code> function from Pandas on a
timeserie with only one element, but that seems to be very slow. Indeed,
currently this function represents 25 % of the time spent by <code>set_values</code> (11
ticks on 44).</p>
<p>Fortunately, I recently added a small function called <code>_round_timestamp</code> that
does exactly what <code>_first_block_timestamp</code> needs that without calling any
Pandas function, so no <code>resample</code>. So I ended up rewriting that function this
way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>def _first_block_timestamp(self):<br/><span class="gd">-        ts = self.ts[-1:].resample(self.block_size)</span><br/><span class="gd">-        return (ts.index[-1] - (self.block_size * self.back_window))</span><br/><span class="gi">+        rounded = self._round_timestamp(self.ts.index[-1], self.block_size)</span><br/><span class="gi">+        return rounded - (self.block_size * self.back_window)</span><br/></pre></div>

<p><br/>
And then I re-run the exact same test to compare the output of <em>cProfile</em>.</p>
<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/kcachegrind-carbonara-new-list.png"/>
  </figure>

<p>The list of function seems quite different this time. The number of time spend
used by <code>set_values</code> dropped from 88 % to 71 %.</p>
<figure class="illustration">
  <img src="/media/images/blog/2015/kcachegrind-carbonara-new-graph.png"/>
</figure>

<p>The call stack for <code>set_values</code> shows that pretty well: we can't even see the
<code>_first_block_timestamp</code> function as it is so fast that it totally disappeared
from the display. It's now being considered insignificant by the profiler.</p>
<p>So we just speed up the whole insertion process of values into Carbonara by a
nice 25 % in a few minutes. Not that bad for a first naive pass, right?</p>          </div>

          </div></body></html>
