<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Install via pip:</p>
<pre>$ pip install <span class="nb">let</span>
</pre>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>If you insist on the (slightly) harder way of installing, from source,
you know how to do it already and don’t need my help.</p>
<p>I might later upload the source to:

<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<p>Once you’ve installed, you can really quickly verified that it works with just this:</p>
<pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">let</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">let</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Hello World!'</span><span class="p">)):</span>
<span class="o">...</span>     <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">12</span>
</pre>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>In C, Java, and many other languages, it’s possible to assign variables inside
of if or while condition statements. This is useful in allowing you to concisely
both assign the value, and check whether a condition is met.</p>
<p>This ability doesn’t exist in Python, because of the thought that when people
write something like:</p>
<pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetch_results</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
<p>They may have actually meant:</p>
<pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetch_results</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
<p>Personally, I have never made this mistake. It seems far more like a theoretical
mistake that could plausibly happen than one that actually happens and warrants
removing features, as was chosen in Python.</p>
<p>Anyways, the let function in this module gives you something very close to that
ability in other languages. A few examples:</p>
<pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">longInstanceName</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">longAttributeName</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>

<span class="c1"># Yes, db.fetch_results() should just return a generator. No, it doesn't.</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetch_results</span><span class="p">()):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">let</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nameValuePair</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Bad amount: {}'</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">))</span>
