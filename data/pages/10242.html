<h2>DjangoCon Europe 2016: Call for Sponsors</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Ola Sitarska, Baptiste Mispelon</strong> on February 9, 2016 </span>

<p>A number of generous sponsors have already stepped forward to help make <a class="reference external" href="https://2016.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe</a> happen, but we need more. Can you help? <a class="reference external" href="mailto:2016@djangocon.eu">We'd love to hear from you</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://2016.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe</a> is run entirely by volunteers, and every cent received in sponsorship will go towards making it the best event possible. The organizers aim to make the event as affordable and accessible as possible for everyone.</p>
<p>With your help, here are some of the things we're able to do:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provide 20 free tickets and 5000€ towards the Scholarship program,</li>
<li>assist a Django Girls workshop with 21 hugely discounted tickets for the attendees,</li>
<li>offer complimentary child care to everyone attending the conference with their children,</li>
<li>offer live captioning and subsequent text transcripts of all talks at the conference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sponsoring DjangoCon Europe is a great way to recruit Django developers, promote your product or give back to the community. The sponsorship packages start at 500€ and you can find more information in the <a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/sponsor-dceu16">sponsorship brochure</a>.</p>
