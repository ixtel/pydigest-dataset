            <p>A slightly underused(or less needed for most projects) feature of
frameworks are the signals they provide.</p>
<p>Signals allows you to hook a certain action initiated to some code that
you provide.</p>
<p>For example, whenever there is a request comming to your web
application, then your framework initiate a signal at the begining of
the request (before it reaches your view) and a signal at the end of the
request (after you have rendered your view and it's ready to be sent to
the user).</p>
<p>Here is an examples for Django and Flask on how you could use them to
make basic analytics of your site.</p>

<p>Although this is a very simple example, but they don't have to be overy
complex to be usefull.</p>
<p>This is taking data from the request and storing them in redis as
ordered set.</p>
<p>Every time the same value occures it will increase it's score by one,
that's what <code>zincrby</code> does.</p>
<p>The first one is the url path, this allows you to track how many page
views any page had.</p>
<p>Note that we are adding it only if the url ends with "/" because usually
if someone visites <code>http://.../path</code> they
get redirected to <code>http://.../path/</code> with a
slash at the end, so we don't save it twice.</p>
<p>The second one is for the referers, when a user get to your page through
another page the browser would set the Referer header in the HTTP
request so you know where it is coming from.</p>
<p>But now that this can easy be forged, any one can visit your site and
modify this header by intention.</p>
<p>The third is the browser the user is using, the framework works this out
from the HTTP header <code>User-Agent</code>.</p>
<p>The fourth is the platform (linux, windows, ios ...), this is also
worked out from the <code>User-Agent</code> header.</p>
<p>See, in just a few lines of code we are accumelating data about page
views, where they are coming from. what browser they are using, and what
platform or OS.</p>
<p>In Django you will have to include that in as middleware e.g. save this
as mymiddleware.py in your app folder and add
'app.mymiddleware.Analytics' to the setting MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES.</p>
<p>Also we used <code>HTTP_USER_AGENT</code> instead of
browser and platform, that is because django doesn't parse this header
string, you will have to use a library to parse that.</p>
<p>The header string looks something like this <code>Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 5_1 like Mac OS X)
AppleWebKit/534.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.1 Mobile/9B179
Safari/7534.48.3</code></p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/user-agents/">this library</a> to
parse it.</p>
<p>To read the data simply query the keys with redis, e.g.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&gt;&gt; redis.zrange('visitors', 0, -1, withscores=True)

&gt;&gt; [('/atom/', 2922.0), ('/blog/1/', 8360.0), ('/', 8714.0)]
</pre></div>


<p>A tuple of the path and the score(view count)</p>
<p>There are some other uses and signals available, for database <code>pre_save</code>,
<code>post_save</code>, <code>pre_delete</code> .. and so on.</p>
<p>Other uses is also by tracking the users remote ip and ignore a request
after a certain amount of POST request for a form, so for example after
posting a 5 comments in an hour then just ignore the POST request, you
don't handle it to avoid spam.</p>
<p>Although this is good, it's not perfect as one can use proxy, but for
most cases this would work.</p>
