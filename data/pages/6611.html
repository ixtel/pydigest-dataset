<h2>New options for donating to the DSF</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on September 9, 2015 </span>

<p>Earlier this year, the DSF launched a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/campaign/django-fellowship/">fundraising campaign</a> to help pay for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/mar/06/welcome-our-full-time-django-fellow/">Django Fellowship</a>. That campaign was extremely successful, hitting the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/jan/27/django-fellowship-fundraising-goal-achieved/">fundraising target in just six days</a>.</p>
<p>However, we can't stop there. If the DSF Fellow is going to be an ongoing program, we're going to need to continue to raise money. To help with this, we've added three new ways to contribute to the DSF.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-regular-donations">
<h3>Regular donations</h3>
<p>In addition to a once-off donation, we've set up the ability for you to register for an automatic monthly, quarterly, or yearly donation. This allows you to spread your donation over an entire year, rather than making a single large donation. It also makes it easier for the DSF to predict our income, as we know what our regular recurring donations will raise.</p>
<p>To set up a recurring donation, you use the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">same donation page</a> that you use for one-off donations - you just select a recurring period for your donation.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-benevity">
<h3>Benevity</h3>
<p>The Django Software Foundation is now a participant in the <strong>Benevity Workplace Giving program</strong>. When your employer becomes a member of the Benevity community, you are able to make donations to the DSF via payroll deduction. Many employers offer a matching contribution as well, increasing the amount that the DSF receives from your donation.</p>
<p>Benevity is available to employers in any country, and works with your companyâ€™s payroll department for ease of use from set up to payments.</p>
<p>Check with your employer to see if they participate in Benevity, or visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.benevity.com/">Benevity website</a> to find out more if your employer is not yet part of the Benevity program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-amazon-smile">
<h3>Amazon Smile</h3>
<p>Lastly, we've signed up the DSF as a recipient for <strong>Amazon Smile</strong>. When you shop at Amazon, you can nominate for 0.5% of the purchase price of your eligible AmazonSmile purchases to be donated to the Django Software Foundation.</p>
<p>For more details, or to sign up, visit the <a class="reference external" href="https://smile.amazon.com/">Amazon Smile website</a>.</p>
