<span><a href="http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/11/29/data-animations-with-python-and-moviepy/" target="_blank">Data Animations With Python and MoviePy</a></span><br/>
Python has some great data vizualization librairies, but few can render GIFs or video animations. This post shows how to use MoviePy as a generic animation plugin for any other library.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://ericniebler.com/2014/12/07/a-slice-of-python-in-c/" target="_blank">A Slice of Python in C++</a></span><br/>
This post describes a fun piece of hackery that went into my Range-v3 library recently: a Python-like range slicing facility with cute, short syntax. It's nothing earth-shattering from a functionality point of view, but it's a fun little case study in library design, and it nicely illustrates my philosophy of library design.<br/>

In this tutorial, we'll take the command line image search engine from the previous tutorial and turn it into a full-blown web application using Python and Flask. More specifically, we'll be creating a Single Page Application (SPA) that consumes data via AJAX (on the front-end) from an internal, REST-like API via Python/Flask (on the back-end).<br/>

<span><a href="https://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/django-and-flask" target="_blank">Django and Flask: Why and When To Use Which</a></span><br/>
In this video Eric Schles, Dev evangelist at Syncano, gives a compare and contrast talk on Django and Flask frameworks. Eric walks through some strengths of Flask: low overhead, easy to set up, good for prototyping etc., and some weaknesses: poor built-in debugging tools, not built to scale well, not strongly object-oriented. On the Django side of things, Eric points to strengths: object oriented, production level code under a deadline, and the benefits of the admin panel. However, Eric cautions viewers about the high overhead of set up and warns beginners about challenges.<br/>

<span><a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/caching-external-api-requests/" target="_blank">Caching External API Requests</a></span><br/>
Ever find yourself making the exact same request to an external API, using the exact same parameters and returning the exact same results? If so, then you should cache this request to limit the number of HTTP requests to help improve performance. Let's look at an example using the requests package.<br/>
