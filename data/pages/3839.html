<span><a href="http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2015/03/coursera-data-mining/" target="_blank">Hacking Education with Python - Data Mining Coursera for Popular Courses</a></span><br/>
This tutorial combines coursera data together with social media data to assess the popularity of courses. To to this, it uses the Coursera API to retrieve the course catalogue, sharecount.com API to get social media metrics for each course, and python's pandas library to query and order the courses by popularity.<br/>

<span><a href="http://jamesls.com/writing-redis-in-python-with-asyncio-part-1.html" target="_blank">Writing Redis in Python with asyncio: Part 1</a></span><br/>
A series of articles that shows how to write redis in pure python using asyncio library. In part 1, we will look at getting a basic redis implementation up and running using asyncio and fakeredis. You will be able to run basic commands such as get, set, lpush, lrange, sadd, smembers, hmset, hget, etc.<br/>

<span><a href="http://tech.zalando.com/posts/entering-kernel-namespaces-with-python.html" target="_blank">Entering Kernel Namespaces with Python</a></span><br/>
When working with Docker containers usually the question arises on how to connect into a running container without starting an explicit SSH daemon (which is considered a bad idea). This leads us to Linux Kernel namespaces.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF9BFf0mL4E" target="_blank">Discovery Engines: Network Analysis</a></span><br/>
Network analysis has become an indispensable toolkit as more and more relational data are made available. In this video, F. Bill Shi of Knowledge Lab reviews the state of the art of modern network analysis, and provides a hands-on tutorial on three problems that have found successful applications in the real world (one of which has made billions of dollars): how to rank nodes, how to identify meaningful clusters of nodes, and how to predict potential links in a network.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/03/analyzing-the-web-for-the-price-of-a-sandwich.html" target="_blank">Analyzing the Web For the Price of a Sandwich</a></span><br/>
The Common Crawl is a great public resource. You can scan over huge portions of the web with some simple tools and a price of a sandwich. MRJob makes this super easy with Python. Give it a try!<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/23/sliding-windows-for-object-detection-with-python-and-opencv/" target="_blank">Sliding Windows for Object Detection with Python and OpenCV</a></span><br/>
In last week's post we discovered how to construct an image pyramid. And in today's article we are going to extend that example and introduce the concept of a sliding window. Sliding windows play an integral role in object classification, as they allow us to localize exactly "where" in an image an object resides.<br/>
