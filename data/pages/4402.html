<h1>Platter</h1>
<p>Platter is a tool for Python that simplifies deployments on Unix servers.
Itâ€™s a thin wrapper around pip, virtualenv and wheel and aids in creating
packages that can install without compiling or downloading on servers.</p>
<p>Why would you want to use it?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fastest way to build and distribute Python packages in an ecosystem
you control.  With the built-in caching we have seen build time
improvements from 400 seconds down to 20 seconds for releases with no
version changes on dependencies.</li>
<li>no need to compile or download anything on the destination servers you
distribute your packages to.  Everything (with the exception of the
interpreter itself) comes perfectly bundled up.</li>
<li>100% control over your dependencies.  No accidental version mismatches
on your servers (this includes system dependencies like setuptools,
pip and virtualenv).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the tool directly from PyPI:</p>

<p>To create a platter distribution all you need is this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ platter build /path/to/your/python/package
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once this finishes, it will have created a tarball of the fully built
Python package together will all dependencies and an installation script.
You can then take this package and push it to as many servers as you want
and install it:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ tar -xzf package-VERSION-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
$ cd package-VERSION-linux-x86_64
$ ./install.sh /srv/yourpackage/versions/VERSION
$ ln -sf VERSION /srv/yourpackage/versions/current
</pre></div>
