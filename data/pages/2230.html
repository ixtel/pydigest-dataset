<p>It appears that your cygwin setup does not have the gcc compiler configured correctly. I would start by looking there as it is actual compile errors not a missing compiler.</p>

<p>*** Here is a line from your own paste.</p>

<p>C:\Program Files\Python27\include/pyport.h:886:2: error: #error "LONG_BIT definition appears wrong for platform (bad gcc/glibc config?)."</p>

<h1>error "LONG_BIT definition appears wrong for platform (bad gcc/glibc config?)."</h1>

<hr/>

<p>This error is purely about a misconfiguration after configure ran which would point to cygwin's gcc not being configured correctly. </p>

<p>The compiler was found and attempted to build the source so the issue is not the vc redistributables not being found. </p>
