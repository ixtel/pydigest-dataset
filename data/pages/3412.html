<p><em>pyglet</em> provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing games and other visually-rich applications for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. </p>
<p>Some of the features of pyglet are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No external dependencies or installation requirements.</strong> For most application and game requirements, <em>pyglet</em> needs nothing else besides Python, simplifying distribution and installation.</li>
<li><strong>Take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor desktops.</strong> <em>pyglet</em> allows you to use as many windows as you need, and is fully aware of multi-monitor setups for use with fullscreen games.</li>
<li><strong>Load images, sound, music and video in almost any format.</strong> <em>pyglet</em> can optionally use AVbin to play back audio formats such as MP3, OGG/Vorbis and WMA, and video formats such as DivX, MPEG-2, H.264, WMV and Xvid.</li>
<li><strong>pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license</strong>, allowing you to use it for both commercial and other open-source projects with very little restriction.</li>
</ul>
