<p><b>Custom Ansible Modules</b>  <br/></p> 
<p>This will be an instructor led walk-through on creating your own custom Ansible module. The example to be live coded (*fingers crossed*) will involve hitting a Magic 8-ball REST API to retrieve a response to a user-supplied question and will fail if the response is negative and continue if the response is affirmative.</p>

<p><b>Computer Recreations</b></p> 
<p>When teaching programming, it's difficult to come up with examples and exercises that are both not too complicated yet still interesting. This talk will revisit a historical source of interesting programming ideas: the 1980s Computer Recreations column in "Scientific American".</p>
