Python gives us deep introspecting and metaprogramming capabilities including bytecode and AST support in the standard library. This facilitates unobvious ways to write code that writes code or otherwise alters its behavior. I will show several different examples of how it could be used for fun and profit.<br/>

How do you statically model an ever changing world? In this presentation we'll look at the reality of doing DDD with Python (though many of the lessons extend to any dynamic language.) We'll explore when and how dynamic language solutions are most appropriate for domain models, and discusses the trade-offs between flexibility, maintainability and performance in doing so. The talk is illustrated with experiences drawn from building industrial domain models in Python in the energy sector to support high performance computing applications.<br/>

<span><a href="https://jessesw.com/Data-Science-Skills/" target="_blank">Web Scraping Indeed for Key Data Science Job Skills</a></span><br/>
In this post, I am going to scrape job postings from Indeed.com for data science jobs and see which skills employers want the most (Python or R? Are they interested in Spark yet? How dominant are NoSQL databases? Are they using proprietary software like SAS or are companies preferring open source now?) To make it even better, I will create the program so that I can have a detailed breakdown by city.<br/>
