<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a neat site which has questions to
very complex math problems that you can't reasonably figure out without the help
of a computer - so it makes for a perfect combination of math and programming
nerdiness.</p>

<p>In an effort to learn python, these are my programatic solutions to some of
these problems. Scripts are named according to which question they answer, and
the question is given as comments at the top of each script.</p>
