<p>Slack Export Archive Viewer</p><p>








# Slack Export Viewer</p><p>A Slack Export archive viewer that allows you to easily view and share your </p><p>Slack team's export (instead of having to dive into hundreds of JSON files).</p><p>![Preview](screenshot.png)</p><p>## Overview</p><p>`slack-export-viewer` is useful for small teams on a free Slack plan (limited to 10,000 messages) who overrun their budget and ocassionally need a nice interface to refer back to previous messages. You get a web interface to easily scroll through all channels in the export without having to look at individual JSON files per channel per day.</p><p>`slack-export-viewer` can be used locally on one machine for yourself to explore an export or it can be run on a headless server (as it is a Flask web app) if you also want to serve the content to the rest of your team.</p><p>## Usage</p><p>### 1) Grab your Slack team's export</p><p>* Visit [https://yourslackteam.slack.com/services/export]</p><p>(https://yourslackteam-magellan.slack.com/services/export) (*yourslackteam* should obviously be replaced with your **actual** Slack team)</p><p>* Create an export</p><p>* Wait for it to complete</p><p>* Refresh the page and download the export (.zip file) into whatever directory</p><p>### 2) Point `slack-export-viewer` to it</p><p>Point slack-export-viewer to the .zip file and let it do its magic</p><p>```bash</p><p>slack-export-viewer -z /path/to/export/zip</p><p>```</p><p>If everything went well, your archive will have been extracted, processed, and browser window will have opened showing your *#general* channel from the export.</p><p>## Installation</p><p>I recommend [`pipsi`](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi) for a nice </p><p>isolated install.</p><p>```bash</p><p>pipsi install slack-export-viewer</p><p>```</p><p>Or just feel free to use `pip` as you like.</p><p>```bash</p><p>pip install slack-export-viewer</p><p>```</p><p>`slack-export-viewer` will be installed as an entry-point; run from anywhere.</p><p>```bash</p><p>$ slack-export-viewer --help</p><p>Usage: slack-export-viewer [OPTIONS]</p><p>Options:</p><p>  -p, --port INTEGER  Host port to serve your content on</p><p>  -z, --archive PATH  Path to your Slack export archive (.zip file)</p><p>                      [required]</p><p>  -I, --ip TEXT       Host IP to serve your content on</p><p>  --no-browser        If you do not want a browser to open automatically, set</p><p>                      this.</p><p>  --debug</p><p>  --help              Show this message and exit.</p><p>```</p><p>## Acknowledgements</p><p>Credit to Pieter Levels whose [blog post](https://levels.io/slack-export-to-html/) and PHP script I used as a jumping off point for this.</p><p>### Improvements over Pieter's script</p><p> `slack-export-viewer` is similar in core functionality but adds several things on top to make it nicer to use:</p><p>* An installable application</p><p>* Automated archive extraction and retention</p><p>* A Slack-like sidebar that lets you switch channels easily</p><p>* Much more "sophisticated" rendering of messages</p><p>* A Flask server which lets you serve the archive contents as opposed to a PHP script which does static file generation
