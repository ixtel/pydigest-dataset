                    <p>This year in June, the European edition of <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.eu">DjangoCon</a> is going to be held in lovely <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich">Zurich</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. It is my great fortune and delight to announce that <a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com">Audrey</a> and I will be attending. Hooray!</p>
<p>Needless to say, we're extremely excited. My <a class="reference external" href="http://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/search/label/ploneconf2007">trip to Europe in 2007</a> was an amazingly fun and educational experience, and I can't wait to share a similar experience with Audrey. We can't wait to see all our old European friends, make new ones, and be dazzled by what Europe has to offer.</p>
<p>Also, let's face it, the conference is going to be <strong>incredible</strong>. They've lined up some awesome venues, the food (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette">cheese</a>, chocolate, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli">muesli</a>, etc) in Switzerland is world-renowned, the website looks fantastic, and they've got Jacob Kaplan-Moss to keynote. It looks so good I'm surprised there are any <a class="reference external" href="http://2012.djangocon.eu/sponsors/">sponsor slots left</a>!</p>

<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>While attending the conference, we submitted and hope to give a presentation on the positives (speed, flexibility, community, etc) and negatives (a few) of using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> as a <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> datastore. I'm also considering giving a second talk. Some ideas for that include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Zen of Django</li>
<li>Django isn't for beginners (A Tredennick inspired talk explaining why teaching beginning developers Django isn't a good idea)</li>
<li>Advanced Django Template Usage</li>
<li>Advanced Django Models Usage (An intimidating talk to put together)</li>
<li>Django Packages Thunderdome II</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>While I'm at it, I'm going to poke any prospective conference goers to submit their own talks. I love attending conference talks and at PyCon US this year I barely got to see any. Show me what you got!</p>
