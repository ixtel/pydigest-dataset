		<p>I recently gave a talk at the Boston Area Python User Group Meeting about a new style of Quantum Chemistry class that I helped develop in the fall of 2014. My PhD advisor, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, as well as fellow teaching fellows Dr David Tempel and Adrian Jinich taught the course with an extremely computational focus. While we didn’t necessarily ignore the nice derivations that are often present in quantum mechanics courses, we put a stronger focus on interpreting numerical answers. We simply wanted to bring the chemical intuition back to quantum chemistry. You see, Chemistry is incredibly powerful because at one level you can get incredibly far with some really straight forward heuristics and some cleverness, but these heuristics can be placed on rigorous footing with quantum mechanics. Truly, that’s the point of teaching quantum chemistry. Said another way, quantum chemistry provides a way to unify each and every heuristic a chemist will learn in his/her chemistry career. So it’s truly a shame when chemistry students are afraid of their quantum chemistry courses, or if we truly fail to reach them.</p>
<p>We found that many chemistry students truly struggled with the extremely mathematical nature of the subject after examining the multiple years of student complaints. This is because most courses were structured to teach essentially a quantum mechanics course with a small secondary focus on chemistry applications. Where’s the natural place to get advice on how to teach this? A physics department, of course! And their students have years of math under their belts by the time that they take quantum mechanics, so that can typically handle any of the math that you throw at them. Beyond this, quantum mechanics courses normally focus on solving relatively straight-forward toy models and how to interpret their solutions as analogies for actual physical systems. In fact, it’s not terribly uncommon to be expected to develop some type of model on an exam for some sort of physical experiment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, chemists typically don’t take years of math courses because they’re busy taking actual chemistry courses. So most quantum chemistry courses work by first giving the students what amounts to a “math bootcamp” where we usually explain the relevant parts of differential equations, partial differential equations, calculus, and linear algebra and hope that they hold on. Unfortunately, this is rarely a winning strategy. While the students often hold a basic understanding of when they need to do something (for example, when to find eigenvalues), they struggle with the actual calculation of them. Whereas someone with a high degree of math fluency would not be all that worried about a missing factor of two in an ODE solution, for example, a student just doing this for the first time would view this with near existential dread.</p>
<p>Given that the students can often understand <em>when</em> they needed to find eigenvalues, or solve an ODE, we decided that we would just teach the course from a numerical perspective. After all, a computer is pretty fantastic at doing such things. And we wanted to make the programming as user-friendly and unintimidating as possible, so we decided that we’d have the students do as much as possible within an IPython notebook. This is because IPython notebooks provide an incredible interface for conveying information via LaTeX and Markdown, inline graphics, and code execution without being as intimidating as a command line. Keep in mind that for many of these students, it was their first ever experience programming. Because we wanted the students to have a wonderful experience, and because I couldn’t imagine a sweeter hell than having to get fifty different machines running the same exact python stack. Our virtual machine ran linux mint, virtual box, python 2.7, scipy, numpy, mayavi, etc.</p>
<p>We structured the course so that Alán would lecture during class. His lectures tended to be pretty intuitive, and focused on the physics and chemistry that you can learn from trends, model solutions, and approximations. This was particularly useful for the students given his many years of domain expertise.</p>
<p>David wrote and produced a wonderful set of pencasts that would delve deeply into the topics that Alán lectured from an intuitive point of view. David filled the role of a textbook, and, in doing so, provided the students with an incredible resource to learn from. In fact, this is where we presented many of the derivations that normally dominate a standard quantum chemistry course. We felt that it was important to give the students this resource because they could go back and really spend time understanding and interrogating the math. Beyond that, David did a fantastic job of physically motivating each step. In fact, I often felt that the pencasts were pushed forward by physical considerations instead of math for math’s sake.</p>
<p>We usually had a python demo at the end of lecture that would usually cover something related to the lecture topic. For example, we computed and plotted the band structure of graphene after a lecture on periodic systems. We usually had a teaching fellow walk the students through the coding step by step by programming on the projector. The students seemed to generally enjoy this, but felt that we’d occasionally rush through the code because, well, we did.</p>
<p>The students loved that they were able to see our programming logic line by line. In fact, one of the things that the students initially struggled with was reading an equation and translating it to code. In retrospect, we should have expected this, and maybe even spent some time just explaining the general principles. They also got to see us debug in front of them, which was incredibly valuable. We hadn’t even considered teaching debugging when we set out to teach this course! It was second nature as experienced programmers to do so. We’ll have to figure out ways to teach this next time.</p>
<p>I presented before and after screenshots of an IPython notebook as an example of how these demos normally worked. In the preparation for this demo, I wrote a review of the lecture in markdown, so that the students could see exactly which equations they were translating into code. With that in hand, I stood up in class and guided them through the code, step by step, explaining how each line translated some part of the equation. I inevitably had bugs, so I spent time reading the error messages and explaining to them what the errors meant and how to fix them. It worked wonderfully.</p>
<p>Every week or two we would give the students programming based homework assignments using IPython. These assignments centered around problems that the teaching staff felt were extremely interesting and required numerical solutions. For example, we had the students compute the frequency of the ammonia maser and saw agreement to within 4% with the experimental value. On another homework assignment, we had the students run their own mini-clean energy project, where they performed quantum mechanical screening for efficient solar cells. The students loved these!</p>
<p>We gave the students a relatively advanced programming assignment in lieu of giving the students a written final exam. The hope was that they’d be able to write a hartree-fock code from the ground up, and then apply it to various chemical systems of interest. We figured that if the students could do this, they would truly understand a good portion of quantum chemistry. Of course, we had to write the instructions to be fairly pedagogical. As you can see in some of the slides, we often had guidelines for the steps that they should follow, as well as all the relevant equations. You can see this in some of the slides where, for example, we walked them through creating and storing the 2-electron integrals.</p>
<p>With a working hartree-fock code in hand, the students were able to apply their code to systems of chemical interest. We had them compute the orbitals of benzene, and almost all of the students were amazed that they could produced the same figures that they saw in their textbooks, with relatively little effort. The students also saw how the codes that they wrote could be used to predict an SN2 reaction.</p>
<p>There are certainly some rough edges that need to be fixed. I’m currently exploring better options for a VM, for example. Additionally, we should probably find a reasonable way to teach the students how to debug at the beginning of the semester, instead of somewhere in the middle. The same can be said about our teaching of mental models of code. I think the biggest thing, however, is that we should find a way to set expectations. A few of the students felt blindsided by the course and the heavy programming emphasis. I feel like part of that was simply the fact that we radically changed the course, and it’ll get better next year.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there was a lot to be proud of. Our students learned enough python and chemistry that they were able to write their own relatively complex quantum chemistry code, apply it to their own problems of interest, and then interpret the results. This was a huge win! Our students also learned quite a bit of python, as well. I have one student mention that he just got ~250 CSV files from a series of experiments that he did in November. He was amazed at how simple it was to just use python to read in and analyze that data. He remarked to me that doing the same in Excel would have taken close to 50 hours, where as the python solution took 2.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, I’ll write about some of the more interesting IPython demos and exercises.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank Alán, Adrian, and David. Without them, this course would have been impossible.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the slides!</p>
