<p><span>On November 4, please join other SF Python Members and hear more about performance and concurrency with large data set.</span></p>
<p><b>Lightning talks</b>:</p>
<p>Scott Lobdell -<i> Finisher: A Lightweight Autocomplete Typeahead library for Python</i></p>
<p>Moshe Zadka - <i>Deploying Python Applications</i></p>
<p>Josh Berkus - <i>Docker &gt; Virtualenv</i></p>
<p><b>Talk 1: Fast numerical optimization in Python</b></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p><span>Python often has a reputation of being ill suited for heavy duty numerical computation. The traditional wisdom is to prototype in Python and rewrite in C++ when ready. This talk will showcase some very cool technologies such as Cython and Numba which allow programmers to minimize the amount of low level code needed while still achieving close to C++ performance and maintaining high level Python interfaces.  <br/>  <br/>I will demonstrate these techniques by detailing implementations of numerical optimization algorithms for various machine learning tasks.    <br/></span></p>
<p><span><b>Bio:  </b></span></p>
<p>Stephen Tu is a PhD student at UC Berkeley. </p>
<p><b>Talk 2: Dask.array and Parallel PyData</b></p>
<p><span><b>Abstract:</b></span></p>
<p>Python has a tenuous relationship with parallelism due to the global interpreter lock (GIL). The PyData ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, ...) can get around these issues by relying on its C/Fortran foundations. Dask is a library that leverages this workaround and parallelizes a broad subset of NumPy and Pandas operations.</p>
<p>This talk discusses the limitations of the GIL, the foundations of the PyData software stack, and the ongoing state of parallelizing Python data analysis by the PyData community.</p>
<p><span><b>Bio:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Matthew Rocklin is a computational scientist at Continuum Analytics and full time open source developer within the scientific Python ecosystem. He builds libraries for out-of-core and distributed computing that target non-expert users.</span> </p>
