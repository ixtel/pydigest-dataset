  <p>This post <a href="http://vknight.org/unpeudemath/pedagogy/2015/02/07/playing_against_a_mixed_strategy_in_class/">mirrors this post from last
year</a>
in which I described how my students and I played against various mixed
strategies in a modified version of matching pennies.</p>

<p>This is the game we played:</p>



<p>I wrote a sage interact that allows for a quick visualisation of a random sample from a mixed strategy.</p>

<p>I handed out sheets of papers on which students would input their preferred strategies (‘H’ or ‘T’) whilst I sampled randomly from 3 different mixed strategies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>\(\sigma_1 = (.2, .8)\)</li>
  <li>\(\sigma_1 = (.9, .1)\)</li>
  <li>\(\sigma_1 = (1/3, 2/3\)</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on the class notation that implies that the computer was the row player and the students the column player.
The sampled strategies were (we played 6 rounds for each mixed strategy):</p>

<ol>
  <li>TTHTTT</li>
  <li>HHHTHT</li>
  <li>TTTTTH</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="round-1">Round 1</h3>

<p>This mixed strategy (recall \(\sigma_1=(.2,.8)\)) implies that the computer will be mainly playing T (the second strategy equivalent to the second row), and so based on the bi-matrix it is in the students interest to play H.
Here is a plot of the mixed strategy played by all the students:</p>

<p>The mixed strategy played was \(\sigma_2=(.54,.46)\).
Note that in fact in this particular instance that actual best response is to play \(\sigma_2=(1,0)\).
This will indeed maximise the expected value of:</p>



<p>Indeed: the above is an increasing linear function in \(x\) so the highest value is obtained when \(x=1\).</p>

<p>The mean score for this round by everyone was: 1.695.
The theoretical mean score (when playing the best response for six consecutive games is): \(6(-.2\times 2+.8)=2.4\), so (compared to last year) this was quite low.</p>

<p>Here is a distribution of the scores:</p>

<p><img src="/unpeudemath/assets/images/2015-2016-score_histogram.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>We see that a fair number of students lost but 1 student did get the highest
possible score (7).</p>

<h3 id="round-2">Round 2</h3>

<p>Here the mixed strategy is \(\sigma_1=(.9,.1)\), implying that students should play T more often than H.
Here is a plot of the mixed strategy played by all the students:</p>

<p><img src="/unpeudemath/assets/images/2015-2016-R2strategiesvbestresponse.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The mixed strategy played was \(\sigma_2=(0.329,0.671)\).  Similarly to before
this is not terribly close to the actual best response which is \((0,1)\) (due
to the expected utility now being a decreasing linear function in \(x\).</p>

<p>Here is a distribution of the scores:</p>

<p><img src="/unpeudemath/assets/images/2015-2016-R2-score_histogram.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>We see that some still managed to lose this round but overall mainly winners.</p>

<h3 id="round-3">Round 3</h3>

<p>Here is where things get interesting.
The mixed strategy played by the computer is here \(\sigma_1=(1/3,2/3)\), it is not now obvious which strategy is worth going for!</p>

<p>Here is the distribution played:</p>

<p><img src="/unpeudemath/assets/images/2015-2016-R3strategiesvbestresponse.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The mixed strategy is \(\sigma_2=(0.58,0.42) and the mean score was 1.11.
Here is what the distribution looked like:</p>

<p><img src="/unpeudemath/assets/images/2015-2016-R3-score_histogram.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>It looks like we have a few more losers than winners but not by much.</p>

could/should have expected to play in this final round</a>.</p>
