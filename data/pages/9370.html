                    <p><a class="reference external" href="http://cairographics.org/pycairo/">Pycairo</a> is the binding for the <a class="reference external" href="http://cairographics.org/">cairo graphics library</a>. It's also not something you can get running with a simple <tt class="docutils literal">pip install py2cairo</tt>. After many hours of working the search engines and dancing to the configure/make/make install melody, I figured out an answer that worked for me.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-2-install-homebrew">
<h2>Step 2 - Install Homebrew</h2>
<p>I use Homebrew instead of Macports. If you don't have it yet, paste this in a terminal prompt:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ruby &lt;<span class="o">(</span>curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-install-cairo">
<h2>Step 3 - Install Cairo</h2>
<p>In your terminal prompt, type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install cairo --use-clang
</pre></div>
<p>You'll get some messages about <cite>LDFLAGS</cite> and <cite>CPPFLAGS</cite> in build variables, but that's only important if you skip Homebrew and build your own software later that interacts with <strong>cairo</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4-install-pycairo-itself">
<h2>Step 4 - Install Pycairo itself</h2>
<p>The nasty little trick to this is to remember that <strong>Pycairo</strong> is packaged on it's site and other places as <strong>py2cairo</strong>. When they get around to releasing version 3 of Pycairo, I'm going to beg and plead that they follow an obvious naming system for their bundles. I know this is done in other communities, but it's frustrating and a real barrier for getting into a project.</p>
<p>In case, in your terminal prompt, type the following:</p>

<p>If you are using a non-Homebrew installed Python like I do, you have to set the PYTHONPATH to find pycairo.  Set your PYTHONPATH in your <cite>.bashrc/.profile/.whatever</cite> to the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">PYTHONPATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:<span class="nv">$PYTHONPATH</span>.
</pre></div>
<p>Yes, it's the system Python, but for now I'm okay with it. If someone has an easy recipe for alternative Python installations, I would love to link to it.</p>
