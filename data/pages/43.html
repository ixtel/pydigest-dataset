<h2>What are class-based views anyway?</h2>
<p>
Django's class-based generic views provide abstract classes
implementing common web development tasks. These are very powerful,
and heavily-utilise Python's object orientation and multiple
inheritance in order to be extensible. This means they're more than
just a couple of generic shortcuts — they provide utilities
which can be mixed into the much more complex views that you write
yourself.
</p>
<h2>Great! So what's the problem?</h2>
<p>
All of this power comes at the expense of simplicity. For example,
trying to work out exactly which method you need to customise, and
what its keyword arguments are, on your <code>UpdateView</code>
can feel a little like wading through spaghetti — it has 10
separate ancestors (plus <code>object</code>), spread across 3
different python files. This site shows you exactly what you need
to know.
</p>
<h2>How does this site help?</h2>
<p>
To make things easier, we've taken all the attributes and methods
that every view defines or inherits, and flattened all that
information onto one comprehensive page per view. Check out
<a href="/UpdateView/">UpdateView</a>,
for example.
