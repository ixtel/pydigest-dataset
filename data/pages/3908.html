      <h3 class="course-headline color-primary">If you have a project or a business you want to build, now is the time.</h3>
<p>Does it drive you crazy not to be able to build your own landing pages, splash pages, and interactive features? Are you still trying to find the perfect developer to make your project a reality?</p>
<p>It’s time to stop waiting.</p>
<p>Python and Django are tools you can learn, and you can learn them quickly. Over the past few years, entrepreneurs who have succeeded have typically had a blend of both business and technological prowess. The good news? It doesn’t take much to tip into the world of developers and become one of them yourself.</p>
<p>It’s not as hard as they say it is.</p>
<p>If your ideas are burning a hole in your notebook, and you’re ready to take it to the next level, you’ll learn how to convert concepts into code, and code into product.</p>
<p>Along the way I’ll share key skills and technologies to get the biggest splash out of the least work, preparing you for the engineering position or technical-founder role of your dreams.</p>
<p>Don't give up. You too can learn Python, Django, and how to build your next website or web-app based business. I first learned Python in the process of building my first company, DecisionDesk.</p>
<p>Also, I or someone on the team will personally respond to any questions you might have, so there’s no worry about getting stuck or not knowing what to do. So sign up now!</p>
<p>Looking forward to working with you,</p>
<p>Eric Neuman</p>
