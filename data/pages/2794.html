                <p>I'll start with a quiz. What does this function do?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lst</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">lst</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="n">i</span>

</pre></div>
<p>If you think "computes the sum and product of the items in <tt class="docutils literal">lst</tt>", don't feel
too bad about yourself. The bug here is often tricky to spot. If you did see it,
well done - but buried in mountains of real code, and when you don't <em>know</em> it's
a quiz, discovering the bug is significantly more difficult.</p>
<p>The bug here is due to using <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">t</tt> in the body of the second
<tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop. But wait, how does this even work? Shouldn't <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> be invisible
outside of the first loop? <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id1">[1]</a> Well, no. In fact, Python formally acknowledges
that the names defined as <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop targets (a more formally rigorous name
for "index variables") leak into the enclosing function scope. So this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]:</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Is valid and prints 3, by design. In this writeup I want to explore why this is
so, why it's unlikely to change, and also use it as a tracer bullet to dig into
some interesting parts of the CPython compiler.</p>
<p>And by the way, if you're not convinced this behavior can cause real problems,
consider this snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">lst</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">lst</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">lambda</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">lst</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you'd expect this to print <tt class="docutils literal">[0, 1, 2, 3]</tt>, no such luck. This code will,
instead, emit <tt class="docutils literal">[3, 3, 3, 3]</tt>, because there's just a single <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> in the scope
of <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt>, and this is what all the <tt class="docutils literal">lambda</tt>s capture.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-official-word">
<h2>The official word</h2>
<p>The Python reference documentation explicitly documents this behavior in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/dev/reference/compound_stmts.html#for">section on for loops</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
The for-loop makes assignments to the variables(s) in the target list. [...]
Names in the target list are not deleted when the loop is finished, but if
the sequence is empty, they will not have been assigned to at all by the
loop.</blockquote>
<p>Note the last sentence - let's try it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">[]:</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Indeed, a <tt class="docutils literal">NameError</tt> is raised. Later on, we'll see that this is a natural
outcome of the way the Python VM executes its bytecode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-this-is-so">
<h2>Why this is so</h2>
<p>I actually asked Guido van Rossum about this behavior and he was gracious enough
to reply with some historical background (thanks Guido!). The motivation is
keeping Python's simple approach to names and scopes without resorting to hacks
(such as deleting all the values defined in the loop after it's done - think
about the complications with exceptions, etc.) or more complex scoping rules.</p>
<p>In Python, the scoping rules are fairly simple and elegant: a block is either a
module, a function body or a class body. Within a function body, names are
visible from the point of their definition to the end of the block (including
nested blocks such as nested functions). That's for local names, of course;
global names (and other <em>nonlocal</em> names) have slightly different rules, but
that's not pertinent to our discussion.</p>
<p>The important point here is: the innermost possible scope is a function body.
Not a <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop body. Not a <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> block body. Python does not have nested
lexical scopes below the level of a function, unlike some other languages (C and
its progeny, for example).</p>
<p>So if you just go about implementing Python, this behavior is what you'll likely
to end with. Here's another enlightening snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">d</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Would it surprise you to find out that <tt class="docutils literal">d</tt> is visible and accessible after the
<tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop is finished? No, this is just the way Python works. So why would
the index variable be treated any differently?</p>
<p>By the way, the index variables of list comprehensions are also leaked to the
enclosing scope. Or, to be precise, <em>were</em> leaked, before Python 3 came along.</p>
<p>Python 3 fixed the leakage from list comprehensions, along with other breaking
changes. Make no mistake, changing such behavior is a major breakage in
backwards compatibility. This is why I think the current behavior stuck and
won't be changed.</p>
<p>Moreover, many folks still find this a useful feature of Python. Consider:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">enumerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">somegenerator</span><span class="p">()):</span>
    <span class="n">dostuffwith</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'The loop executed {0} times!'</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you have no idea how many items <tt class="docutils literal">somegenerator</tt> actually returned, this is
a pretty succinct way to know. Otherwise you'd have to keep a separate counter.</p>
<p>Here's another example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">somegenerator</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">isinteresing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
<span class="n">dostuffwith</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Which is a useful pattern for finding things in a loop and using them afterwards
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>There are other uses people came up with over the years that justify keeping
this behavior in place. It's hard enough to instill breaking changes for
features the core developers deem detrimental and harmful. When the feature is
argued by many to be useful, and moreover is used in a huge bunch of code in the
real world, the chances of removing it are zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="under-the-hood">
<h2>Under the hood</h2>
<p>Now the fun part. Let's see how the Python compiler and VM conspire to make this
behavior possible. In this particular case, I think the most lucid way to
present things is going backwards from the bytecode. I hope this may also serve
as an interesting example on how to go about digging in Python's internals <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id3">[3]</a>
in order to find stuff out (it's so much fun, seriously!)</p>
<p>Let's take a part of the function presented at the start of this article and
disassemble it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lst</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">lst</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">i</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The resulting bytecode is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> 0 LOAD_CONST               1 (0)
 3 STORE_FAST               1 (a)

 6 SETUP_LOOP              24 (to 33)
 9 LOAD_FAST                0 (lst)
12 GET_ITER
13 FOR_ITER                16 (to 32)
16 STORE_FAST               2 (i)

19 LOAD_FAST                1 (a)
22 LOAD_FAST                2 (i)
25 INPLACE_ADD
26 STORE_FAST               1 (a)
29 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           13
32 POP_BLOCK

33 LOAD_FAST                1 (a)
36 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>
<p>As a reminder, <tt class="docutils literal">LOAD_FAST</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">STORE_FAST</tt> are the opcodes Python uses to
access names that are only used within a function. Since the Python compiler
knows statically (at compile-time) how many such names exist in each function,
they can be accessed with static array offsets as opposed to a hash table, which
makes access significanly faster (hence the <tt class="docutils literal">_FAST</tt> suffix). But I digress.
What's really important here is that <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> are treated identically.
They are both fetched with <tt class="docutils literal">LOAD_FAST</tt> and modified with <tt class="docutils literal">STORE_FAST</tt>.
There is absolutely no reason to assume that their visibility is in any way
different <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>So how did this come to be? Somehow, the compiler figured that <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> is just
another local name within <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt>. This logic lives in the symbol table code,
when the compiler walks over the AST to create a control-flow graph from which
bytecode is later emitted; there are more details about this process in
<a class="reference external" href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/09/18/python-internals-symbol-tables-part-1">my article about symbol tables</a>
- so I'll just stick to the essentials here.</p>
<p>The symtable code doesn't treat <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statements very specially. In
<tt class="docutils literal">symtable_visit_stmt</tt> we have:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">For_kind</span>:
    <span class="n">VISIT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">st</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">For</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">target</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">VISIT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">st</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expr</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">For</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">iter</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">VISIT_SEQ</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">st</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stmt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">For</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">body</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">For</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">orelse</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">VISIT_SEQ</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">st</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stmt</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">For</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">orelse</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The loop target is visited as any other expression. Since this code visits the
AST, it's worthwhile to dump it to see how the node for the <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statement
looks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>For(target=Name(id='i', ctx=Store()),
    iter=Name(id='lst', ctx=Load()),
    body=[AugAssign(target=Name(id='a', ctx=Store()),
                    op=Add(),
                    value=Name(id='i', ctx=Load()))],
    orelse=[])
</pre></div>
<p>So <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> lives in a <tt class="docutils literal">Name</tt> node. These are handled in the symbol table code by
the following clause in <tt class="docutils literal">symtable_visit_expr</tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">Name_kind</span>:
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="n">symtable_add_def</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">st</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span>
                          <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ctx</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">Load</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="n">USE</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">DEF_LOCAL</span><span class="p">))</span>
        <span class="n">VISIT_QUIT</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">st</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="cm">/* ... */</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Since the name <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> is clearly tagged with <tt class="docutils literal">DEF_LOCAL</tt> (because of the
<tt class="docutils literal">*_FAST</tt> opcodes emitted to access it, but this is also easy to observe if the
symbol table is dumped using the <tt class="docutils literal">symtable</tt> module), the code above evidently
calls <tt class="docutils literal">symtable_add_def</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">DEF_LOCAL</tt> as the third argument. This is
the right time to glance at the AST above and notice the <tt class="docutils literal">ctx=Store</tt> part
of the <tt class="docutils literal">Name</tt> node of <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>. So it's the AST that already comes in carrying
the information that <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> is stored to in the <tt class="docutils literal">target</tt> part of the <tt class="docutils literal">For</tt>
node. Let's see how that comes to be.</p>
<p>The AST-building part of the compiler goes over the parse tree (which is a
fairly low-level hierarchical representation of the source code - some
background is available <a class="reference external" href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/02/16/abstract-vs-concrete-syntax-trees">here</a>)
and, among other things, sets the <tt class="docutils literal">expr_context</tt> attributes on some nodes,
most notably <tt class="docutils literal">Name</tt> nodes. Think about it this way, in the following
statement:</p>

<p>Both <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">bar</tt> are going to end up in <tt class="docutils literal">Name</tt> nodes. But while
<tt class="docutils literal">bar</tt> is only being loaded from, <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> is actually being stored into in this
code. The <tt class="docutils literal">expr_context</tt> attribute is used to distinguish between uses for
later consumption by the symbol table code <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id5">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Back to our <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop targets, though. These are handled in the function that
creates an AST for <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> statements -  <tt class="docutils literal">ast_for_for_stmt</tt>. Here are the
relevant parts of this function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">stmt_ty</span>
<span class="nf">ast_for_for_stmt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">compiling</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">const</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Store</tt> context is created in the call to <tt class="docutils literal">ast_for_exprlist</tt>, which
creates the node for the target (recall the the <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop target may be a
sequence of names for tuple unpacking, not just a single name).</p>
<p>This function is probably the most important part in the process of explaining
why <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop targets are treated similarly to other names <em>within</em> the loop.
After this tagging happens in the AST, the code for handling such names in the
symbol table and VM is no different from other names.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>This article discusses a particular behavior of Python that may be considered a
"gotcha" by some. I hope the article does a decent job of explaining how this
behavior flows naturally from the naming and scoping semantics of Python, why
it can be useful and hence is unlikely to ever change, and how the internals of
