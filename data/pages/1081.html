We’re not just trying to find the shortest distance; we also want to take into account travel time. Move the blob (start point) and “X” (end point) to see the shortest path.</p><p id="diagram-intro" class="intro-diagram"/><p>To find this path we can use a <em>graph search</em> algorithm, which works when the map is represented as a graph. <strong>A*</strong> is a popular choice for graph search. <strong>Breadth First Search</strong> is the simplest of the graph search algorithms, so let’s start there, and we’ll work our way up to A*.</p></div><div class="topic"><p>The first thing to do when studying an algorithm is to understand the <strong>data</strong>. What is the input? What is the output?</p><p><strong>Input:</strong> Graph search algorithms, including A*, take a “graph” as input. A graph is a set of <em>locations</em> (“nodes”) and the <em>connections</em> (“edges”) between them. Here’s the graph I gave to A*:</p><div><img alt="Different map with the same pathfinding graph" src="same-graph-different-map.jpg"/><p>Sprites by StarRaven<br/>see footer for link</p><p id="diagram-graphs1-under" class="intro-diagram"/><p id="diagram-graphs1-over" class="intro-diagram"/></div><p>A* doesn’t see anything else. It only sees the graph. It doesn’t know whether something is indoors or outdoors, or if it’s a room or a doorway, or how big an area is. <em>It only sees the graph!</em> It doesn’t know the difference between this map <button class="hover" id="show-graphs1-different-map">this other one</button>.</p><p><strong>Output:</strong> The path found by A* is <button class="hover" id="show-graphs1-path-trace">made of graph nodes and edges</button>. The edges are abstract mathematical concepts. A* will tell you to move from one location to another <em>but it won’t tell you how</em>. Remember that it doesn’t know anything about rooms or doors; all it sees is the graph. You’ll have to decide whether a graph edge returned by A* means moving from tile to tile or walking in a straight line or opening a door or swimming or running along a curved path.</p><p><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong> For any given game map, there are many different ways of making a pathfinding graph to give to A*. The above map makes most doorways into nodes; what if we made <button class="hover" id="show-graphs2-waypoints">doorways into edges</button>? What if we used <button class="hover" id="show-graphs2-grid">a pathfinding grid</button>?</p><p>The pathfinding graph doesn’t have to be the same as what your game map uses. A grid game map can use a non-grid pathfinding graph, or vice versa. A* runs fastest with the fewest graph nodes; grids are often easier to work with but result in lots of nodes. This page covers the A* algorithm but not graph design; see <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/MapRepresentations.html">my other page</a> for more about graphs. For the explanations on the rest of the page, <em>I’m going to use grids because it’s easier to visualize the concepts</em>.</p></div><div class="topic"><p>The key idea for all of these algorithms is that we keep track of an expanding ring called the <em class="frontier">frontier</em>. This process is sometimes called “flood fill”. <strong>Start the animation</strong> to see how the frontier expands:</p><p id="diagram0a" class="color-frontier"/><p>How do we implement this? Repeat these steps until the frontier is empty:</p><ol><li>Pick and remove <span class="current">a location</span> from the <span class="frontier">frontier</span>.</li><li>Mark the location as <span class="visited">visited</span> so that we know not to process it again.</li><li><em>Expand</em> it by looking at its <span class="next">neighbors</span>. Any neighbors we haven’t we haven’t seen yet we add to the <span class="frontier">frontier</span>.</li></ol><p>Let’s see this up close. The tile are numbered in the order we visit them. <strong>Step through to see the expansion process:</strong></p><p id="diagram1" class="color-frontier color-current"/><p>It’s only ten lines of (Python) code:</p><pre>
frontier = Queue()
frontier.put(start)
visited = {}
visited[start] = True

while not frontier.empty():
   current = frontier.get()
   for next in graph.neighbors(current):
      if next not in visited:
         frontier.put(next)
         visited[next] = True</pre><p>This loop is the essence of the graph search algorithms on this page, including A*. But how do we find the shortest path? The loop doesn’t actually construct the paths; it only tells us how to visit everything on the map. That’s because Breadth First Search can be used for a lot more than just finding paths; in <a href="../tower-defense/">this article</a> I show how it’s used for tower defense, but it can also be used for distance maps, procedural map generation, and lots of other things. Here though we want to use it for finding paths, so let’s modify the loop to keep track of <em>where we came from</em> for every location that’s visited, and rename <code class="visited">visited</code> to <code class="came_from">came_from</code>:</p><pre>
frontier = Queue()
frontier.put(start)
<em>came_from</em> = {}
<em>came_from</em>[start] = <em>None</em>

while not frontier.empty():
   current = frontier.get()

      if next not in <em>came_from</em>:
         frontier.put(next)
         <em>came_from</em>[next] = <em>current</em></pre><p>Now <span class="came_from">came_from</span> for each location points to the place where we came from. That’s enough to reconstruct the entire path. Mouse over any location on the map and see how following the arrows gives you a reverse path back to the start position.</p><p id="diagram2"/><p>The code to reconstruct paths is simple: <em>follow the arrows</em></p><pre>
current = goal
path = [current]
while current != start:
   current = came_from[current]
   path.append(current)
path.reverse()</pre><p>That’s the simplest pathfinding algorithm. It works not only on grids as shown here but on any sort of graph structure. In a dungeon, graph locations could be rooms and graph edges the doorways between them. In a platformer, graph locations could be locations and graph edges the possible actions such as move left, move right, jump up, jump down. In general, think of the graph as states and actions that change state. I have more written about map representation <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/MapRepresentations.html">here</a>. In the rest of the article I’ll continue using examples with grids, and explore why you might use variants of breadth first search.</p></div><div class="topic"><p>We’ve found paths from <em>one</em> location to <em>all</em> other locations.

In some pathfinding scenarios there are different costs for different types of movement. For example in Civilization, moving through plains or desert might cost 1 move-point but moving through forest or hills might cost 5 move-points. In the map at the top of the page, walking through water cost 10 times as much as walking through grass. Another example is diagonal movement on a grid that costs more than axial movement. We’d like the pathfinder to take these costs into account. Let’s compare the <em>number of steps</em> from the start with the <em>distance</em> from the start:</p><p>We want <strong>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</strong> for this. How does it differ from Breadth First Search? We need to track movement costs, so let’s add a new variable, <span class="cost_so_far">cost_so_far</span>, to keep track of the total movement cost from the start location. We want to take the movement costs into account when deciding how to evaluate locations; let’s turn our queue into a priority queue. Less obviously, we may end up visiting a location multiple times, with different costs, so we need to alter the logic a little bit. Instead of adding a location to the frontier if the location has never been visited, we’ll add it if the new path to the location is better than the best previous path.</p><pre>

Contour lines are one way to see this. <strong>Start the animation</strong> to see how the frontier expands more slowly through the forests, finding the shortest path around the central forest instead of through it:</p><div id="diagram-dijkstra" class="color-frontier"><p id="diagram-dijkstra-unweighted">Breadth First Search<br/></p><p id="diagram-dijkstra-weighted">Dijkstra’s Algorithm<br/></p></div><p>Movement costs other than 1 allow us to explore more interesting graphs, not only grids. In the map at the top of the page, movement costs were based on the distance from room to room. Movement costs can also be used to avoid or prefer areas based on proximity to enemies or allies.</p><p>An implementation detail: a regular priority queue supports insert and remove operations, but some presentations of Dijkstra’s Algorithm also use a third operation, to modify the priority of an element already in the priority queue. I don’t use that operation, and explain why on the <a href="implementation.html">implementation notes page</a>.</p></div><div class="topic"><p>With Breadth First Search and Dijkstra’s Algorithm, the frontier expands in all directions. This is a reasonable choice if you’re trying to find a path to all locations or to many locations. However, a common case is to find a path to only one location. Let’s make the frontier expand towards the goal more than it expands in other directions. First, we’ll define a <em>heuristic</em> function that tells us how close we are to the goal:</p><pre>
def heuristic(a, b):
   # Manhattan distance on a square grid
   return abs(a.x - b.x) + abs(a.y - b.y)</pre><p>In Dijkstra’s Algorithm we used the actual distance from the <em>start</em> for the priority queue ordering. Here instead, in <strong>Greedy Best First Search</strong>, we’ll use the estimated distance to the <em>goal</em> for the priority queue ordering.

As long as the heuristic does not overestimate distances, A* does <em>not</em> use the heuristic to come up with an approximate answer. It finds an optimal path, like Dijkstra’s Algorithm does.

If you’re implementing it yourself, I have <a href="implementation.html">companion guide</a> that shows step by step how to implement graphs, queues, and pathfinding algorithms in Python, C++, and C#.</p><p>Which algorithm should you use for finding paths on a game map?</p><ul><li>If you want to find paths from or to <em>all</em> all locations, use Breadth First Search or Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

Prefer A* in most cases. When you’re tempted to use Greedy Best First Search, consider using A* with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic">“inadmissible” heuristic</a>.</li></ul><p>What about optimal paths? Breadth First Search and Dijkstra’s Algorithm are guaranteed to find the shortest path given the input graph. Greedy Best First Search is not. A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path if the heuristic is never larger than the true distance. As the heuristic becomes smaller, A* turns into Dijkstra’s Algorithm. As the heuristic becomes larger, A* turns into Greedy Best First Search.</p><p>What about performance? The best thing to do is to eliminate unnecessary locations in your graph. If using a grid, <a href="../grids/algorithms.html">see this</a>. Reducing the size of the graph helps all the graph search algorithms. After that, use the simplest algorithm you can; simpler queues run faster. Greedy Best First Search typically runs faster than Dijkstra’s Algorithm but doesn’t produce optimal paths. A* is a good choice for most pathfinding needs.</p><p>What about non-maps? I show maps here because I think it’s easier to understand how the algorithms work by using a map. However, these graph search algorithms can be used on any sort of graph, not only game maps, and I’ve tried to present the algorithm code in a way that’s independent of 2d grids. Movement costs on the maps become arbitrary weights on graph edges. The heuristics don’t translate as easily to arbitrary maps; you have to design a heuristic for each type of graph. For planar maps, distances are a good choice, so that’s what I’ve used here.</p><p>I have lots more written about pathfinding <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/">here</a>. Keep in mind that graph search is only one part of what you will need. A* doesn’t itself handle things like cooperative movement, moving obstacles, map changes, evaluation of dangerous areas, formations, turn radius, object sizes, animation, path smoothing, or lots of other topics.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
