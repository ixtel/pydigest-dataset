A Python 3 book for the future

<h3 class="tr1">
My book "Porting to Python 3" needs updating, but I don't have time. This campaign is to make this into a book where everyone can contribute.

<h1>Supporting Python 3</h1>
<p>In 2011 I published a book on how to update your Python 2 code to Python 3, and published it for free on <a href="http://python3porting.com/">http://python3porting.com/</a>. It's also been available in paper and PDF versions.</p>
<p>I updated it in 2013, but for next year it should really get another update, as there are new libraries such as "Future" and "Modernize" which aren't covered in the book, and because the best strategy for supporting Python 3 has changed with Python 2.5 and 3.2 both becoming practically obsolete for most people.</p>
<p>But I have a job now, so I don't have time to do update it. The money I make from the book also in no way covers the effort I have put into the book, and need to put into it.</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>I therefore want to make the book into a community book, and let the community update it. But that is not without effort either. The current repository is a mess, and the knowledge of how to make it into a book resides entirely inside my head. Therefore I created this campaign, to get some funding to make this happen.</p>
<p>The minimum needed for this campaign is €400 and the maximum is €2500.</p>
<h1>The Steps</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first step is to clean up the code, document how to generate the HTML for the site, and move the code to Github. This will happen if the campaign reaches it's minimum goal of €400. At this point the book can recieve contributions from others in the form of pull requests, so it can be updated. <strong>UPDATE: This goal is reached!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next step is to make it into a real community book. For that I will rename the book into "Supporting Python 3", create a contributor licensing scheme and update the "About this book" page to reflect the books community status and contributors. This I will do if the campaign reaches €800. <strong>UPDATE: This goal is reached!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code in the book has extensive tests. A service can be set up to automatically run these tests each time somebody changes something. If the tests run the website and PDF's could also be created automatically and uploaded to the website. I will set up these scripts if the campaign reaches €1200.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the book is up to date, it can be potentially used as a source of income. It was for example given away in the "goodie bag" of EuroPython 2013, sponsored by Enquos. If the campaign reaches €2500 I will give the Python Software Foundation a license to publish the book commercially, so the PSF can make money on it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The work will be done during the winter and spring of 2015, and the rewards will be delivered sometime during 2015.</p>
