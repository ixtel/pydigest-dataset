<p>As proud sponsors of PyCon, we hosted a one and a half hour free workshop. We see the workshops as a wonderful opportunity to share some practical, hands-on experience in our area of expertise: building applications in Django. In addition, it’s a way to give back to the open source community. </p>
<p>This year, Technical Director <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/about/mark-lavin/">Mark Lavin</a> and Developers <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/about/caleb-smith/">Caleb Smith</a> and <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/about/david-ray/">David Ray</a> presented “Building SMS Applications with Django.” In the workshop, they taught the basics of SMS application development using Django and Django-based RapidSMS. Aside from covering the basic anatomy of an SMS-based application, as well as building SMS workflows and testing SMS applications, Mark, David, and Caleb were able to bring their practical experience with Caktus client projects to the table. </p>
<p>We’ve used SMS on behalf of international aid organizations and agencies like UNICEF as a cost-effective and pervasive method for conveying urgent information. We’ve built tools to <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2015/06/12/stanford-social-innovation-review-highlights-caktus-work-libya/">help Libyans register to vote via SMS</a>, <a href="https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2014/09/19/rapidsms-africa/">deliver critical infant HIV/AIDs results</a> in Zambia and Malawi, and alert humanitarian workers of danger in and around Syria. </p>
