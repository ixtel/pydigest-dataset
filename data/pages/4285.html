    <p>I am super-excited to announce that the book I've been working on for more than the last year, <i>Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python</i> is finally available! (buy from <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do">O'Reilly</a>, use discount code AUTHD to save some money) (buy from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Scratch-Principles-Python/dp/149190142X">Amazon</a>).</p>
<p>My experience learning and teaching data science was that there were two primary paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Math Path: "So you want to be a data scientist? Sure, the first thing you need to know is <i>matrix decompositions</i>. How well do you remember your measure theory?"</li>
<li>The Tools Path: "So you want to be a data scientist? Great, here's the most important libraries to know.  How well do you know R?"</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I am myself a "math person", the first approach never resonated with me.  The fun of data science for me has always been <i>working with data</i>.  At the same time, I've never been thrilled with the second approach -- it's a good way to start doing data science without ever really understanding what you're doing.  </p>
<p>My ideal would be a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way">third way</a>" between these approaches: </p>
<ol>
<li>understanding the behavior of the most common tools by working through a solid-but-less-than-textbook-rigorous understanding of the math behind them, and</li>
<li>implementing simplified versions of them <i>from scratch</i> to understand exactly what it is they're doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hence <i>Data Science from Scratch</i>.  It's got math, but only as much as is totally necessary.  It's got scraping and cleaning and munging.  It's got machine learning.  It's got databases and MapReduce.  Necessarily it doesn't go <i>deep</i> into any of these, but I like to think it establishes a broad, solid foundation for someone who knows some math and some programming but is not (necessarily) an expert at either.</p>
<p>Many technical books (I won't name names) explain things in their text and then dump pages of hard-to-follow code at you that you are expected to puzzle through.  I spent a lot of time trying to write clean code that illuminated the concepts <i>on its own</i> and that <i>reinforced</i> the ideas from the text.  As is the current fashion these days, all of the code and data is <a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch">on GitHub</a>, if you'd like to get a sense of what the book is about.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the topic, I encourage you to check it out, write a review, and let me know what you think!  (You can see the full table of contents on the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do">O'Reilly page</a>.)</p>
