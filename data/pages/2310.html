I recently read (and tweeted) a funny post

which compared languages and cars. It suggested that

</li><li> C++ (see above) is the new C - twice the power, twice the size, works in hostile environments, and if you try to use it without care and special training you will probably crash.

Continuing along this line of thought, what would be the main

Data Science Languages: R, Python, SAS, and SQL?</a>

I can think of R as a flying car - very powerful, but only experts can handle it.

SQL, born in 1970s, would be a classic 1970-s Ford Mustang. 
No modern gizmos, but still fast and reliable, if properly maintained.

SAS may be a corporate luxury car - perhaps a Lincoln Continental or Mercedes.
Great car, but expensive.

What would be your nominations for languages as cars? And if SQL is a Mustang, what then is NoSQL?
