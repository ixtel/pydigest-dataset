<p>Yet again, myself, Audrey Roy, and a small but elite cadre of volunteers are feverishly at work putting together another Los Angeles open source event. Our <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/july-15th-2012-la-open-source-recap.html">last effort went smashingly well</a>, and like any good engineer, we're ready to scale up - this time to 150 attendees!</p>
<p>LA Open Source #5 is a day long coding event for Open Source developers of all languages and skill levels to come and code like fiends. They'll be joined by dozens of either really smart coders or nice people like me. Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and more!</p>
<p>RSVP at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/">http://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/</a></p>
<p>I'll be there to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Co-lead the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles technical community!</li>
<li>Code like a fiend. I plan to work on core <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>. Maybe some ember.js stuff too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now to open the floor to questions...</p>

<div class="section" id="what-if-i-don-t-have-a-project-of-my-own-to-bring-should-i-come">
<h2>What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?</h2>
<p>Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join and contribute to in order to make the world a better place. The current list of projects include things like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Django - in fact, this time we've got at least one core Django developer!</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Rails</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Pyramid</li>
<li>Salt Stack</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
<li>PHP</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="i-m-just-starting-as-a-developer-should-i-come">
<h2>I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?</h2>
<p>It depends.</p>
<p><strong>If you've never coded before</strong>, this isn't the right place. Instead, you might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In fact, here's a good <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/">bi-weekly hack night / study group</a> for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you've done a tutorial or two</strong>, sprints can be a great way to learn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced developers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have what are called 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for beginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at events like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other things that have made me a better coder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-come-and-do-one-of-the-following">
<h2>Can I come and do one of the following:</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Recruit.</li>
<li>Get people to work on my private project.</li>
<li>Get people to work on my start-up idea.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>This is not a job fair or way to get free developers services, and we don't want unnecessary distractions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we mention you on the official event description, in social media and many other perks. Please contact us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:sponsors@laopensource.org">sponsors@laopensource.org</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, we're considering future events that mix in business into our efforts. If you're interested in that sort of thing then stay tuned for more announcements.</p>
