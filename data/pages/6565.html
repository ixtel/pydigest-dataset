  <p>This week, we’re excited to announce that Semaphore now officially supports
continuous integration and deployment of your Python applications.</p>

<h3>Python: Always look on the bright side of your code</h3>

<p>Python, famously named after the BBC comedy series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”,
is a powerful high-level open source programming language supporting multiple
programming paradigms including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming.
Due to its clean, simple and readable syntax, it is one of the most popular programming
languages, ranked as the fifth most popular language in the
<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE Programming Community Index</a>.</p>

<p>It has a comprehensive <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/">standard library</a>
which describes all the components which are shipped with the language. This
reflects the design philisophy which Python is built on. A small core which is
easily extensible. <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>(Python Package Index)
hosts thousands of packages (called wheels), and this number is growing rapidly.
PyPI packages make it easy to add a wide variety of functionalities to applications
without reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>True to its name’s origin, Python aims to make the language fun to use on all
levels and to maximize user-friendliness.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Continuous Integration for a Python project</h2>

<p>Once you’ve <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/users/sign_up">signed up</a> for a Semaphore
account, you can add a Python project to Semaphore. Semaphore supports both
GitHub and BitBucket.</p>

<p><img alt="Setting up CI for a Python project on Semaphore" src="https://semaphoreci.com/blog/assets/images/2015-09-03/django_repo_host.png"/></p>

<p>Choosing your project and branch will launch a short analysis in which Semaphore
determines the configuration of your project. These suggested build commands and
language settings can be changed at any time in Project Settings.</p>

<p>Semaphore supports a number of Python versions which are living in their own
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtual environment</a>. Every version has
a set of packages pre-installed. These include <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a>,
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock">mock</a>, <a href="http://pytest.org/latest/">pytest</a>,
and <a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">nose</a>. Packages installed with pip
are cached and <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/docs/caching-between-builds.html">reused between builds</a>,
drastically improving build times.</p>

<p>Completing the setup will launch the first build of your project.</p>

<p>To set up continuous deployment for your Python project, you can follow
our tutorial that covers
<a href="https://semaphoreci.com/docs/continuous-integration-deployment-django-with-github-semaphore-heroku.html">continuous deployment of a Django application to Heroku</a>.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to see the things you make with Python and Semaphore. Happy building!</p>
