				<p>We are big fans of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> here at MonkeyLearn. We read HN on a daily basis, but not all of us have the same interests; some are more interested news related to programming, and others are more interested in news related to startup and business.</p>
<p>So, what if we can read Hacker News but only see relevant news related to our interests?</p>
<p>This is why we created <a title="My Hacker News" href="http://hackernews.demos.monkeylearn.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>My Hacker News</em></strong></a>, a demo that classifies Hacker News posts with MonkeyLearn, you can check it out here: <a title="My Hacker News" href="http://hackernews.demos.monkeylearn.com" target="_blank">http://hackernews.demos.monkeylearn.com</a></p>
<p><span>By using </span><em>My Hacker News demo</em><span>, users can see HN top news classified with categories like ‘programming’, ‘business’, ‘design’, ‘entertainment’ and more. The interesting thing is that you can </span><strong><em>filter</em></strong><span> HN news based on the </span><strong><em>category you are interested.</em></strong><span> For example, if you are only interested in programming, you just click on ‘programming’ tab and voilà; you see only HN posts related to javascript, python, docker, elasticsearch and other programming related content.</span></p>
<h2><strong>How we built My Hacker News?</strong></h2>
<p>We used MonkeyLearn to <strong><em>train</em></strong> a machine learning categorizer with categories like ‘programming’, ‘business’, ‘science’, and downloaded <strong><em>samples</em></strong> from relevant sub-reddits to do the training.</p>
<p>The plot at the top shows you the distribution of categories for each hour, and you can filter the news by category.</p>
<p>The actual classifier is <strong><em>public</em></strong> so anyone can use it with a free MonkeyLearn account: <a href="https://app.monkeylearn.com/accounts/login/?next=/categorizer/projects/cl_GLSChuJQ/" target="_blank">https://app.monkeylearn.com/accounts/login/?next=/categorizer/projects/cl_GLSChuJQ/</a></p>
<p>The source code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/monkeylearn/hackernews" target="_blank">https://github.com/monkeylearn/hackernews</a></p>
<p>Every five minutes the app polls the HN API to categorize the latest submissions.</p>
<p>Although it is just a demo, we would love to hear your thoughts on it and how we can make it better. Any comment and suggestion is welcome!</p>
