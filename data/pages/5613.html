<p>I am having a hard time trying to configure tests running in PyCharm.</p>

<p>I want to run tests for my custom django apps, so my configuration looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vN0ex.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/vN0ex.png" alt="Django apps in options field"/></a></p>

<p>It works okay mostly (tests run, succeed), though it doesn't let you re-run individual tests and re-run failed ones - it always runs all tests for specified applications (common and authorization).</p>

<p>The manual says I should put django application names in "Target" field like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7zGZ8.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/7zGZ8.png" alt="Django apps in Target field"/></a></p>

<p>But whenever I do it, my tests fail to run with weird errors: sometimes it cannot import some modules, though they are definitely accessible, sometimes there are a lot of NoReverseFound exceptions, though none of them are actually present in the code.</p>

<p>I suppose I am configuring something wrong, but I cannot understand what. I am running the latest version of PyCharm and one of the 1.5.x versions of Django (some legacy code from back in the day I had to maintain)</p>

<p><strong>UPD</strong>: If I put <code>authorization.UserApiTestCase.test_login</code> in target - it works great, <code>authorization.UserApiTestCase</code> works too, but putting just appname (<code>authorization</code>) won't work and will produce NoReversrMatch or import errors... leaving Target empty will work, too, though it will run even iinternal Django tests and that's not what I need - I just want to run all my apps' tests (or tests from specific apps).</p>
