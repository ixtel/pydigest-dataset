“…I stood up slowly, turned around and took three, clear photos. There is something about crushing a little kid’s dream that gets me really angry. It takes three words to make a difference: “That’s not cool.” Yesterday the future of programming was on the line and I made myself heard.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
But Hank had already been called into his boss's office and fired.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
<strong>***</strong></p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“I packed up all my stuff in a box,” Hank said, “then I went outside to call my wife. I’m not one to shed tears but…” Hank paused. “When I got in the car with my wife I just… I’ve got three kids. Getting fired was terrifying.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
That night Hank made his only public statement (he had never spoken to a journalist about what had happened before he spoke to me). He posted a short message on the discussion board Hacker News:</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Hi, I’m the guy who made a comment about big dongles. First of all I’d like to say I’m sorry. I really did not mean to offend anyone and I really do regret the comment and how it made Adria feel.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“She had every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position. [But] as a result of the picture she took I was let go from my job today. Which sucks because I have three kids and I really liked that job.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“She gave me no warning, she smiled while she snapped the pic and sealed my fate.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“The next day,” Hank said, “Adria Richards called my company asking them to ask me to remove the portion of my apology that stated I lost my job as a result of her tweet.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
<strong>***</strong></p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
I sent Adria an interview request. “All right, pitch me via email and if relevant, I’ll respond,” she replied. So I pitched. Successfully. We agreed to meet two weeks later. “We will meet in a public place for safety reasons,” Adria wrote. “Make sure to bring along your ID for verification.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
We settled on the international check-in desks at San Francisco Airport. I was expecting someone fiercer. But when I saw her half wave at me from across the terminal she didn’t seem fierce at all. She seemed introverted and delicate, just like how Hank had come across over the Google Hangout. We found a cafe and she told me about the moment it all began for her — the moment she overheard the comment about the big dongle.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Have you ever had an altercation at school and you could feel the hairs rise up on your back?” she asked me.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“You felt fear?” I asked.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Danger,” she said. “Clearly my body was telling me, ‘You are unsafe.’”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
Which was why, she said, she “slowly stood up, rotated from my hips, and took three photos.” She tweeted one, “with a very brief summary of what they said. Then I sent another tweet describing my location. Right? And then the third tweet was the [conference's] code of conduct.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“You talked about danger," I said. "What were you imagining might...?"</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Have you ever heard that thing, men are afraid that women will laugh at them and women are afraid that men will kill them?” she said.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
I told Adria that people might consider that an overblown thing to say. She had, after all, been in the middle of a tech conference with 800 bystanders.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Sure,” Adria replied. “And those people would probably be white and they would probably be male.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
This seemed a weak gambit. Men can sometimes be correct. There is some Latin for this kind of logical fallacy. It’s called an ad hominem attack. When someone can’t defend a criticism against them, they change the subject by attacking the criticiser.</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Somebody getting fired is pretty bad,” I said. “I know you didn’t call for him to be fired. But you must have felt pretty bad.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Not too bad,” she said. She thought more and shook her head decisively. “He’s a white male. I’m a black Jewish female. He was saying things that could be inferred as offensive to me, sitting in front of him. I do have empathy for him but it only goes so far. If he had Down’s Syndrome and he accidently pushed someone off a subway that would be different... I’ve seen things where people are like, ‘Adria didn’t know what she was doing by tweeting it.’ Yes, I did.”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
“Hank’s actions resulted in him getting fired, yet he framed it in a way to blame me. If I had two kids, I wouldn’t tell ‘jokes’”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
The evening Hank posted his statement on Hacker News, outsiders began to involve themselves in his and Adria’s story. Hank started to receive messages of support from men’s-rights bloggers. He didn’t respond to any of them. Later, a Gucci Little Piggy blogger wrote that Hank’s Hacker News message had revealed him to be a man with: “a complete lack of backbone… by apologising you are just saying, ‘I am a weak enemy – do with me what you will.’ [In publicly shaming Hank, Adria had] complete and utter power over his children. That doesn’t piss this guy off?”</p><p class="body-el-text standard-body-el-text">
At the same time that Hank was being feted and then insulted by the men’s-rights bloggers, Adria discovered she was getting discussed on a famous meeting place for trolls: 4chan/b/.</p></div></div></body></html>
