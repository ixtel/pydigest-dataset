<span><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Hand-Tracking-Mechanical-Arm-Pyduino-Leap-Motion/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank">Hand Tracking Mechanical Arm - Pyduino + Leap Motion</a></span><br/>
This tutorial shows you how to assemble a hand tracking mechanical arm with a Leap Motion Controller, Arduino device, a few motors, some balsa wood, paper clips, hot glue and a little python code.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://rayli.net/blog/data/top-10-data-mining-algorithms-in-plain-english/" target="_blank">Top 10 data mining algorithms in plain English</a></span><br/>
A great and simple explanation of the top 10 most influential data mining algorithms. Once you know what they are, how they work, what they do and where you can find them, you'll have this post as a springboard to learn even more about data mining.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part3/" target="_blank">Let's Build A Web Server. Part 3.</a></span><br/>
In Part 2 you created a minimalistic WSGI server that could handle basic HTTP GET requests. And I asked you a question, "How can you make your server handle more than one request at a time?" In this article you will find the answer. So, buckle up and shift into high gear. You're about to have a really fast ride. Have your Linux, Mac OS X (or any *nix system) and Python ready. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://beta.oreilly.com/learning/analyzing-data-with-python" target="_blank">Analyzing Data with Python</a></span><br/>
In this talk led by Sarah Guido, you'll get a bird's eye overview of some of the best tools for data analysis and how you can apply them to your workflow.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/show/8/teaching-python-at-grok-learning-and-classrooms" target="_blank">Episode #8: Teaching Python at Grok Learning and Classrooms</a></span><br/>
Did you know that Australia is making text-based computer programming a core requirement for high school students? Grok Learning is building the platform to make teaching it to kids a joy for teachers and students. Our guest, Dr. James Curran is a key player in both of these projects.  Join Michael in a conversation with Dr. Curran from Sydney University and co-founder of Grok Learning to learn about both of these and more! You'll learn about the different types of online tutorials, or short courses, you can use for learning or teaching including a text-based MUD game! <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://podcastinit.com/episode-6-jonathan-slenders-talks-about-prompt-toolkit.html" target="_blank">Podcast.__init__  Episode 6</a></span> <br/>

<span><a href="http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/643786/7dbcc64524d979b1/" target="_blank">Python coroutines with async and await</a></span><br/>
It is already possible to create coroutines for asynchronous processing in Python. But a recent proposal would elevate coroutines to a full-fledged language construct, rather than treat them as a type of generator as they are currently. Two new keywords, async and await, would be added to the language to support coroutines as first-class Python features.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pP4EwWJgIU" target="_blank">Comparing machine learning models in scikit-learn</a></span><br/>
We've learned how to train different machine learning models and make predictions, but how do we actually choose which model is "best"? We'll cover the train/test split process for model evaluation, which allows you to avoid "overfitting" by estimating how well a model is likely to perform on new data. We'll use that same process to locate optimal tuning parameters for a KNN model, and then we'll re-train our model so that it's ready to make real predictions.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://blog.fanout.io/2015/05/20/building-a-realtime-api-with-rethinkdb/" target="_blank">Building a realtime API with RethinkDB</a></span><br/>
One of its standout features of RethinkDB is called Changefeeds. Applications can query tables for ongoing changes, and RethinkDB will push any changes to applications as they happen.  In this article, we'll describe how to use RethinkDB to implement a leaderboard API with realtime updates. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://hackingdistributed.com/2015/05/20/hyperdex-flask/" target="_blank">Writing A Web Application with Flask and HyperDex</a></span><br/>
In this post, we will explore how to build a prototypical web application using Flask with HyperDex. Specifically, this post will examine how to create a simple discussion board. In a series of blog posts, we'll build up to a discussion forum where people can log in with their OAuth credentials and post comments. Ultimately, we'll build a cryptocurrency exchange backed by HyperDex and Flask.<br/>

The book starts by introducing you to setting up your essential data science toolbox. Then it will guide you across all the data munging and preprocessing phases. This will be done in a manner that explains all the core data science activities related to loading data, transforming and fixing it for analysis, as well as exploring and processing it. Finally, it will complete the overview by presenting you with the main machine learning algorithms, the graph analysis technicalities, and all the visualization instruments that can make your life easier in presenting your results.<br/>
