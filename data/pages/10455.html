  <p>This post is a brief repetition of <a href="http://vknight.org/unpeudemath/pedagogy/2015/02/13/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/">this post from last
year</a>
detailing results from the 16 person knock out <a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock">Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</a> tournament we played the other day.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with <a href="http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock">Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock</a> this is a good video that explains it:</p>

<p>Here is how the game went (thanks to Geraint for noting everything down and Saniya for grabbing the pictures!):</p>

<p>Here is a plot of the strategies played during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rounds:</p>

<p>The overall strategy profile played is here:</p>

<p><strong>Exactly like last year</strong> we are not exactly at Nash equilibria.
In fact it seems that Scissors and Rock are being played a bit more often, so someone entering in to this game should respond by playing Spock (he vaporises Rock and smashes Scissors).</p>

<p>Here are the strategies that at some point won a duel:</p>

<p>and here are the losing strategies:</p>

<p>Hopefully my class found this interesting and fun.</p>
