							<h1 class="title">Cubes 1.0 Released - Pluggable Data Warehouse</h1>

							<p>Finally it is here: Cubes 1.0. Many of you are already using it from
<a href="https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes">Github</a> or from PyPi, it just has not
been officially released, so here we go.</p>
<p>Cubes now brings a light-weight way to create concept-oriented pluggable data
warehouse from multipe sources.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Analytical Workspace and Model Providers</li>
<li>Model Objects Redesign</li>
<li>HTTP API changes</li>
<li>New Backends</li>
<li>New SQL Backend Features</li>
<li>Authentication and Authorization</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://pythonhosted.org/cubes/releases/1.0.html">Detailed list of changes</a>.</p>
<p>The changes are major, backward incompatible, but necessary for the future
direction of the Cubes.</p>
<h2>Analytical Workspace</h2>
<p>The biggest change is the Workspace – pluggable data-warehouse.  You are no
longer limited to one one model, one type of data store (database) and one set
of cubes. The new Workspace is now framework-level controller object that
manages models (model sources), cubes and datastores. To the future more
features will be added to the workspace.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple models per workspace/server instead of only one</li>
<li>Multiple backends per workspace/server instead of only one</li>
<li>Multiple data stores per workspace/server instead of only one</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="static/images/cubes-1_0-workspace.png"/></p>
<p>Models can now be generated or converted on-the-fly from another service with
the new concept of <a href="http://cubes.databrewery.org/doc/extensions/providers.html">Model Providers</a>.</p>

<h2>Model Objects Redesign</h2>
<p>Notable change is addition of new object: <em>Measure Aggregate</em>. Cubes now
distinguishes between <em>measures</em> and <em>aggregates</em>. measure represents a
numerical fact property, aggregate represents aggregated value (applied
aggregate function on a property, or provided natively by the backend). This
new approach of aggregates makes development of backends and clients much
easier. There is no need to construct and guess aggregate measures or
splitting the names from the functions. Backends receive concrete objects with
sufficient information to perform the aggregation (either by a function or
fetch already computed value).</p>
<p>Now you can name the "record_count" as you like or you might not have it at
all, if you do not like it.</p>
<p>More info about model can be found in the
<a href="http://cubes.databrewery.org/doc/model.html">model documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Other model changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>cardinality</em> - metadata that helps front-end to determine which kind of UI
  item to use or might restrict hich-cardinality queries</li>
<li><em>dimension linking</em> – cubes can specify how the dimensions are going to be
  linked: specify what hierarchies are relevant to the cube, how what is the
  cardinality of dimension in the context of the cube and more.</li>
<li><em>roles</em> dimensions and levels can have roles – metadata that might make
  dims/levels be handled in a special way. Currently only the <code>time</code> role is
  implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h1>HTTP API Changes</h1>
<p>The server end-points have changed. Concept of global model was dropped, now
there is just list of cubes. The front-end should approach the server in two
steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get list of cubes with <code>/cubes</code> – only basic information, no structure
metadata</li>
<li>Get full cube model with <code>/cube/NAME/model</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many actions now accept <code>format=</code> parameter, which can be <code>json</code>, <code>csv</code>
or <code>json_lines</code> (new-line separated JSON).</li>
<li>Cuts for date dimension accepts named relative time references such as
  <code>cut=date:90daysago-today</code></li>
<li>Dimension path elements can contain special characters if they are escaped
  by a backslash such as <code>cut=city:Nové\ Mesto</code></li>
</ul>

<h1>Backends</h1>
<p>New backends:</p>
<ul>
<li>MongoDB (thanks to Robin Thomas)</li>
<li>full implementation of the Slicer backend</li>
<li>Mixpanel</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>With model providers you can easily create a backend for any other service
which serves cube-like data and plug it into your data warehouse.</p>
<h1>SQL Features</h1>
<p>Notable addition to the SQL backend are outer joins (finally!): three types of
joins were added to the SQL backend: match (inner), master (left outer) and
detail (right outer).</p>
<p><a href="http://pythonhosted.org/cubes/backends/sql.html">More info</a> about the SQL
features.</p>
<h2>Non-additive</h2>
<p>Provisional semi-additive time dimension support was added. An aggregate can
specify that it is non-additive through the time dimension (such as account
amount snapshots) and the generated query will handle the situation by
choosing the latest entry used.</p>
<p>The initial metadata infrastructure is in place. More flexible implementation
that will include other dimensions and element selection functions will be
introduced in the future releases.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Robin Thomas for this feature.</p>
<h1>Authentication and Authorization</h1>
<p>Authentication at the server level and authorization at the workspace level.
The interface is extensible, so you can implement any method you like. The
built-in methods are pretty simple:</p>
<p>permissive authentication methods: pass-parameter – just pass api_key
parameter in the URL or Basic HTTP proxy – using username, ignoring password
(there is one for testing purposes called "adminadmin" ...)</p>
<p>authorization: JSON configuration for roles (inheritable) and rights.</p>
<p>The authorization has two parts: access to the cube and restriction cell for a cube.</p>

<h1>Visualizer</h1>
<p>Cubes comes with a built-in Visualizer – a web app for visualizing cubes data
over time series. Main features: drill-down, filtering, many chart options,
connects to any cubes server. The application was developed by Robin Thomas
and Ryan Berlew.</p>

<h1>About the Release</h1>
<p>This release is a milestone in Cubes interface: the model metadata structure
and the slicer API. They are very unlikely to be changed, may be slighly
adjusted with maintaining backward compatibility or at least some kind of
conversion tools.</p>
<p>Things that might change, due to planned refactoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python interface – mostly Workspace and model compilation</li>
<li>Localization – definition of model localization</li>
<li>Extensions interface - which methods the extensions should implement and how</li>
<li>Configuration – slight changes in the slicer.ini sections</li>
</ul>
<p>The above changes will be stabilized around
<a href="https://github.com/DataBrewery/cubes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.1">v1.1</a>
or v1.2 release.</p>
<p>To sum it up: it is safe to build applications on top of the Slicer/HTTP
interface and it is safe to generate models to be used by cubes.</p>
