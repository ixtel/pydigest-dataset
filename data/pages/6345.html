<p>In college football scheduling, the Power 5 conference schools (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, or SEC) almost always host schools from the smaller conferences (Sun Belt, MAC, etc).  The big school (usually) get a win and the smaller school walks away with a paycheck of up to $1 million.</p>

<p>But some Power 5 schools play a small-conference school on the road a handful of times a year. So I wrote a Python script to find them all.</p>

<p>Requirements: </p>



<p>Note: both SQLAlchemy (for database creation) and Beautiful Soup (for web scraping) can be installed by <code>pip install sqlalchemy beautifulsoup4</code> or are available as pre-installed modules in <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.  </p>

<p>To run:</p>

<pre><code>python print_results.py
</code></pre>

<p>The script first creates a blank MySQL database. Next, that database is populated with all FBS schools and their conference.  We use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCAA_Division_I_FBS_football_programs">Wikipedia table</a> of FBS schools.</p>

<p>Finally, we compare our database with an online college football schedule to determine which Power 5 teams are playing road games vs. a non-Power 5 opponent each week.  I used the schedule on the <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/schedules/FBS/week1">CBS Sports website</a>.</p>

<p>Output for the 2015 season looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>School database created at /home/user/FBS_Power5/FBS_schools.db

Air Force is not a Power 5 school, they're in the Mountain West
Akron is not a Power 5 school, they're in the MAC
Alabama is a Power 5 school in the SEC
