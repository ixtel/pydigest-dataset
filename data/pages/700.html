<p>Version 0.2 of Motor, the asynchronous MongoDB driver for Python and Tornado, has been released.</p>
<p>This release is compatible with MongoDB 2.6 and PyMongo 2.7. It dramatically improves interoperability with Tornado coroutines, includes support for non-blocking DNS, and adds numerous smaller features.</p>

<p>That's it! With the Motor release behind me, I'm looking forward to enjoying PyCon, and <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/284/">talking about async at 3:15pm tomorrow</a>.</p></div>
