The latest PyDev release (3.9.0) is just out. 
</p>
<p>
The major feature added is that it now has vertical indent guides -- see screenshot below -- they're turned on by default and may be configured in the preferences: PyDev &gt; Editor &gt; Vertical Indent Guide.
</p><p>
This has actually been a long-awaited feature and was added as one of the targets in the last crowdfunding!

Besides this, the 3.9.0 release is packed with many bug-fixes:

</p><ul>
<li>A critical issue with the minimap when on Ubuntu 12 was fixed. </li>
<li>Some issues in the interactive console (which were introduced due to the latest enhancements related to asynchronous output) were also fixed</li>
<li>A bunch of others -- which may be seen at the release notes in <a href="http://pydev.org/">http://pydev.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, this release makes the horizontal scrollbar visible by default again... this is mostly because many users seemed to be confused by not having it (personally, as the editor still scrolls with the cursor and my lines usually aren't that long, it doesn't really bother me, but I can see that many users expect having it -- so, those that want it hidden have to disable it in the minimap preferences and not the other way around).
</p><p>
-- Note that the vertical scroll is still hidden as the minimap is enabled by default.
