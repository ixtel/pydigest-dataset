                        <p>Magnetic's real-time bidding system, written in pure Python, needs to keep up
with a tremendous volume of incoming requests. On an ordinary weekday, our
application handles about 300,000 requests per second at peak volumes, and
responds in under 10 milliseconds. It should be obvious that at this scale
optimizing the performance of the hottest sections of our code is of utmost
importance. This is the story of the evolution of one such hot section over
several performance-improving revisions.</p>


<h1>Real Time Bidding</h1>
<p>Real Time Bidding, or RTB, is a technique by which many internet ads delivered.
When you visit a website using RTB, a request is sent to dozens or hundreds of
"bidders" which have to quickly decide whether they want to show you an ad, and
if so, how much they would like to pay. RTB bidders have up to 100 milliseconds
to make this decision -- any slower and you won't win the auction no matter how
much you bid -- so performance is key.</p>
<p>At Magnetic, we do much of our targeting in real time during the bid request. We
use a combination of filters to qualify ad campaigns for the particulars of the
bid request. Here we'll consider just one of the several types of filters we
use, one which checks that the content category of the page where an ad will be
shown against a set of categories that we want to target.</p>
<p>Of course, different campaigns have different targeting criteria, and thus
different filter configurations. Additionally, each campaign may use a different
subset of filters. On average, we end up calling about 150 filters per bid
request, or 4.5 million filters per second total at peak times, so ensuring
maximal performance is essential.</p>
<h1>First Approach: Classes</h1>
<p>The obvious way to implement such a filter is to use a class to store the
configuration, thus allowing multiple instances of the filter for different
campaigns. At bidding time, we look up the set of instances which represent the
filters for each of the campaigns the user was targeted for, and call each
filter to determine if the user is eligible for the campaign. Such a class might
look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PageCategoryFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mode</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"mode"</span><span class="p">]</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">categories</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mode</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"whitelist"</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">categories</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">categories</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span>
                <span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">categories</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This code would pass most code reviews, and is a fairly straightforward
implementation of the idea we've thus far described only in prose. (We pass in a
dictionary of configuration, rather than direct arguments, since we have
different types of filters and want all of them to expose the same interface to
the code that sets them up and calls them.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though perhaps unexpectedly given the topic of this post, there
is a performance problem with this approach, especially for a block of code that
will be called millions of times per second.</p>
<h2>The Bound Method Problem</h2>
<p>Superficially, accessing the <code>categories</code> attribute and <code>filter</code> method appear
to be doing about the same amount of work -- both access the attribute of an
instance. Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a_filter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">PageCategoryFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"whitelist"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"bar"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"baz"</span><span class="p">]))</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a_filter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">categories</span>
<span class="go">frozenset(['baz', 'foo', 'bar'])</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a_filter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">filter</span>
<span class="go">&lt;bound method PageCategoryFilter.filter of &lt;PageCategoryFilter object at 0x107f13910&gt;&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As expected, <code>categories</code> returns the attribute's value, but accessing <code>filter</code>
returns a bound method object. What is a bound method? It's the magic that
allows Python to insert the <code>self</code> argument when you call the method.</p>
<p>Specifically, an instance's methods are access via a descriptor, a Python
feature that allows some code to be executed to satisfy the results of an
attribute access expression. When Python executes the definition of a class, it
wraps each function in a descriptor whose job is to supply the <code>self</code> argument.
Later, when you access the attribute for the method, Python calls <code>__get__</code> on
the descriptor, and supplies the instance as an argument. This allows the method
descriptor to rewrite the call to the underlying function to include the <code>self</code>
argument. For more, see <a href="http://chrisbeaumont.org/">Christ Beaumont</a>'s excellent
<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/ChrisBeaumont/5758381/raw/descriptor_writeup.ipynb">Python Descriptors
Demystified</a>,
or watch a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A1ycvcgc_U">video version</a> of
it.</p>
<p>From a performance perspective, the key difference between ordinary attribute
access and method calls is that each time you call a method, or rather each time
you access the attribute which refers to a method, the Python VM must execute
some additional code to create the bound method. It must do more work in order
to provide the <code>self</code> argument. None of this extra work is ordinarily visible --
it doesn't show up in stack traces, for instance -- but it does take some small
amount time to execute, and if you call methods often enough, that can add up.</p>
<h1>Second Approach: Functions</h1>
<p>If bound methods are a problem, perhaps we can arrange for all the pertinent
arguments just to be passed in to an ordinary function. This should avoid the
overhead of supplying the <code>self</code> attribute:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">page_category_filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"mode"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"whitelist"</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span>
            <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span>
            <span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span>
        <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As we'll see in benchmarks, this code slightly outperforms the class-based
implementation by avoiding the need for bound method calls. But is this as fast
as we can make the filter go?</p>
<h2>The Dictionary Access Problem</h2>
<p>In either branch of this function, we do three dictionary accesses: one for
"mode", one for the "categories" item in the bid request dictionary; and one
for the "categories" item in the configuration dictionary. Since none of these
accesses is repeated in any individual call of this function, it makes no sense
to assign the result of the dictionary accesses to a local variable and thus
"cache" the result.</p>
<p>"But wait," you say, "aren't dictionaries fast?"</p>
<p>Ordinarily, and algorithmically, yes, dictionaries are quite fast. However,
hidden behind those square brackets is quite a bit of work: Python must hash the
key, apply a bit-mask to the hash, and look for the item in an array that
represents the storage for the dictionary. Edge cases can create collisions
which take even longer to resolve. For a more thorough exploration of how
dictionaries are implemented in Python, see <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/">Brandon
Rhodes</a>' talk <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/talks/#mighty-dictionary">The Mighty
Dictionary</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, for frequently-called code the cost of dictionary item access,
however small, is amplified and adds up.</p>
<h1>Final Approach: Closures</h1>
<p>So if even dictionaries are too slow, how can we resolve this performance
crisis? We can turn the "variables" stored in the dictionary into local
variables (sort of), which are the fastest to access since they are stored in an
array and referenced by pre-computed offset. Accessing a local variable in
Python is nearly instantaneous, or as close to it as we can get writing Python
code.</p>
<p>A closure is a function which uses variables defined in its enclosing scope -- a
nested function. Python recognizes that the (inner) function uses variables that
aren't in its argument list, and makes those variables available to the inner
function. Such an inner function is said to "close over" the variables it uses
from the outer scope, hence "closure".</p>
<p>Because the number and names of closures is known at compile time, the VM can
use an array to track the closed-over variables, in the same way as it uses an
array to track local variables and constants. For more on how Python builds and
executes a function, see <a href="http://late.am/post/2012/03/26/exploring-python-code-objects.html">Exploring Python Code
Objects</a>.</p>
<p>We translate our page category filter into a closure by creating a factory
function which returns another function, the closure itself. From the
perspective of the calling code, this looks and feels a lot like creating an
instance of a class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_page_category_filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">categories</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">mode</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"mode"</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">page_category_filter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">mode</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">"whitelist"</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">bool</span><span class="p">(</span>
                <span class="n">categories</span> <span class="ow">and</span> <span class="ow">not</span>
                <span class="n">bid_request</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">categories</span>
            <span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">page_category_filter</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As we'll see, this implementation outperforms either of the others, because we
avoid two of the three dictionary lookups, and replaces them with fast access to
the closed-over variables <code>categories</code> and <code>mode</code>. Additionally, callers don't
suffer from the bound method problem, since <code>page_category_filter</code> is just a
regular function with no magically inserted arguments.</p>
<h1>The Proof is in the Timing</h1>
<p>Each of the three methods shown here is "fast" in the sense that filtering any
single bid request takes very little actual time -- less than a microsecond on
my machine in all cases. However, since this code (and other code like it) is
called inside of what amounts to very tight loops, even tiny differences in the
run time of a single invocation amount to a lot overall.</p>
<p>To fully exercise the code paths, we'll create four filter configurations: a
whitelist with some allowed categories, a blacklist with some forbidden
categories, an empty whitelist, and an empty blacklist. We'll call each of them
an equal number of times in a straightforward timing loop. Here's an example
using the first implementation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">filters</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="n">PageCategoryFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"whitelist"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"bar"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"baz"</span><span class="p">])),</span>
    <span class="n">PageCategoryFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"blacklist"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"foo"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"bar"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"baz"</span><span class="p">])),</span>
    <span class="n">PageCategoryFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"whitelist"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[])),</span>
    <span class="n">PageCategoryFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"blacklist"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[])),</span>
<span class="p">]</span>

<span class="n">bid_request</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">"categories"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"bat"</span><span class="p">)}</span>

<h2>What about PyPy?</h2>
<p>At Magnetic, we've switched from running all of our performance-sensitive Python
code from CPython to PyPy, so let's consider whether these code optimizations
are still appropriate. I used the same benchmark setup as above, but with PyPy
2.5.1 and a warmup run for each implementation to allow PyPy time to JIT:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<td>-28.3%</td>

<tr>

<td>0.1%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>PyPy is incredibly fast, around an order of magnitude faster than CPython in
this benchmark. Because PyPy performs more advanced optimizations than CPython,
including many optimizations for classes and methods, the timings for the class
vs. closure implementations are a statistical tie.</p>
<p>Curiously, the function implementation is actually slower than the class
approach in PyPy. PyPy is able to optimize code using classes more than code
using dictionaries, because it is able to specialize code for each class in your
program. Dictionaries, on the other hand, are a generic mapping data structure,
and PyPy is not able to create specialized machine code for one particular
"shape" of dictionary or another. <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/">Alex Gaynor</a> covers
this distinction in greater depth in his talk <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2627/fast-python-slow-python">Fast Python, Slow
Python</a> from PyCon 2014.</p>
<h1>So what have we learned?</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a> implores us to
implement our code in the "one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way", which
is likely one of the first two approaches presented here (depending on whether
you favor functions or classes). Indeed, this is still good advice, as code is
read far more often than it is written. However, there are cases where less
obvious ways have distinct benefits. Or maybe I'm just Dutch.</p>
<p>We also must always remember our
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Knuth</a>: "<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization">premature optimization is
the root of all evil</a>." At
Magnetic, we pursued this optimization only because it made sense for our
application, where the filters are called very frequently, and only after
measurement showed that the real-time filters accounted for a large amount of
our per-request processing time.</p>
