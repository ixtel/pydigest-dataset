<p>I was trying to run Jenkins on a simple Python test. It's my first time, so I followed steps mentioned in this tutorial : <a href="http://blog.clickthisnick.com/continuous-integration-ui-automation-test/" rel="nofollow">Link</a></p>

<p>My Jenkins console output after I triggered build shows that it failed because it couldn't find any revision.</p>

<p>Here is the console output :</p>

<pre><code>Started by user anonymous
Building in workspace    /usr/share/tomcat7/.jenkins/jobs/PythonUIProject/workspace
&gt; git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree # timeout=10
Fetching changes from the remote Git repository
&gt; git config remote.origin.url /home/rahul/PycharmProjects/.git/ # timeout=10

&gt; git --version # timeout=10
&gt; git -c core.askpass=true fetch --tags --progress /home/rahul/PycharmProjects/.git/ +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*


Seen 0 remote branches
ERROR: Couldn't find any revision to build. Verify the repository and branch configuration for this job.
Finished: FAILURE
</code></pre>

<p>My Git installation folder is : <code>home/rahul/PycharmProjects/</code>, and my system is a <code>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</code>.</p>

<p>I tried changing the <code>Branches to Build</code> under the <code>Source Code Management configuration</code> to be <code>**</code> in place of <code>*/master</code> as a workaround but it didn't work.</p>

<p>Has anybody worked on this before? What should be the solution to this.</p>

<p>Edit 1 : As per suggestions I tried using the <code>git push</code> to push the code, but I am getting this :</p>

<pre><code>  rahul@oneplusone:~/PycharmProjects$ git push -u /home/rahul/PycharmProjects/.git master
  error: src refspec master does not match any.
  error: failed to push some refs to '/home/rahul/PycharmProjects/.git'
