<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on November 24, 2015 </span>

<p>In accordance with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/">our security release policy</a>, the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.7.11, 1.8.7, and 1.9 release candidate 2. These releases are now available on PyPI and our download page. These releases address a security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch has also been updated.</p>

<h3>CVE-2015-8213: Fixed settings leak possibility in <tt class="docutils literal">date</tt> template filter</h3>
<p>If an application allows users to specify an unvalidated format for dates and
passes this format to the <tt class="docutils literal">date</tt> filter, e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal">{{ last_updated|date:user_date_format }}</tt>, then a malicious user could
obtain any secret in the application's settings by specifying a settings key
instead of a date format. e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">"SECRET_KEY"</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">"j/m/Y"</tt>.</p>
<p>To remedy this, the underlying function used by the <tt class="docutils literal">date</tt> template filter,
<tt class="docutils literal">django.utils.formats.get_format()</tt>, now only allows accessing the date/time
formatting settings.</p>
<p>Thanks Ryan Butterfield for reporting the issue.</p>
