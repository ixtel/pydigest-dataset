<p>I am using Pyramid with SQLAlchemy, and I have the following section in my <code>development.ini</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[logger_sqlalchemy]
# level = INFO
level = WARN
handlers =
qualname = sqlalchemy.engine
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever I want to enable SQL statement / echo, I edit that file and change the comment so it becomes <code>level = INFO</code>.</p>

<p>My question is how can I do this from the command line, without editing the file in a text editor. </p>

<p>Other web frameworks have built-in support for this, but I couldn't find a solution for Pyramid / SQLAlchemy.</p>

<p>I'd like to support <code>pserve</code>, <code>pshell</code>, and <code>alembic</code>.</p>
