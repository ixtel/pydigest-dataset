		<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>We here on the Python team at Microsoft are starting a blog. And since this is the first post, we wanted to give a bit of an introduction of who we are, what we do, and what this blog is for.</p>
<h1>Microsoft has a Python team?</h1>
<p>Yes, we do! We are part of the Data Group in Azure, the same group that brings you <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/">SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://studio.azureml.net">Azure ML Studio</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/cortana-analytics-suite/overview.aspx">Cortana Analytics Suite</a>. Python is obviously a big part of data science these days, and so it’s great for us to be located so close to the teams that are really advancing the field.</p>
<p>You may have already seen <a href="https://aka.ms/jupyter">Jupyter Notebooks in Azure ML Studio</a> and the <a href="https://gallery.cortanaanalytics.com/notebooks">Cortana Analytics Gallery</a> – that was us. We’ve also collaborated with other teams to bring the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azureml">Azure ML data access SDK</a> for Python, so you can programmatically bring your data sets in and out of Azure ML Studio.</p>
<p>Besides our data-focused work, we also work with the Visual Studio team to provide <a href="https://aka.ms/ptvs">Python support</a> through <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS">Python Tools for Visual Studio</a>, which you can get in any of the free (or paid) versions of <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs-2015-product-editions">Visual Studio 2015</a>.</p>
<p>We also help out other teams at Microsoft to improve their Python support, so you can use Python in <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/">Azure App Service</a>, for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/">Application Insights</a>, <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-us/iot">Windows IoT</a>, or to manage all of your Azure services with the cross-platform <a href="http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Azure SDK for Python</a>.</p>
<p>And we work with groups in the community, whether that’s <a href="http://ipython.org/microsoft-donation-2013.html">sponsoring the Jupyter/IPython project</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PyLadiesSEA/status/651064897447575553">hosting PyLadies events</a>, supporting <a href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2015/03/for-microsoft-python-support-extends.html">PyCon US</a> or hosting <a href="http://seattle.pydata.org/">PyData Seattle</a> in our conference center.</p>
<h1>Why do you need a blog?</h1>
<p>Because we have so much to tell you! Obviously we want to have our own home to announce product releases and updates, but there’s so much more.</p>
<p>As part of, ahem, “testing our products”, sometimes our engineers write cool side-projects. So if you want to play with speech recognition and natural language processing in Python, you can grab the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/projectoxford">Project Oxford</a> package we wrote for a demo. Work with Excel a lot? You may find <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Pyvot/tutorial.html">PyVot</a> interesting. Or if you have a Kinect, you can use our <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykinect2">PyKinect2</a> libraries with them. These are not official products and they are basically unsupported, but they’re out there for sharing (by the way – they’re all on GitHub if you’d like to help flesh them out).</p>
<p>We also get to speak at various conferences, mostly about Python, and sometimes we just make short <a href="https://aka.ms/ptvstutorial">training videos</a>. How else are you going to find these if you’re not following our blog?</p>
<p>Some members of our team are also <a href="http://www.python.org">CPython</a> core developers, and may have reputations for being <a href="http://www.snarky.ca/">snarky Canadians</a>. I’m sure they have interesting things to discuss, but we’ll tag them with a “snark” warning so you can choose whether to read them or not.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to capture Python engineering stories. We’ll be going around Microsoft to the teams that are using Python for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mustafakasap/archive/2016/02/04/py-01-visual-studio-publish-python-script-on-a-unix-machine-amp-remote-debug.aspx">awesome stuff</a>, but we’d also love to share customer stories (with permission, obviously). So if <i>you’ve</i> done something awesome with Python, Azure, Visual Studio, or Azure ML and want to brag about it, email us at <a href="mailto:python@microsoft.com">python@microsoft.com</a> and suggest it. We can’t promise to publish everything, but we’d love to hear about it regardless.</p>
<h1>How can I keep up to date?</h1>
<p>Over to the right of this page (or at the bottom if you’re on a small screen) is our RSS feed. You can also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/pt4vs">@pt4vs</a> on Twitter to get notifications whenever we post something new.</p>
<p>Most of our team also use Twitter for everything from Python to puppies, and you can find us on <a href="https://twitter.com/john_lam/lists/data-science-tools-team">this list</a>. Or comment on any post if you have follow-up questions or suggestions.</p>
<p>We already have a backlog of content to share here, so we hope to see you again soon.</p>
