Our Openshift's application current state using the latest revision <br/>
</p>
 
<p align="justify">
Although I never marked our live <a href="http://bio-ekowibowo.rhcloud.com">Bio Application</a> as published, actually at the current state it shouldn't be treated as a production quality application. The main reason is simple : up until now, our database will always be recreated when application started, discarding any data already entered by our users. We do this to allow us focusing our work on perfecting application features than to manage our own database migration script. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Today we are going to have a look on how exactly a database migration technique is implemented. It will allow our application to be stamped as Production Quality application, as it will allow users to registered safely into our application. Whatever development changes we introduce, our users data will not just get thrown to the void. The database schema will be upgraded and existing data will be merged to the new schema. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
In our beloved Python world there are plenty of database migration tools available. But as we use SQLAlchemy, well, don't you think that <a href="https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic‎">the author</a> of SQLAlchemy should be the  the legitimate author to  write its database migration tool? Well then, introducing <a href="http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">Alembic</a>! 
</p>
<p align="justify"/>
<h1>
What is Data Migration?
</h1>
<p align="justify">
The main concept of data migration is to let us track how our database changes are gradually introduced into versions, and also making us able to move back and forth to each of the database version (although at some point of time, surely you don't want to keep track all previous versions from the starting revision). For those who have worked on Ruby project will understand <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html‎">how cool this feature is</a>. The same cool feature is also available in our Python application. In which, we are going to use Alembic to manage our database migration feature. Let see how easy it is to add data migration feature into our application!

I am trying to read your mind here... hm..<br/>
Got it. You're correct. Use pip <img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/js/tinymce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-laughing.gif" border="0" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"/> (phew, that wasn't so hard to read..)

Remember that you must first activate your virtualenv environment, so that alembic will be installed into your local <code>env</code> directory instead of global site-package directory. And don't forget to add it into your <code>setup.py</code> file, so that alembic will also be available in your Openshift hosted application. This is how our new <code>setup.py</code> look like:

</p>
<p align="justify">
Having <code>alembic</code> package installed, you can start issuing <code>alembic</code> command (which is installed in <code>env/bin/alembic</code>), and start managing database migration in your site.
</p>
<h2>
Initializing Alembic
</h2>
<p align="justify">
Let first initialize alembic for our application as follows:
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
This command will create <code>migration</code> directory in our application root directory (in the same level as <code>setup.py</code> file). Of course you can always use another directory name beside <code>migration</code>, such as <code>alembic</code>. Try to issue <code>alembic current</code> command, to show what is our data migration step currently. What do you get? Right, a connection error message.
<img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/js/tinymce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-laughing.gif" border="0" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"/> Sorry...
</p>
<p align="justify">
To configure alembic so that it knows our database location, simply open the file <code>alembic.ini </code>in root directory, and modify the line below:
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p>
<table class="python code"><tbody><tr class="li1"><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sqlalchemy.<span>url</span> <span>=</span> driver://<span>user</span>:<span>pass</span><span>@</span>localhost/dbname</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Please do configure it to match your develoment environment. In my Ubuntu Box, I configure it as follows:
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p>
<table class="python code"><tbody><tr class="li1"><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>sqlalchemy.<span>url</span> <span>=</span> postgresql://swdev<span>@</span>localhost/bio</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>  
</p>
<p align="justify">
I omitted the password field, as my PostgreSQL already configure to always trust localhost connection. In case you forgot, please do have a read on how to do it <a href="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/230_pythonthusiast/archive/1314_building_python_flask_application_in_openshiftheroku_replacement_part_v__implementing_application_model_using_sqlalchemy__postgresql_92.html">here</a>. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you run  <code>alembic current</code> command again, you will find that alembic now giving you this information:
</p>
<p align="justify">

Now our Alembic installation is correct!
</p></div>
<p>
 
</p>
<p align="justify">
It display our current database revision as None, as we haven't issued any database migration/revision. How do Alembic know in what revision do our database currently? Simple. It create <code>alembic_version</code> table in our database, and store it revisions data there.
</p>
<p>
Now that everything is in order, let us work with our first database migration : adding <code>currently_live_in</code> field, so that our fans (ehemm!) will know where we live. Just make sure they don't stalking on us! <img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/js/tinymce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-laughing.gif" border="0" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"/>
</p>
<p>
But before that, let us see what types of data migration there available in alembic. 
</p>
<h1>
Working with Data Migration
</h1>
<p align="justify">
There are two types of data migration : automatic and manual. Before continuing, please reaffirm that when we work with Python application using SQLAlchemy, we don't care much of our database structure in the back-end (served by PostgreSQL). Instead, we concentrate on building and restructuring our application model (which currently, still lives in a single <code>main.py</code> file). We can simply dropping and recreate the whole tables when our application still in development phase. But, this approach is not accepted when our application going live! Hence, the need of data migration arise. Or more importantly, an automatic data migration.
</p>
<h2>Automatic data migration: adding currently_live_in field<br/>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
An automatic data migration tool will let us work intensely with our application models, forgetting completely our database live in the back-end. When we satisfied with our application models changes, we can issue command to inspect the model changes and automatically generate a script to upgrade our back-end database. Later on we can inspect the upgrade script and alter it as necessary (such as merging data to new column). Let see how easy it's done with alembic.
</p>
<p align="justify">
First, to allow automatic data migration you have to modify <code>migration/env.py</code> file and include our application model path into alembic. Actually, this is the not so trivial obstacle you will face in case you are still new to python programming. Find the line that still commented which said, <code># target_metadata = mymodel.Base.metadata</code>. You have to uncommented this into <code> target_metadata = main.db.Model.metadata</code>. But it will generate error as we stored our application model inside <code>wsgi/main.py</code> file, and we haven't included the path <code>/wsgi</code> into python path module. Here is how to overcome this situation:
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p>
<table class="python code"><tbody><tr class="li1"><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;</span>span <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"delete_me"</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span>/span<span>&gt;</span><span>import</span> <span>os</span><span>,</span> <span>sys</span>
<span>sys</span>.<span>path</span>.<span>append</span><span>(</span><span>os</span>.<span>getcwd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> + <span>"/wsgi"</span><span>)</span>
 
<span>import</span> main
target_metadata <span>=</span> main.<span>db</span>.<span>Model</span>.<span>metadata</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
As we already have the required alembic code changes to allow automatic data migration, now our next step is to  modify our current application model : adding <code>currently_live_in</code> field, as follows:
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p>
<table class="python code"><tbody><tr class="li1"><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>class</span> Users<span>(</span>db.<span>Model</span><span>,</span> <span>object</span><span>)</span>:
    ...
    <span>currently_live_in</span> <span>=</span> db.<span>Column</span><span>(</span>db.<span>String</span><span>(</span><span>300</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>&lt;</span>span <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"delete_me"</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span>/span<span>&gt;</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
And run alembic command to do automigration,
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p>
<table class="python code"><tbody><tr class="li1"><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>alembic revision --autogenerate -m <span>'Adding currently_live_in field'</span><span>&lt;</span>span <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>"delete_me"</span><span>&gt;&lt;</span>/span<span>&gt;</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Alembic will give you output something similar to this:

<p align="justify">
We can see that alembic give us more than just adding <code>currently_live_in</code> field, so let us open the generated migration script in  <code>migration/versions/514****</code> file and focusing on the method <code>upgrade()</code> and <code>downgrade()</code>.

<p align="justify">
We don't care much about the dropping and creation of index, so let streamlined it a bit into this:

<p>

<p align="justify">
Now let us run our first database upgrade using this alembic command:

<p> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
We are telling alembic to upgrade our database into the latest version (alembic able to do this by looking at the current revision in <code>alembic_revision</code> table, in which you'll encounter result similar to this:

</p>
<h2>Manual data migration: merging firstname and lastname into fullname</h2>
<p align="justify">
If you have try and already have a grasp on how automatic data migration work, you will find that actually it is very for you to generate your own migration script, right? It was just a simple database structure changes using the familiar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language">DDL</a> (Data Definition Language). And also, an automatic data migration has its own limitation (which you can read about it <a href="https://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#auto-generating-migrations">here</a>), in which you must manually create your data migration script.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Here, let use manual data migration technique when we want to introduce new field (<code>fullname</code>) by merging the other two fields (<code>fullname</code> and <code>lastname</code>). To prepare a new migration script, issue the following command:
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p>
<table class="python code"><tbody><tr class="li1"><td><pre>1

<p align="justify">
These code main responsibility is in making sure that although we are dropping <code>firstname</code> and <code>lastname</code>, the data contained in those field will always still be there in the field <code>fullname</code>. Beside that, in doing downgrade (which is dropping <code>fullname</code> and bringing back <code>firstname</code> and <code>lastname)</code> we also make sure that the <code>fullname </code>will simply be stored into <code>firstname</code> (sure you can split it into <code>firstname</code> and <code>lastname </code>too if you like!). This will make sure that our application database when doing upgrade or downgrade will always be reversible. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Remember, as this is a manual upgrade, we must manually add <code>fullname</code> field and removing <code>firstname</code> and <code>lastname</code> from <code>Users </code>class.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Have a try on these two data migration technique to be able to fully leveraging Python data migration feature introduce by Alembic!
</p>
<h1>
Doing Migration in Openshift </h1>
<p align="justify">
You have done your database migration in your local system. That's great. But, unfortunately our application lives in Openshift. How is it possible for us to upgrade the database there? For those veteran in system administrator  will know the answer : use ssh to connect to openshift remote Linux box and issued its upgrade command there, as detailed below: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>SSH login to your Openshift application<br/>
	<span>rhc ssh --app &lt;applicationname&gt;</span></li>
	<li>Got to our application repo<br/>
	<code>cd app-root/runtime/repo</code> </li>
	<li>We need to modify <code>alchemy.ini</code> file, and change its <code>sqlalchemy.url</code> value into the correct Openshift setting. Let first inspect what is our Openshift DB_URL , by doing this command,<br/>
	<code>env | grep DB_URL</code><br/>
	It will output the complete database URL for your application, but what you need is only its username and Host IP Address. You don't need password (trusted connection) and port (defaulted to 5432). Edit it using <a href="http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html‎">vim</a>,<br/>
	<code>vi alembic.ini<br/>
	</code>Now change <code>sqlalchemy.url</code> into the format <code>postgresql://&lt;username&gt;@&lt;hostaddress&gt;/&lt;databasename&gt;</code> <br/>
	Save this file and exit, <code>:wq</code>. </li>
	<li>Everything is set, just run the usual upgrade command, <code><br/>
	alembic upgrade head</code><br/>
	It will give you output similar as below,<br/>
	<img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/gallery/230/automigration6.png" alt="Upgrading openshift database"/></li>
	<li>DONE</li>
</ol>
<p>
Is it?
</p>
<p>
For those who aware you will notice something problematic : <code>alembic.ini</code> is still in controlled by git. So, if subsequent <code>git push</code> command is issued, your changes to Openshift repo will be overriden. In our local environment, we will have to add <code>alembic.ini</code> into <code>.gitignore</code>. This will let each system (local and Openshift) having its own specific <code>alembic.ini</code> configuration.  
</p>
<p align="justify">
One last note, in your production environment, it's also better if before doing any upgrade/downgrade command, first you have to <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/backup.html">backup your database</a>. It will be a great guard for you, in case any unexpected failure should occur. 
</p>
<h1>
Conclusion</h1>
<p>
So, are you having fun upgrading and downgrading your database? Great :)
</p>
