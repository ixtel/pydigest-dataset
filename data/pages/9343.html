                    <p>I've heard good things about filepicker.io, which is a service that makes file uploading a much better experience. Unfortunately, the Django package for filepicker.io doesn't work with South. When I try to create a migration using the filepicker.io field using code like the following...</p>

<p>...when I try to run the command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>It results in this unpleasant looking response:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

 ! South cannot introspect some fields; this is probably because they are custom
 ! fields. If they worked in 0.6 or below, this is because we have removed the
 ! models parser (it often broke things).

<p>The last line in the error report is important. I'll repeat it to illustrate it more clearly:</p>

<p>Experience working on other projects has taught me I can simply add two lines of code to <tt class="docutils literal">products/models.py</tt> and everything should just work:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># South migration rules for the FPFileField field</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">south.modelsinspector</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">add_introspection_rules</span>
<span class="n">add_introspection_rules</span><span class="p">([],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"django_filepicker\.models\.FPFileField"</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In case it's not clear, here's my new <tt class="docutils literal">products/models.py</tt> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># products/models.py</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.db</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">models</span>

<p>Now I can create South migrations and they'll just work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem is that for any model where I need to use filepicker's FPFileField I need to add those two lines of code. I don't like this approach, since it violates <strong>Don't Repeat Yourself</strong> (DRY).</p>
<p>At some point I'll demonstrate how to fix this violation of DRY with an easy fix. In fact, I plan submit that fix as a pull request to django-filepicker.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2013/12/24:</strong> django-filepicker has been patched to address this issue. This blog post therefore describes a historical version of the package.</p>
