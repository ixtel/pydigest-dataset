            <p><a href="http://urubu.jandecaluwe.com" title="Urubu">Urubu</a> supports wiki links: a simple syntax to link to other
pages in the project. For example, <code>[/about-me]</code> refers to the <a href="/about-me.html" title="About me">About me</a>
page.  Wiki links are a great Urubu feature for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiki links are a very valuable, proven feature of wikis. </li>
<li>Urubu is the only static website generator that supports wiki links <abbr title="As far as I know">AFAIK</abbr>.</li>
<li>No new syntax is required: the Markdown syntax for reference links is reused.
Urubu resolves them over page names.</li>
<li>When no link text is specified, Urubu inserts the title of the page in the
html. This is great for readibility and consistency.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Urubu 0.6, this feature has been improved. <strong>Now you can link to a
specific location in a page.</strong></p>
<p>Things started with a pull request from <a href="https://github.com/SoftwareMaven">SoftwareMaven</a> that makes it possible
to link to anchors within a page.  As Urubu creates anchors for all headers you
can use those as targets.  Syntax-wise you add the anchor as a fragment to the
page name.  For example, <code>[/about-me#consultancy-services]</code> links to the
section <a href="/about-me.html#consultancy-services" title="About me">Consultancy Services</a> on the <a href="/about-me.html" title="About me">About me</a> page. </p>
<p>I improved on the feature so that you can use the original section header as a
fragment. For the example above, this would be <code>[/about-me#Consultancy
Services]</code>. Urubu will "slugify"  the fragment text to refer to the anchor, and
use it unchanged as the link text. In this way, the text clicked will match the
text where you land: <a href="/about-me.html#consultancy-services" title="About me">Consultancy Services</a>. </p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
