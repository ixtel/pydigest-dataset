<p>Daemon that runs and reports health checks</p>








<p>Sauna is a small daemon designed to run health checks and send the results to a
monitoring server. It is able to report to Nagios and Shinken out of the box.</p>
<p>It is made to be resource efficient (it avoids forking at all costs), simple
to install and low maintenance.</p>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Sauna is available on PyPI, you can install it with pip:</p>
<blockquote>
pip install sauna</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Using Sauna you will manipulate two entities: plugins and consumers.</p>
<p>Plugins are optional modules that provide a set of checks. There is for
instance the Load plugin which provides checks about load average or the Redis
plugin which monitors the status of a Redis database. You only opt-in for the
plugins that make sense for your setup.</p>
<p>Consumers on the other hand provide a way to send the results of checks
generated by plugins to your monitoring server. There is the NSCA consumer that
sends data to a Nagios compatible server or the HTTP consumer to send the check
results to an API like livestatus.</p>
<p>Start by generating a sample configuration file <tt><span class="pre">sauna-sample.yml</span></tt>:</p>
<pre>sauna sample
</pre>
<p>Edit the sample configuration to fit your system, pick the plugins that you
want and choose a consumer. When you are done move the file as <tt>sauna.yml</tt>.</p>
<p>Start sauna:</p>
<pre>sauna
</pre>
<p>You can easily run it as a daemon using systemd or supervisor.</p>
</div>
<div id="contributing">
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Sauna is written in Python 3. Adding a check plugin or a consumer should be
straightforward. Clone the repository and install it in development mode in a
virtualenv:</p>
<pre>pip install -e .
</pre>
<p>The code base follows pep8, test the code for compliance with:</p>
<pre>pep8 sauna test
</pre>
<p>Run the test suite:</p>
