<h1>ConfigTree</h1>
<p>Configuration files behave like cancer tumor.  As soon as one is created with
a handful of parameters, it starts to grow.  And in a couple of month it becomes
huge hardly supportable monster with dozens of parameters, which affects
on different subsystems of the project like metastasis.</p>
<p>The goal of ConfigTree project is to restrain the monster, but without
overkill for small projects.  It can be used in Python programs as well as
in programs written in <a class="reference internal" href="advanced_usage.html#ctdump"><span>other languages</span></a>.</p>
<p>ConfigTree will be useful for you, if you want to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>keep default configuration options and environment-specific ones separated;</li>
<li>fine-tune files to load for each environment;</li>
<li>validate configuration;</li>
<li>have templates and automation in your configuration files.</li>
</ul>
<p>ConfigTree supports out of the box YAML and JSON source files with some
<a class="reference internal" href="advanced_usage.html#updater"><span>syntactic sugar</span></a>.  And the support of other formats can be
easily <a class="reference internal" href="advanced_usage.html#source"><span>added</span></a>.  <a class="reference internal" href="advanced_usage.html#ctdump"><span>Command-line utility</span></a> builds
configuration into JSON and shell script formats, and can be <a class="reference internal" href="advanced_usage.html#formatter"><span>extended</span></a>
in the same way.</p>
