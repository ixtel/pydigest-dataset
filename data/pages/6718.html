<p>This release brings a lot of changes to the previous <em>PyCharm Educational Edition</em> including a brand new name: <strong>PyCharm Edu</strong>. In refining PyCharm Edu 2 we have taken inspiration from the motto, “Simple is better than complex,” from <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a>, an informational standard for the Python language.</p>
<p>In this release, we simplified the existing UI and functionality, adding educational features to help novice programmers become professional more quickly than ever before! Educators and teachers also receive new improvements for creating interactive programming courses and managing their students’ progress more easily.</p>
