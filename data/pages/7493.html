<p>Using Python I am consistently getting an</p>

<pre><code>(1205, 'Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction')
</code></pre>

<p>error whenever I try to insert into a particular table. However, when I try to insert directly from the MySQL console, it works just fine. Looking into the </p>

<pre><code>SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST
</code></pre>

<p>on the database reveals no other active queries. As this is a dev database with no live applications attached I can't envision any problem. However, it is being served on a server which hosts our production databases, so I strongly prefer not to do resets if possible. Any advice on how to debug this?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>
If I view the query being run against the database using <em>SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST</em>, that eventually fails with the above message, and then insert it manually from the MySQL console, it works as expected.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
Here is an example of the query:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO deals (user_ID, store_ID, storeChain_ID, title, dealSaving, 
dealDisclaimer, restriction, dealImage, dealURL, submit_ID, userProvider_ID, 
createDate, createDateTime, expirationDate, expirationDateTime, ZIP, STATE, 
city, businessType, DealType_ID, IP, rating, popular, dealSearchData, tag, 
submitName, provider_dealID)

        'Three-Week Photography Workshop',

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
An example using the suggestion is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>self.DB['master']['cursor'].execute("SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED")
self.DB['master']['con'].commit()
self.DB['master']['cursor'].execute(dealsquery,data)
self.DB['master']['con'].commit()
