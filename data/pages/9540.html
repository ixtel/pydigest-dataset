        <p>Here at Adafruit, we sell all of these amazing components, but we couldn’t find a good way to interact with them over the internet. There are certainly a lot of great services out there for datalogging, or communicating with your microcontroller over the web, but these services are either too complicated to get started, or they aren’t particularly fun to use. So, we decided to experiment with our own system, and that is how Adafruit IO got started.</p>

        <p>The API is the core of the system, but with only an API, it’s not that fun to use. We’ve built a few basic client libraries to simplify working with the API. We also have a dashboard with a few widgets that allow easy 2-way interaction with your devices. We plan on adding many more features, such as mapping and location awareness for your devices, triggers based on custom parameters, email alerts and more. Here's a preview of some of the adafruit.io projects we are working on while in beta! - <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-neopixel-controller">Adafruit IO Basics: NeoPixel Controller</a>.</p>

        <p>We are really happy with the way Adafruit IO is coming along and are now in an open beta. Interested in helping us test Adafruit IO? Once you have signed into your Adafruit account, click the join the open beta button.</p>
