In a keynote on day four of <a href="https://ep2015.europython.eu/">EuroPython 2015</a> in
Bilbao, Spain, Carrie Anne
Philbin looked at using Python in computer education for children.  She
covered some of the background on a new curriculum that has been
established in England and on why Python fits well into that curriculum.
She also talked about using the Raspberry Pi as a platform for that
teaching and at some of the challenges in using Python in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
Philbin considers herself an educator foremost and was a teacher at the
time she started out working with the Raspberry Pi and Python.  She now
works for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which is a registered educational
charity.  All of the profits from selling Raspberry Pi hardware go to the
foundation, which was set up to advance the education of adults and
children in computers and computer science.
</p>

<h4>Her journey</h4>

</a>

<p>
Her journey started in the classroom where she was teaching an "information
and communications technology" (ICT) class. In 2010 or 2011, Google's Eric
Schmidt had made a speech in the UK (her home) where he said that UK
computer science education was really bad and that it was being taught the wrong
way.  That was picked up by the media and was turned into a statement that
all of the ICT teachers in the UK were terrible.
</p>

<p>
That was depressing to her, so 
she started thinking about ways to bring some of the new
thinking about computer education into her classroom.  She heard about the
Raspberry Pi and tried to get one on the first day it was out, which was
unsuccessful for her as it was for many.  She did eventually get one two months
later, plugged it in, and saw that it was simply a Linux computer, which
was not anything new or exciting to her.
</p>

<p>
But she still saw it as a tool for teaching about computers, so to try to find
ways to use it in her classroom, she decided to attend a 
nearby <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/">Raspberry Jam</a> that was
being held at the Mozilla Space in London.  It was attended by fifty men
and three women; all of the women were teachers.  There were lots of "geeky
projects" that were presented at the meeting, but she didn't see anything
that she could bring into her classroom.
</p>

<p>
She eventually had the opportunity to address the meeting, so she explained
that she was a teacher and that she wanted to bring the Pi into the
classroom.  The projects she saw might not inspire students, she said, and
in particular might not inspire girls.  That elicited a heckling response
from one attendee who suggested that maybe she would need to program the
device to go shopping or organize sleepovers in order to attract girls.
</p>

<p>
That was a "terrible experience" (also recounted <a href="http://misscphilbin.blogspot.com/2012/07/first-raspberry-jam.html">here</a>), but once she returned to her seat
"something really amazing happened".  Ten different people came up to her
and told her 
to ignore the heckler, that they had ideas for projects that would
inspire students both male and female, and that they wanted to help.  From
there, everything started to snowball. She "kind of just took over" 
the education track at the next PyCon UK and she now serves on the board of
the Python Software Foundation. 
</p>

<p>
In September 2014, a new computing curriculum for England was
announced. From the age of five, children will learn to program and from
eleven, they will learn at least two programming languages, at least one of
them text-based.  Unfortunately, the government only put an additional £3.5
million 
toward the effort, which works out to about £175 per school.  That is not
really a useful amount of money for training and the like.
</p>

<p>
England is something of a pioneer in requiring computer education.  Israel
has long had computers as part of its curriculum.  Estonia, Australia, and
New Zealand have recently added the subject.  Some Scandinavian countries
look like they may doing so in the near future.  That's it, she said.
</p>

<h4>Why teach computing?</h4>

<p>
Philbin asked, why teach computing?  There are a number of reasons to do
so.  To start with, children are creative and imaginative; they are also
not afraid of failure.  Educators actually train that out of them along the
way.  Children will also tinker with things, which is how we all learn.
</p>

<p>
Another reason is for social mobility.  Most people with jobs in computer
science have come from affluent backgrounds.  Programming is also
empowering.  It makes people feel good about themselves and what they can
accomplish.  
Bringing more diversity into the technical fields is also a reason for
teaching about computers.  Only 16% of IT workers in the UK (and 20% in the
US) are women.  Those who are creating technology are not representative of
those who are using it.
</p>

<p>
The final and most important reason is shown in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">video</a> called "Humans
Need Not Apply".  Many things will become automated over time, including
tasks for people like supermarket clerks or baristas.  In addition,
technology such as
self-driving vehicles has the potential to put a lot of people out of a
job, including taxi and lorry (truck) drivers, when it becomes legal.  So
the goal is to train today's children to be able to program or fix these
machines. 
</p>

<p>
But the focus is shifting from "why?" to "how?".  The visual programming
language <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> is an easy win for
young children, but eleven-year-olds need to learn a text-based language.
So people started having a look at Python, she said.
</p>

<h4>Why Python?</h4>

<p>
There are good reasons to look at Python for education.  It is used all
over the world and is powerful enough to be used for real development.  It
is actually used in the real world by organizations like NASA, for example.
It has a simple syntax; 
by comparison, writing "hello world" in Java takes six lines of code.
</p>

<p>
Probably the most important reason for educators, though, is the
community.  Python has a strong and helpful community.  Raspberry Pi has a
great community, too, she said, but Python's tops it.  It is not just
national and international communities that are the big draw; it is the
local communities that really make Python special.
</p>

<p>
Python conferences have also taken up the cause of using the language in
education.  PyCon UK has had an educational track for the last eight
years.  This year, there were 40 teachers at PyCon UK.  If you build
it, they will start to come along, she said.
</p>

<p>
PyCon 2015 in Montréal had an educational track.  There is an educational
summit at this year's EuroPython; she was headed to PyCon Australia soon,
which will also have an educational track.  She suggested that conferences
should try to help teachers by starting these tracks.  They may not come
the first year, which would be sad, but they will see and start coming.
</p>

<h4>Barriers</h4>

<p>
There are some significant barriers to students trying to learn Python,
however.  To start with, it is a struggle to move from Scratch to Python.
The Raspberry Pi Foundation is trying to overcome some of that difficulty
with a game called <a href="https://github.com/pyland/pyland">Pyland</a>.
Python 2 versus Python 3 is also a problem, but it really shouldn't be.  There
is no reason not to just teach Python 3.  All of the foundation's
resources are written in Python 3 and most major libraries are
available for that version.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of naming issues that make Python difficult for
children, she said.  People write libraries for themselves and are not
always consistent with the names they choose.  She mentioned the
general-purpose I/O (GPIO) library for Raspberry Pi as an example.  It was
written by a UK brewer to regulate the temperature in his brewery.  That
library is now used in education all over the world.  Like other Python
libraries, it has inconsistencies that make it hard for students.
</p>

<p>
Another problem stems from children saving their program with the same name
as the library they are using.  It may seem obvious to everyone in the room
that naming your program that uses the pycamera library
<tt>pycamera.py</tt> will not 
lead to happiness, but she has done it herself.  When she did, there were
five Python developers trying to help her figure out the problem and it
actually took some time to do so.
</p>

<p>
Another example is the module for Minecraft.  It is a real hook for
children; it "kind of blows their mind" that you can build things in
Minecraft by writing a program.  But even the first line of a program
causes problems:
</p><pre>
    from mcpi.minecraft import Minecraft
</pre><p>
The capital letter often trips them up and children are impatient.  In
addition, the </p><tt>setPos()</tt><p> function's name is not all that helpful.
In Ruby, for example, the function is called </p><tt>mc_teleport</tt><p>, which is
much more obvious.


</p><p>
Another snippet of Minecraft code shows additional problems:
</p><pre>
    glass = block.GLASS.id
    mc.setBlock(40, 50, 60, glass)
</pre><p>
That is long-winded, and has the capital letters to deal with.  By
contrast, in Ruby it is simpler:
</p><pre>
    mc_set_block :glass, 40, 50, 60
</pre><p>
"Please think about children when naming things", Philbin said.


</p><p>
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">Pygame</a> is a great library for
children, but it is difficult to use in the classroom.  There are a lot of
concepts that need to be explained before you can start doing anything with
it.  That makes it hard to teach in an hour-long class.
Daniel Pope came up with <a href="http://mauveweb.co.uk/posts/2015/05/pygame-zero.html">Pygame Zero</a>
to help bridge that gap.  It simplifies Pygame by providing a runtime so
that students don't need to understand game loops, event queues, and other
concepts right away.  That means a simple program that actually does
something can be taught in a bite-sized lesson. It does make some decisions
for you, she said, but 
you shouldn't be afraid to do that for children.
</p>

<p>
Adding extra libraries is another hurdle.  It is easy to do it on one
computer, but not for 30 or 50—or for Raspberry Pi devices.  For one thing,
school computers tend to be behind firewalls or filtering software that can
make it difficult to simply access the extra libraries.  She and Pope have
been discussing an "education bundle" that would gather up useful libraries
(e.g. Pygame Zero, NumPy) into a single package to help with that problem.
</p>

<h4>IDEs</h4>

<p>
Finally, there is the problem of a Python integrated development
environment (IDE) for children.  Finding
programming interfaces for children is difficult.  She asked how many in
the audience used the Python-included IDLE as their IDE and got two or
three hands out of more than 500.  Being bundled with Python is a big
advantage for IDLE, since it will always be available, whether there is
internet connectivity or not.

</p><p>
She noted that her school was not able to
upgrade to the newest version of Scratch because you needed to sign up
online to get it.  At her school, the internet was slow and firewalled.
There are lots of online resources and IDEs for Python, but those won't
work for children and schools that don't have access (or have restricted
access) to the internet.
</p>

<p>
One offline option is the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/">PyCharm Educational
Edition</a>, which is free and open, but it is not obvious how to use it.  It
is great for children sixteen or older, but won't work for those who are
younger.  There are too many buttons and too much setup required.  There
needs to be an simpler open solution.
</p>

<p>
IDLE is one option.  It does come with simple syntax highlighting and
some auto-indentation.  But it runs in two separate windows, which is
confusing.  Adding a Minecraft window just makes that worse.  In addition,
the error 
reporting in IDLE is "atrocious", she said.
</p>

<p>
She showed a picture of the interface for an educational program developed
by Dr. Sam Aaron called <a href="http://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a>.
It is a synthesizer that can be live-coded to create various kinds of
sounds and music.
She apologized because it is written in Ruby, but it is a good example of a
nice interface for students.

</p><p>
In Sonic Pi 
there is a button for "Run" and one for
"Stop". There is a way to make the text smaller and larger (which is
needed in IDLE).  It has line numbers and its windows are all together as
panes in a larger window.  There is an inbuilt tutorial and it has a button
to align the Ruby code.  She wondered why there can't be something like
that for Python.
</p>

<h4>Helping out</h4>

<p>
There are plenty of ways for those interested to help, Philbin said. Meeting
with educators, talking with them, and listening to their problems is one
way.  Adding education tracks to conferences is another.  Having a special
education session at a local user group would be helpful, as would
mentoring a teacher so they have someone to turn to with questions.
In addition, creating and contributing "awesome libraries" (which have a
consistent API) would be quite helpful.
</p>

<p>
There is a new Python education workgroup that is getting started.  The
intent is to "make some things happen", like making IDLE better, for
example.  The group needs any help people can bring to its <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pythonedu-wg">mailing
list</a>.  She would like to see the group set some specific goals before
she tries to get recognition from the PSF board.
</p>

<p>
Ever the teacher, Philbin gave out some homework at the end of her talk.
First was to join the workgroup mailing list.  Second was to read and
contribute to Al Sweigart's <a href="https://github.com/asweigart/idle-reimagined">IDLE Reimagined</a>
project.  Last was to read Nicholas Tollervey's <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/python-in-education.csp"><i>Python
in Education</i></a> book, which is available as a free ebook.  All of the
homework is due by EuroPython 2016 (which will also be held in
Bilbao). "I will be checking", she said with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
There is a danger that writing code will become an educational fad and that
visual programming (with languages like Scratch) will dominate.  "Please
help make sure that doesn't happen".  She firmly believes that code should
be part of the curriculum and that it should be done with Python.  If that
doesn't happen, JavaScript could take over instead.
</p>

<p>
Computer education could change society in a positive way, she said.  When
the Raspberry Pi generation grows up in 20 years, they will not all be
developers, certainly.  But they could all benefit from the problem-solving
skills that learning programming will provide.
