<html><body><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Finally! After 4 years of half extremely boring lab-work and excruciating math exams I get a Computer Science diploma. Fantastic!</p><p>Was it worth it? Well, for one thing, I get a diploma - we'll see if that really helps me at anything at all. But did it learn me anything? Little.</p><p>Set aside the maths this faculty didn't learn me shit. You don't learn advanced stuff - from functional to UNIX programming everything is introductory stuff - you can finish the faculty with your head empty and your time wasted, easy. Just for a damn diploma.</p><p>You'll even have to write a project for the diploma thesis, you'll have to present it and at the end you'll find yourself very unsatisfied because your <em>audience</em> will be clueless (they didn't even know what a coroutine is, damn it!) and uninterested (they won't even bother to read your paper that took time and effort).</p><p>I doubt working though the pile of arrogant, bored teachers - some not even deserving their degree - that don't give a shit about you was worth giving 4 years of my life. I'm not saying not to do it - I'm saying to have <em>very low</em> expectations.</p></div></div></body></html>
