<p>I looked over the stack overflow question OnGle mentioned in his answer, and saw two solutions that I feel like I'd be able to implement.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Solution 1</h2>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/199288/4468084">http://stackoverflow.com/a/199288/4468084</a>
I could keep the PyGTK portion of the program in a <em>separate process</em> altogether, and just send data between the two currently running programs. However, this seems a bit overboard for what I need.</p>

<h2>Solution 2</h2>

<p>I could use either <a href="http://www.pygame.org/project/108/" rel="nofollow">PGU</a> or <a href="http://www.pygame.org/project/125/" rel="nofollow">OcempGUI</a>, which are both Pygame libraries meant to simplify low-level graphic programming stuff. Using one of these, I could forget about using PyGTK entirely and just use the premade objects from them.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>While solution 1 keeps my original PyGTK implementation in mind, it also might be overcomplicated for such a simple program that I'm making. On top of that, using solution 1 would also mean I'd have to continue having two windows open at once when my program is ran, making it seem cluttered and bulky.</p>

<p>Solution 2, on the other hand, cleanly integrates the object list into my Pygame project, while also lessening the amount of code I have to make. I also don't have to worry about different operating systems handling data transfers differently as would probably be a problem with solution 1. In the end, this seems like the better decision my situation.</p>
