<pre>Hi all,

thanks to the hard work of Marko Bencun and Yichao Yu, the next version
of PyOpenCL will be substantially different internally from the previous
one. In particular, the wrapper will no longer be built using
Boost.Python but instead using cffi 1.0's ahead-of-time mode. One main
consequence of this is that PyOpenCL now works on Pypy.

This new code is now on the git master branch. (It used to live on the
'cffi' branch. The old Boost wrapper is now on the
'deprecated-boost-python' branch.)

From a user's perspective, nothing should have changed--on all machines
I have access to, PyOpenCL passes the same tests as before, on any
Python version more recent than 2.6, including Pypy. Nonetheless, before
I go ahead and release a new PyOpenCL based on this code, I'd like to
get as many of you as I can to try it and report back. If you package
PyOpenCL, or if you have a Mac or a Windows machine, I'd especially like
to hear from you.

Thanks!
Andreas
