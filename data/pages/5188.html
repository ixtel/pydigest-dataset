A lot has been written about patterns since the turn of the century, for languages like Java, C++, C# and PHP.

Dynamic typing, functions as first-class objects, and some other additions to the object model all mean design patterns just work differently in this language. <br/><br/>++++Resources++++<br/>Write-up and code examples: <br/><a href="https://newcircle.com/observer-tut" class="yt-uix-sessionlink  " data-sessionlink="ei=UanVVuyvOdWjYNiemKAJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://newcircle.com/observer-tut</a><br/><br/>Advanced Python Newsletter: <br/><a href="http://migrateup.com/" class="yt-uix-sessionlink  " data-sessionlink="ei=UanVVuyvOdWjYNiemKAJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://migrateup.com/</a><br/><br/>Python Training from NewCircle: <br/><a href="https://newcircle.com/category/python" class="yt-uix-sessionlink  " data-sessionlink="ei=UanVVuyvOdWjYNiemKAJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://newcircle.com/category/python</a></p></div>  </div></body></html>
