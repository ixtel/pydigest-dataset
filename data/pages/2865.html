					<h1 class="entry-title">Introducing ViperPy – A Python library for interacting with the EMC ViPR API</h1>

					

					<div class="entry-content">
						<p><a href="https://github.com/chadlung/viperpy">ViperPy</a> is a <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> library for interacting with the <a href="https://community.emc.com/community/products/vipr">EMC ViPR API</a>. ViperPy began originally as an easy way to hook up numerous projects that needed to interact with the ViPR product in order to perform certain metering and billing extraction and handle authentication tokens behind the scenes. Very quickly I realized that it could be useful to others in my group if I added support for additional APIs and certain other features. ViperPy gives a great alternative to the <a href="https://community.emc.com/community/products/vipr">existing Java SDK</a> for ViPR if you would prefer to write your application in Python.</p>

<p><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> I currently work for EMC in their Rubicon Cloud services group. I in no way speak on behalf of the company or their products.</p>
<p>ViperPy is now being used by our group for production applications and is planned to be used as the basis for our upcoming testing suite against new ViPR releases. Installing <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/viperpy">ViperPy via PIP</a> is very easy:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">
$ pip install viperpy
</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> ViperPy currently requires Python 2.7.x. Python 3 support is planned.</p>
<p>You’ll find ViperPy very easy to use and examples can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/chadlung/viperpy/blob/master/README.rst">readme on Github</a>.</p>
<p>There is still plenty of work to be done like adding additional unit tests, additional API support, etc. however the main control plane API calls are already supported. Since we are actively using this library keep on eye on <a href="https://github.com/chadlung/viperpy">the repo</a> for any changes and enhancements.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is ViperPy is meant to work with the ViPR control plane, not the data plane. For that you can use Python libraries like <a href="https://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Boto</a> since ViPR supports many of the <a href="https://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/s3_tut.html">Amazon AWS S3 APIs</a>.</p>
