<p>For our February meetup, Andy Terrel will give a presentation entitled "<span>Building a startup with the PyData Ecosystem", focusing on his work as CTO of Fashion Metric.  </span><span>Fashion Metric helps online apparel retail sites fit their customers better and they do it with Python.  In this talk, Andy will outline the steps to building out a technology stack with the PyData ecosystem -- things they tried, both successful and otherwise. Audience participation will be encouraged!</span></p>
<p>Afterwards, we will have time for additional lightning talks, so please get in touch or leave a comment on the Meetup.com page if you'd like to give a short 5-10 minute talk.</p>
<p>Please note that our meetup this month will be back at the Capital Factory, and NOT at the Atlassian office!</p>
