<p>A toolkit for adaptive importance sampling featuring implementations of variational Bayes and population Monte Carlo.</p>

</p>






<p><tt>pypmc</tt> is a python package focusing on adaptive importance
sampling.  It can be used for integration and sampling from a
user-defined target density. A typical application is Bayesian
inference, where one wants to sample from the posterior to marginalize
over parameters and to compute the evidence. The key idea is to create
a good proposal density by adapting a mixture of Gaussian or student’s
t components to the target density. The package is able to efficiently
integrate multimodal functions in up to about 30-40 dimensions at the
level of 1% accuracy or less. For many problems, this is achieved
without requiring any manual input from the user about details of the
function. Importance sampling supports parallelization on multiple
machines via <tt>mpi4py</tt>.</p>
<p>Useful tools that can be used stand-alone include:</p>
<ul>
<li>importance sampling (sampling &amp; integration)</li>
<li>adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (sampling)</li>
<li>variational Bayes (clustering)</li>
<li>population Monte Carlo (clustering)</li>
</ul>
