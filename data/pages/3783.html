<html><body><div><div class="blog-entry" id="e20150314T133837"><p>One of the things that is very useful about Python is its extreme
    introspectability and malleability.  Taken too far, it can make your code
    an unmaintainable mess, but it can be very handy when trying to debug
    large and complex projects.</p><p><a class="offsite" rel="external" href="http://openedx.org">Open edX</a> is one such project.  Its main
    repository has about 200,000 lines of Python spread across 1500 files.
    The test suite has 8000 tests.</p><p>I noticed that running the test suite left a number of temporary directories
    behind in /tmp.  They all had names like tmp_dwqP1Y, made by the tempfile
    module in the standard library.  Our tests have many calls to mkdtemp,
    which requires the caller to delete the directory when done. Clearly, some
    of these cleanups were not happening.</p><p>To find the misbehaved code, I could grep through the code for calls to
    mkdtemp, and then reason through which of those calls eventually deleted
    the file, and which did not.  That sounded tedious, so instead I took the
    fun route: an aggressive monkeypatch to find the litterbugs for me.</p><p>My first thought was to monkeypatch mkdtemp itself.  But most uses of the
    function in our code look like this:</p><blockquote class="code"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">tempfile</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">mkdtemp</span><br/><span class="o">...</span><br/><span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mkdtemp</span><span class="p">()</span><br/></code></blockquote><p>Because the function was imported directly, if my monkeypatching code ran
    after this import, the call wouldn't be patched.  (BTW, this is one more 
    small reason to prefer importing modules, and using module.function in the
    code.)</p><p>Looking at the implementation of mkdtemp, it makes use of a helper function
    in the tempfile module, _get_candidate_names.  This helper is a generator
    that produces those typical random tempfile names.  If I monkeypatched that
    internal function, then all callers would use my code regardless of how
    they had imported the public function. Monkeypatching the internal helper
    had the extra advantage that using any of the public functions in tempfile
    would call that helper, and get my changes.</p><p>To find the problem code, I would put information about the caller into the
    name of the temporary file.  Then each temp file left behind would be a
    pointer of sorts to the code that created it.  So I wrote my own
    _get_candidate_names like this:</p><blockquote class="code"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">inspect</span><br/><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os.path</span><br/><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tempfile</span><br/><br/><span class="n">real_get_candidate_names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tempfile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_get_candidate_names</span><br/><br/><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_candidate_names_hacked</span><span class="p">():</span><br/>    <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"-"</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><br/>        <span class="s">"{}{}"</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><br/>            <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">basename</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">".py"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="p">),</span><br/>            <span class="n">t</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">],</span><br/>        <span class="p">)</span><br/>        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">t</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">inspect</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stack</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><br/>    <span class="p">)</span><br/>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">real_get_candidate_names</span><span class="p">():</span><br/>        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="s">"_"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">stack</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">"_"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">name</span><br/><br/><span class="n">tempfile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_get_candidate_names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_candidate_names_hacked</span><br/></code></blockquote><p>This code uses inspect.stack to get the call stack.  We slice it oddly, to
    get the closest three calling frames in the right order.  Then we extract
    the filenames from the frames, strip off the ".py", and concatenate them
    together along with the line number.  This gives us a string that indicates
    the caller.</p><p>The real _get_candidate_names function is used to get a generator of good
    random names, and we add our stack inspection onto the name, and yield
    it.</p><p>Then we can monkeypatch our function into tempfile.  Now as long as this
    module gets imported before any temporary files are created, the files
    will have names like this:</p><blockquote class="code"><code>tmp_case53-case78-test_import_export289_DVPmzy/<br/>tmp_test_video36-test_video143-tempfile455_2upTdS.srt<br/></code></blockquote><p>The first shows that the file was created in test_import_export.py at line 289, called
    from case.py line 78, from case.py line 53.  The second shows that
    test_video.py has a few functions calling eventually into tempfile.py.</p><p>I would be very reluctant to monkeypatch private functions inside other
    modules for production code.  But as a quick debugging trick, it works
    great.</p></div></div></body></html>
