If not, please visit this <a href="http://analyticsbot.ml/2014/12/learning-python-start/">page </a>to begin with. In this post, we will see the different types of buttons that one can use with Tkinter. There are three types of buttons: Simple Button, CheckButton, and RadioButton. We will go through them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Button</strong></p>
<p>The Button widget is a standard Tkinter widget used to implement various kinds of buttons. Buttons can contain text or images, and you can associate a Python function or method with each button. When the button is pressed, Tkinter automatically calls that function or method. The button can only display text in a single font, but the text may span more than one line. In addition, one of the characters can be underlined, for example to mark a keyboard shortcut. By default, the Tab key can be used to move to a button widget. Buttons are typically used to receive an action or an input from the user. Plain buttons are pretty straightforward to use. All you have to do is to specify the button contents (text, bitmap, or image) and what function or method to call when the button is pressed. Let’s see an example:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; auto-links: false;">
from Tkinter import *

master = Tk()

def callback():
    print "Button clicked!"

b = Button(master, text="OK", command=callback)
b.pack()

mainloop()
</pre>
<p>The above piece of code produces a simple Tkinter window with a OK button, which when clicked prints “Button clicked!” on the screen. To make an ordinary button look like it’s held down, for example if you wish to implement a toolbox of some kind, you can simply change the relief from RAISED to SUNKEN:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; auto-links: false;">
b.config(relief=SUNKEN)
</pre>
<p><strong>CheckButton</strong></p>
<p>The Checkbutton widget is a standard Tkinter widgets used to implement on-off selections. Checkbuttons can contain text or images, and you can associate a Python function or method with each button. When the button is pressed, Tkinter calls that function or method. The button can only display text in a single font, but the text may span more than one line. In addition, one of the characters can be underlined, for example to mark a keyboard shortcut. By default, the Tab key can be used to move to a button widget. Each Checkbutton widget should be associated with a variable. The checkbutton widget is used to choose between two distinct values (usually switching something on or off). Groups of checkbuttons can be used to implement “many-of-many” selections.</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; auto-links: false;">
from Tkinter import *

master = Tk()

varc = IntVar()
vard = IntVar()
varS = StringVar()
c = Checkbutton(master, text="Yes", variable=varc)
c.pack()

d = Checkbutton(master, text="No", variable=vard)
d.pack()

s = Checkbutton(
        master, text="Color image", variable=varS,
        onvalue="RGB", offvalue="L"
        )
s.pack()
mainloop()
</pre>

<p><strong>RadioButton</strong></p>
<p>The Radiobutton is a standard Tkinter widget used to implement one-of-many selections. Radiobuttons can contain text or images, and you can associate a Python function or method with each button. When the button is pressed, Tkinter automatically calls that function or method. The button can only display text in a single font, but the text may span more than one line. In addition, one of the characters can be underlined, for example to mark a keyboard shortcut. By default, the Tab key can be used to move to a button widget. Each group of Radiobutton widgets should be associated with single variable. Each button then represents a single value for that variable.  The radiobutton widget is used to implement one-of-many selections. It’s almost always used in groups, where all group members use the same variable.</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; auto-links: false;">
&lt;pre&gt;from Tkinter import *

master = Tk()

label = Label(master, text = "What is this example of?")
label.pack()

MODES = [
        ("RadioButton", "1"),
        ("CheckButton", "2"),
        ("Simple Button", "3"),
        ("Canvas", "4"),
    ]

v = StringVar()
v.set("2") # initialize

for text, mode in MODES:
    b = Radiobutton(master, text=text,
                        variable=v, value=mode)
    b.pack(anchor=W)

mainloop()
</pre>
<p><a href="http://analyticsbot.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/radiobutton1.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-230 aligncenter" src="http://analyticsbot.ml/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/radiobutton1.png" alt="radiobutton1"/></a></p>
<p>To turn the above example into a “button box” rather than a set of radio buttons, set the indicatoron option to 0. In this case, there’s no separate radio button indicator, and the selected button is drawn as SUNKEN instead of RAISED.</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; auto-links: false;">
b = Radiobutton(master, text=text, variable=v, value=mode)
</pre>

<p>Happy Python-ing!</p>
