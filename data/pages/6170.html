<p>A wrapper library for WinIO</p>








<p>A wrapper library for winio .</p>
<p>Thanks for the great WinIO library which comes from Yariv Kaplan.</p>
<p>The WinIO library binary distribution will download from <a href="http://www.internals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.internals.com/</a> during setup.</p>
<div id="privilege-requirements">
<h2>Privilege Requirements</h2>
<p>WinIo requires administrative privileges to run properly. This can be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using WinIo from a service running as LocalSystem (SE_LOAD_DRIVER_NAME privilege must be explicitly enabled).</li>
<li>Embedding a manifest file in the application that requests privilege elevation.</li>
<li>Requiring the user to choose the “Run as Administrator” option when launching the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The included C# samples demonstrate using an embedded manifest file to request privilege elevation.</p>

<div id="driver-signing-requirements-on-64-bit-systems">
<h2>Driver Signing Requirements on 64-bit Systems</h2>
<p>64-bit versions of Windows only load device drivers that are signed by a code signing certificate issued by a public CA such as Verisign, Thawte, etc. WinIo64.sys must not be deployed on production machines unless a code signing certificate is obtained and used to sign this file. The bundled copy of WinIo64.sys is signed with a self-signed certificate and can only be used on development/test machines with Windows running in a special “test” mode. In order to use the bundled version of WinIo64.sys, you need to take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open an elevated command window by right-clicking the icon and clicking “Run as Administrator”.</li>
<li>Type the following command to enable test-signing:</li>
</ul>
<p>bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON</p>
