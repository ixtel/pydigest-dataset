<h2>Why Jekyll?</h2>
<p>I've had issues with Blogger for some time.  After my fiancee, Audrey Roy, moved her blog to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll</a>, I was impressed enough to give it a try.</p>
<p>Why did it impress me?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-highlighting-made-easy">
<h2>Code highlighting made easy</h2>
<p>I don't have to hand-craft HTML code to get google prettify in a post. I just stick in a simple macro of 'highlight python' called like a Django templatetag and I get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'Daniel Greenfeld'</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">letter</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">letter</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This issue alone sums up why I don't do more blog posts with code.</p>

<div class="section" id="i-don-t-want-to-maintain-my-own-blog-site">
<h2>I don't want to maintain my own blog site</h2>
<p>A couple times I rolled out a blog on a site I stood up, but didn't really feel like maintaining a site. I want someone else to do it. When I write, I want someone else to worry about the details. I want to focus on writing and nothing else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-want-to-be-able-to-write-without-connection">
<h2>I want to be able to write without connection</h2>
<p>I need an internet connection to get my blogger posts to format right. With Jekyll, I can just type away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ability-to-publish-via-git">
<h2>Ability to publish via git</h2>
<p>My <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org">http://pydanny-event-notes.rtfd.org</a> has really exploded in my own usage and continued because it uses the same patterns I use in software development. I'm used to the pattern of using Git to push up content, so why use naked HTML? Sure, there are RST-to-HTML processors that I could use to generate that HTML, but they always require an some amount of manual correction. Jekyll, and it's alternatives,let me just write.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-not-jekyll">
<h2>Why not Jekyll?</h2>
<p>Jekyll is written in <a class="reference external" href="http://ruby-lang.org">ruby</a>. Nothing against ruby, but I can't trivially work in that language the way I can in Python. It's good to eat your own dogfood.</p>
<p>So I started looking at <a class="reference external" href="http://hyde.github.com/">hyde</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://blogofile.com/">blogofile</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.readthedocs.org/">pelican</a> as alternatives. More on that later.</p>
