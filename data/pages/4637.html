<h2>Security release issued: 1.8.2</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on May 20, 2015 </span>

<p>In accordance with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/">our security release policy</a>, the Django team is issuing Django 1.8.2. This release is now available on PyPI and our <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/">download page</a>. This release addresses a security issue detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch has also been updated.</p>

<h3>CVE-2015-3982 - Fixed session flushing in the <tt class="docutils literal">cached_db</tt> backend</h3>
<p>A change to <tt class="docutils literal">session.flush()</tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal">cached_db</tt> session backend
in Django 1.8 mistakenly sets the session key to an empty string
rather than <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>. An empty string is treated as a valid session
key and the session cookie is set accordingly. Any users with an empty
string in their session cookie will use the same session store.
<tt class="docutils literal">session.flush()</tt> is called by <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.logout()</tt> and,
more seriously, by <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.login()</tt> when a user
switches accounts. If a user is logged in and logs in again to a
different account (without logging out) the session is flushed to
avoid reuse. After the session is flushed (and its session key becomes
<tt class="docutils literal">''</tt>) the account details are set on the session and the session is
saved. Any users with an empty string in their session cookie will now
be logged into that account.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sam Cooke for reporting the issue.</p>
