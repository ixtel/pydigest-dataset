<p>An SDK for building applications to work with OpenStack</p>








<p>The <tt><span class="pre">python-openstacksdk</span></tt> is a collection of libraries for building
applications to work with OpenStack clouds. The project aims to provide
a consistent and complete set of interactions with OpenStack’s many
services, along with complete documentation, examples, and tools.</p>
<p>This SDK is under active development, and in the interests of providing
a high-quality interface, the APIs provided in this release may differ
from those provided in future release.</p>
<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The following example simply connects to an OpenStack cloud and lists
the containers in the Object Store service.:</p>
<pre>from openstack import connection
conn = connection.Connection(auth_url="http://openstack:5000/v3",
                             project_name="big_project",
                             username="SDK_user",
                             password="Super5ecretPassw0rd")
for container in conn.object_store.containers():
   print(container.name)
</pre>
