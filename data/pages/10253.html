<p>I'm trying to make an application that automatically updates a Google Plus spreadsheet. In order to do this I had to set up <code>gspread</code>, which also requires pyOpenSSL in order to work. Without it, it throws this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CryptoUnavailableError: No crypto library available</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using <code>pip</code>, I type the command:</p>

<pre><code>pip install pyopenssl
</code></pre>

<p>And import using:</p>

<pre><code>from OpenSSL import SSL
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to run the code, I receive the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ImportError: No module named cryptography.hazmat.bindings.openssl.binding</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tried reinstalling pyOpenSSL multiple times, and also tried reinstalling the cryptography dependency (as well as attempting to install previous versions of pyOpenSSL).</p>

<p>This problem is documented a few times, but the only solution I haven't tried is doing a fresh install of python, or the OS. </p>

<p>Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.</p>
