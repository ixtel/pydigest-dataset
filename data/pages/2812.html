<html><body><div><div class="article-content"><p>Before we begin, I must talk about what I mean by editing, and what I intend to cover. I believe that the most important thing about editing is code completion. In this section I pay special attention to python although PyCharm offers superb code completion for other languages like SQL and JavaScript.<a class="footnote-reference" href="#webtools" id="id1">[1]</a></p><p>I start off with code completion, because if you're like me, you have little time and want to dive into the thick of things and code completion is what we want most out of an IDE.</p><p>Then, I talk about a couple of editor settings that help keep me sane.</p><div class="section" id="code-completion"><p>PyCharm's editor is very powerful and extensible. In this section we will go over some useful tools that I use to write less error prone code faster.</p><div class="section" id="smart-completion"><p>You get suggestions as you type. You can further enhance this by the following:</p><ul class="simple"><li>Collecting runtime information</li><li>Adding docstrings to functions and methods</li><li>Invoking <code>assert</code> statements</li></ul><div class="section" id="runtime-information"><p>Lets start with the easiest enhancement. All we need to do is check this box, and PyCharm will give you better code completion as you debug your program more:</p><img alt="Runtime info" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_07.png"/><p>If you ever get wrong suggestions for completion clear the caches. Running your tests in debug mode will also give PyCharm a better chance to get an understanding of the types that you're using.</p></div><div class="section" id="docstrings"><p>Writing docstrings helps PyCharm, but also helps developers gain a better understanding of the code that you have written. PyCharm <em>understands</em> docstrings and uses the information in them to give you code completion and give you warning signals if it thinks you're being inconsistent:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">"""</span>

<span class="sd">    :param a: A for apple</span>
<span class="sd">    :type a: str</span>

<span class="sd">    :param b: B for ball</span>
<span class="sd">    :type b: str</span>

<span class="sd">    :param c: C for cat</span>
<span class="sd">    :type c: str</span>

<span class="sd">    :return: The answer to everything is 42. Remember ye well!</span>
<span class="sd">    :rtype: int</span>
<span class="sd">    """</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">42</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">'__main__'</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div><p>In the example above, I've used PyCharm tells me that I'm being inconsistent:</p><img alt="PyCharm yells at me" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_10.png"/><p>But there's more! If you wrote docstrings, then PyCharm will give you a beautiful documentation popup about your variables (by using <em>quick documentation</em>):<a class="footnote-reference" href="#keymap" id="id2">[2]</a></p><img alt="Beautiful docs" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_11.png"/></div><div class="section" id="assert-statements"><p><code>assert</code> statements can help tell PyCharm what types you should expect. Please note that, <code>assert</code> statements are not overhead free, unlike docstrings. I would advise using them in tests, so that the <a class="reference internal" href="#runtime-information">debugger</a> can collect type information about your parameters. For example, the following will give code completions for <code>a</code> but not for <code>b</code>:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">42</span>
</pre></div><p>This is because PyCharm knows about <code>a</code>, and that its a string, but it doesn't know about <code>b</code>:</p><img alt="Code completion for b" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_12.png"/></div></div><div class="section" id="hippie-complete"><p>Hippie Complete or Cyclic completion is best explained with a video:</p><p class="external youtube"/><p>Basically, it completes the word based on previous words you've typed <em>in the same document</em>.</p></div><div class="section" id="spelling-correction"><p>PyCharm also offers spelling correction as a quick fix. If you misspell "massachussets" like so:</p><img alt="Spelling" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_16.png"/><p>Then you can try quick fixing it with <kbd class="light">‚å•</kbd> + <kbd class="light">return</kbd>. After you hit <kbd class="light">return</kbd> on the first option above, you should see correction options:</p><img alt="Correction options" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_17.png"/><p><em>This was a request on reddit</em></p></div><div class="section" id="language-injection"><p>Language Inject basically means that you can <em>inject</em> other languages into Python strings, and have python <em>recognize</em> those languages. This comes in really handy when you're trying to syntax highlighting for regex or html, but it goes further than that often providing code completion. In order to get language injection, one must invoke the <em>quick fix</em> command inside string delimiters (<code>''</code>).<a class="footnote-reference" href="#keymap" id="id3">[2]</a></p><p>Here is a video to demonstrate how language injection works:<a class="footnote-reference" href="#emmet" id="id4">[3]</a></p><p class="external youtube"/></div></div><div class="section" id="editor"><p>This part covers the settings regarding the editor for better workflow. The options I set are based on my own preferences and hence not scientifically tested but they <em>do</em> make <em>my</em> editing a lot faster. Take the following advice with a healthy dose of skepticism since what might work for me, might not work for you.</p><div class="section" id="font"><img alt="Consolas FTW!" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_13.png"/><p>Consolas is the only font that looks good on Windows, Mac and Linux. Consolas remains monospace regardless of whether it is bold or italic, and the only font that looks consistently good in PyCharm. I have tested this on Mac OSX Yosemite, Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu (14.04).<a class="footnote-reference" href="#gettingconsonlinux" id="id5">[4]</a></p><p>If you've had success with other fonts (especially in Linux), please do mention them in the comments.</p></div><div class="section" id="braces-and-quotes"><p>A lot of the time, I forget to put parentheses around things or quotes around strings. By enabling the following option, you can select text, and when you press <kbd class="light">"</kbd> or <kbd class="light">'</kbd> or <kbd class="light">(</kbd> or <kbd class="light">)</kbd>, instead of replacing the text with the character entered, it will surround the selection with quotes or parentheses:</p><img alt="Parens!" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_14.png"/></div><div class="section" id="case-sensitive-completion"><p>By default, PyCharm comes with <em>first letter</em> case sensitivity, meaning that if you were to type <code>e</code>, <code>Exception</code> would not be offered as a viable completion. This is why I disable case sensitivity:</p><img alt="Case Sensitivity" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_15.png"/><p>Please note however, that on slower machines this does make code completion slower.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="up-next"><p>I will likely be covering how to deal with interpreters.</p></div><div class="section" id="previously"><p>I talked about a couple of things in <a class="reference external" href="http://nafiulis.me/pycharm-the-good-parts-i.html">part one</a>.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
