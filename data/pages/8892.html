<h2>Bugfix releases issued: 1.9.1 and 1.8.8</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on January 2, 2016 </span>

<p>Today we've issued bugfix releases for the 1.9 and 1.8 release series. Details can be found in the release notes for <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.9.1/">1.9.1</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.8.8/">1.8.8</a>.</p>
<p>The release package and checksums are available from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a>, as well as from the Python Package Index. The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
<p>On a related note: Python 3.2 users, please be advised that we've decided to drop support for Python 3.2 in Django 1.8.x at the end of 2016. We won't break things intentionally after that, but we won't test subsequent releases against Python 3.2 either. Upstream support for Python 3.2 ends February 2016 so we don't find much value in providing security updates for a version of Python that could be insecure. To read more about the decision and to let us know if this will be problematic for you, please read the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/eMu5UQpUdWs/discussion">django-developers thread</a>.</p>
