<html><body><div><p id="badges-end">Most people used to networking programming are aware that NetCat is a very useful tool
to establish and test TCP/UDP connections on the fly. The ZeroMQ community, however, do
not provide an equivalent application. So that, in order to test your ZMQ sockets, you
would have to code your own solution. For tackling that issue, the Zeroless Command
Line Interface (CLI) was created.</p>
<p>So that you can test your 0MQ connections in a language agnostic fashion, despite the
used messaging pattern.</p>

usage: Zeroless Server Cli <span class="o">[</span>-h<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>-n amount of parts<span class="o">]</span>
                           <span class="o">[</span>a port between <span class="m">1024</span> and 65535<span class="o">]</span>

The Zeroless Server Cli shall create an endpoint <span class="k">for</span> accepting connections
and <span class="nb">bind</span> it to the chosen ØMQ messaging pattern

positional arguments:
  <span class="o">[</span>a port between <span class="m">1024</span> and 65535<span class="o">]</span>
                        the open port to bind/connect to

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this <span class="nb">help</span> message and <span class="nb">exit</span>
  -n amount of parts, --numParts amount of parts
                        the amount of parts <span class="o">(</span>i.e. frames<span class="o">)</span> per message
                        <span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">default</span><span class="o">=</span>1<span class="o">)</span>

messaging pattern:
  The ØMQ API implements several messaging patterns, each one defining a
  particular network topology
