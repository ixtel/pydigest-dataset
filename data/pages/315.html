<p>Port of the Tulip project (asyncio module, PEP 3156) on Python 2</p>








<p>Trollius provides infrastructure for writing single-threaded concurrent
code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other
resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.
Here is a more detailed list of the package contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>a pluggable event loop with various system-specific implementations;</li>
<li>transport and protocol abstractions (similar to those in <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/" rel="nofollow">Twisted</a>);</li>
<li>concrete support for TCP, UDP, SSL, subprocess pipes, delayed calls, and
others (some may be system-dependent);</li>
<li>a <tt>Future</tt> class that mimics the one in the <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> module,
but adapted for use with the event loop;</li>
<li>coroutines and tasks based on generators (<tt>yield</tt>), to help write
concurrent code in a sequential fashion;</li>
<li>cancellation support for <tt>Future</tt>s and coroutines;</li>
<li>synchronization primitives for use between coroutines in a single thread,
mimicking those in the <tt>threading</tt> module;</li>
<li>an interface for passing work off to a threadpool, for times when you
absolutely, positively have to use a library that makes blocking I/O calls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trollius is a portage of the <a href="https://github.com/python/asyncio" rel="nofollow">asyncio project</a> (<a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/" rel="nofollow">PEP 3156</a>) on Python 2. Trollius works on
Python 2.6-3.5. It has been tested on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and
OpenIndiana.</p>
