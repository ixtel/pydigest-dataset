                <p>Pony ORM uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing">"multi-licensing"</a> scheme.

                    The "server" means one instance of a physical or a virtual server.
                    The Pony ORM license doesn't limit the number of cores per server.
                    You can run as many processes with Pony ORM inside the server as you need.
                    There are no restrictions on using Pony ORM on developer machines
                    (when a developer works with Pony ORM running on the same computer).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The personal license is tied to a individual developer name and the enterprise license is tied to a company name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Purchasing a license is a one-time payment. You are free to use the version you purchased on your web site indefinitely, there is no time limit.

                    The license will also be valid for all version updates until Pony ORM version 2.0.
                    However, after we release Pony ORM version 2.x, then using the new version will require a license upgrade.

                <h3>Licensing: Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Why AGPL? (and not GPL)</dt>
                    <dd>
                        AGPL was designed in order to close the GPL's "loophole", when someone can use software over
                        a computer network without violating GPL
                        and hence without the necessity to publish the derived work in order to contribute back to the
                        open source community.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>How can Pony ORM be both open source and commercially licensed?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing">"multi-licensing"</a>.
                        There is a number of products which were released under such terms (examples include
                        MySQL, VirtualBox, Berkley DB, NetBeans IDE, Asterisk and more).
                        Since Pony ORM LLC holds all the copyrights to the Pony ORM code, we are free to choose the
                        terms under which we license the code to our customers, or the open-source community.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Why multi-licensing?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        We, like other companies, believe that multi-licensing gives both developers and users the
                        best of two worlds. While anyone is free to look at the code and even improve it, commercial
                        licenses give users a tool which speed-ups the development process and allows to achieve business goals faster.
                        The commercial licenses support both our business and the open-source community, and vice versa.
