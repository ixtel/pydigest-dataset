<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I use an Eye-Fi SD card in my portable scanner. Unfortunately, it used
to upload directly to Evernote, but no longer supports uploading
directly to any service that suits my needs. Additionally, they don’t
provide a Linux version of their server software.</p>
<p>EyeFlask is a simple Flask-based Eye-Fi server written for Python &gt;=
3.4. The Eye-Fi card can connect to it and will upload images to the
folder specified in the config. EyeFlask attempts to verify the file
integrity using the same security protocols used by Eye-Fi Server.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting / FAQ</h3>
<div id="where-do-i-find-my-upload-key">
<h4>Where do I find my upload key?</h4>
<p>You’ll need a supported platform (OS X or Windows) with
<tt><span class="pre">Eye-Fi</span> Center.app</tt> installed, and need to have uploaded photos to
that computer at least once. This ensures everything is working, and
generates the <tt>Settings.xml</tt> file, from which you need to copy the
upload key into <tt>instance/eyeflask.cfg</tt>.</p>
<ul>
<li>OS X: <tt><span class="pre">~/Library/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml</span></tt></li>
<li>Windows 7: <tt><span class="pre">C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\Eye-Fi\Settings.xml</span></tt>

<h4>Is it okay to be running this with the built-in Flask server?</h4>
<p>It’s not perfect, but it seems to work okay for me and my single Eye-Fi
card setup. You’d probably be better off running it behind
<a href="http://gunicorn.org" rel="nofollow">gunicorn</a> or a gunicorn / nginx setup, but I’m
running it behind Flask alone for simplicity and because I haven’t had
any issues so far.</p>
