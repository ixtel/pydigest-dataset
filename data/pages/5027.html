<p>As of now, I am using Python-docx to convert the text in a .docx file into a single string. </p>

<pre><code>f = open(os.path.expanduser("~/documents/myFile.docx"))

document = opendocx(f)

docString = ''.join(getdocumenttext(document))
</code></pre>

<p>I am then parsing the string using simple built-in Python split methods.
Once the string is parsed into a list, I am loading that list into a MySQL database. This works great, but my only problem is I want to preserve the special characters. </p>

<p>The database supports these special character (utf-8) but a lot of characters and formatting (italics, bold, etc.) are lost when I convert the .docx into a string. </p>

<p>I want to be able to parse and load text with the formatting intact from the .docx file. </p>
