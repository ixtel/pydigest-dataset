<p>SQLAlchemy release 1.0.0 is now available.</p>
<p>Release 1.0.0 marks the tenth major SQLAlchemy series and occurs
within the tenth year of the SQLAlchemy project overall;  development
started in 2005 and the release of 0.1.0 was in February of 2006.</p>
<p>Calls for SQLAlchemy to go "1.0" started early on, as early as version
0.3 (!).   However, the magnitude of the task taken on by SQLAlchemy
was much broader than that; the development
philosophy taken by the project is one of slowly building out
a wide-reaching base of functionality, integrating many rounds of
refactoring and rethinks over a long period of time and building
new paradigms and features on top only as the foundation matures enough
to support them.</p>
<p>Users of 1.0 have the benefit of ten years of production
deployments, total rethinks of core APIs in early versions, a
vast number of API additions and refinements over later versions,
at least a dozen major internal rearchitectures, and as always a relentless
focus on improving performance.</p>
<p>The SQLAlchemy project could not be what it is today without the
unbelievable support, input, and sheer love of the user community -
from the vast amounts of knowledge and improvements gained from
tens of thousands of mailing list messages, to the improvements
hammered out through over three thousand bug reports, to the amazing
developers all around the world who have presented talks and tutorials
on SQLAlchemy and of course the audiences who continue to attend them,
to the bloggers and book authors supporting our community,
to the tweeters sending gratitude our way,
to our many hundreds of contributors of patches and pull requests, as well
as financial contributors who have consistently supported SQLAlchemy's
hosting costs, as well as more than a few burritos ;).</p>
<p>In particular, SQLAlchemy's success was made possible by its original
developer team, and I would like to express to all of them my very deep
gratitude for their tremendous efforts towards contributing code and
wisdom to the project, as well as support of my work from very early on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Jason Kirtland</li>
<li>Gaëtan de Menten</li>
<li>Diana Clarke</li>
<li>Michael Trier</li>
<li>Philip Jenvey</li>
<li>Ants Aasma</li>
<li>Paul Johnston</li>
<li>Jonathan Ellis</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd also like to thank Simon King and Jonathan Vanasco for their ongoing
contributions towards the mailing list, Alex Grönholm,
creator of the excellent <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlacodegen">sqlacodegen</a>
project, for his energetic and ubiquitous support of thousands of IRC
users, and Sanjiv Singh, early developer of <a class="reference external" href="http://geoalchemy.org/">GeoAlchemy</a>,
for the awesome set of drink coasters I use every day :).</p>
<p>Release 1.0.0 features an array of usability enhancements, new features,
bug fixes, and considerable performance enhancements.   After five short
beta releases, it is anticipated that the impact of upgrading from 0.9 or
even 0.8 to 1.0.0 should be minimal; however in all cases, users are
highly encouraged to carefully read through the behavioral enhancements
and changes documented in the 1.0 migration notes, at
