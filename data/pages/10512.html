<p>I have created a python <a href="https://gitlab.com/dvenkatsagar/python-yad/blob/2c1fb0379d425fdc5474f1ab4f2fe38219a1ff8d/python-yad/yad.py" rel="nofollow">interface</a> for the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/yad-dialog/" rel="nofollow">yad</a> program. What the code basically does is that, it generates a string which gets passed to the <code>yad</code> program using pythons <code>subprocess</code> and/or <code>pexpect</code> module and executes it</p>

<p>Now, Im facing a weird bug where I am trying to display a simple [multi]progress bar and update the bar with a certain value like this:</p>

<pre><code>import yad, time

yad = yad.YAD()

x = yad.Progress(autoclose=True) # yad.MultiProgress(autoclose=True)

for i in range(0,105,5):
  print(i)
  x(i,msg=str(i)+"% done")
  time.sleep(0.5)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that, in python 2.7, it works fine(updates the bar, and closes after wards), But when it comes to python 3.4, it does not work(shows the bar, but does not update, even though the <code>for</code> loop prints the numbers).</p>

<p>Im trying to figure out what the problem is with my interface. The functions are written in such a way that, it should update the bar, but for some reason its not working in python 3.4. </p>

<p>Kindly help me with this problem. I am not able to figure out where the bug is.</p>

<p>Edit : <code>x</code> is a function that is returned as output when we call the <code>yad.Progress()</code>. Using the <code>x</code>, we can write some standard input to the yad. The shell equivalent of the code would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>yad --progress --auto-close
&gt; 5
&gt; # 5% done 
...
</code></pre>
