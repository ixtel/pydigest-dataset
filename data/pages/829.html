On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 14.0! It has been a long road to get here, but we’ve done it! </p><p>The highlights of this release are:</p><ul>
<li>Twisted Positioning (`twisted.positioning`) makes its entry into Twisted! It comes ready to talk with common GPS devices, and will supersede `twisted.protocols.gps`.</li>
<li>A wealth of SSL/TLS improvements, including ECDHE support, TLS Service Identity (with service_identity on PyPI), a stronger default set of ciphers, and strengthening against attacks such as CRIME. A Twisted Web server with pyOpenSSL 0.14 is capable of getting an A in Qualys SSL Labs tests out of the box, and A+ with small application modifications. Twisted Agent can also now do HTTPS hostname verification.</li>
<li>Python 3 improvements, including the ability for `pip install` to install all ported modules.</li>
<li>Twisted Pair’s TUN/TAP support has been overhauled, with documentation and full test coverage.</li>
<li>Significant documentation improvements, including more API documentation for Twisted Mail &amp; Twisted Names, narrative documentation for Twisted Names, and a migration to Sphinx for building Twisted narrative docs.</li>
<li>Support is dropped for pyOpenSSL older than 0.10 and Windows XP.</li>
</ul><p>
