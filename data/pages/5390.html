<h2 id="Hypothesis-Testing-and-p-values">Hypothesis Testing and p-values<a class="anchor-link" href="#Hypothesis-Testing-and-p-values">Â¶</a></h2><p>Closely related to confidence intervals is <strong>hypothesis testing</strong>. Generally speaking, you start with a <strong>null hypothesis</strong> and an <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> (that is opposite the null). Then, you check whether the data supports <strong>rejecting the null hypothesis</strong> or <strong>failing to reject the null hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<p>(Note that "failing to reject" the null is not the same as "accepting" the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis may indeed be true, except that you just don't have enough data to show that.)</p>
<p>As it relates to model coefficients, here is the conventional hypothesis test:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>null hypothesis:</strong> There is no relationship between TV ads and Sales (and thus $\beta_1$ equals zero)</li>
<li><strong>alternative hypothesis:</strong> There is a relationship between TV ads and Sales (and thus $\beta_1$ is not equal to zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we test this hypothesis? Intuitively, we reject the null (and thus believe the alternative) if the 95% confidence interval <strong>does not include zero</strong>. Conversely, the <strong>p-value</strong> represents the probability that the coefficient is actually zero:</p>
