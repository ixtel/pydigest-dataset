<p>I have scoured the web (including the 6 links that show similar problems with Heroku, Anaconda etc but common root cause - resource corpora/wordnet not found) and performed all that I could which includes but is not limited to -</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing the download directory (and subsequently setting nltk_data path by 3 methods as below) 3 times to /usr/lib/nltk_data, /home/ubuntu/nltk_data and /home/ubuntu/quepy/nltk_data.</li>
<li>Changed the path by (i) changing the NLTK_DATA_PATH in settings.py in the required quepy app for all three paths (ii) using the nltk.data.path.append command for all three paths (iii) using the export NLTK_DATA command for all three paths</li>
<li>I even went on to give permission 644 to the contents of nltk_data directory recursively</li>
<li>Used the python -m nltk.downloader AND nltk.download command with the specific paths to install and configured the paths (they both do the same thing)</li>
</ol>

<p>Even after 3 hours of trying I am nowhere. I would really appreciate if anyone could point me on how to successfully run the Quepy example (python main.py "Who is Tom Cruise?") at location: quepy/examples/dbpedia. It is not a problem with Quepy but why on Earth can it not find the resource.</p>

<p>Here is the exact error - </p>

<pre><code>Resource u'corpora/wordnet' not found.  Please use the NLTK
Downloader to obtain the resource:  &gt;&gt;&gt; nltk.download()

Searched in:

  - 'home/ubuntu/nltk_data'
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE - </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I installed it successfully on another machine without a problem and it ran correctly but on the initial machine the problem is still unresolved, exact same steps, exact version of the app and its related tools/dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though not showing in the error log my class-paths start with a slash as observed by nltk.data.path</p></li>
