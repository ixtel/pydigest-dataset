<h1>Please Do My Homework<a class="headerlink" href="#please-do-my-homework" title="Permalink to this headline">Âś</a></h1>
<p>Reminiscent of <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.aclark.net/2012/05/23/a-simple-printer-of-nested-lists/">this phenomenon</a>, I’m slowly being driven insane by Redditors asking <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Python">/r/Python</a> to do their homework for them. E.g.</p>
<img alt="Question #1" class="img-thumbnail align-center" src="../../../../_images/homework1.png"/>
<p>In principle, and putting aside <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython">/r/learnpython</a>, I have no problem with Redditors asking questions on /r/Python that are better suited to /r/learnpython. E.g.</p>
<img alt="Question #2" class="img-thumbnail align-center" src="../../../../_images/homework2.png"/>
<p>But there is something about the current proliferation of homework questions on /r/Python that I find offensive.</p>
<img alt="Question #3" class="img-thumbnail align-center" src="../../../../_images/homework3.png"/>
<p>Perhaps it is due to:</p>
<p>1.) Less meaningful content. I read <a class="reference external" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Python">/r/Python</a> for Hacker News-like stories about Python. The more poorly written homework questions, the less meaningful content.</p>
<img alt="Question #4" class="img-thumbnail align-center" src="../../../../_images/homework4.png"/>
<p>2.) No prior meaningful attempt to resolve the issue. E.g. “Ive tried looking online, but to no avail [sic].” What did you try? How did that attempt fail?</p>
<img alt="Question #5" class="img-thumbnail align-center" src="../../../../_images/homework5.png"/>
<p>So now I feel compelled to try and discourage such posts and <strong>encourage more meaningful posts</strong>. If you learn nothing else in school, you should <strong>learn how to learn</strong>. It’s not the answer to the question that matters, it’s <strong>how you get there</strong>. No other aspect of you answering a question or completing an assignment is as important as you <strong>thinking for yourself about how to do it</strong>. This is almost the entire point of higher education: to learn <strong>how to function in the real world</strong>.</p>
<img alt="Question #6" class="img-thumbnail align-center" src="../../../../_images/homework6.png"/>
<p>In the real world, you cannot say to your friends and/or coworkers:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>My boss is such a jerk. If you could just give me a working example of how to do my job, that would be awesome! Lolz.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So please, /r/Python, let’s <strong>start asking more meaningful questions</strong>. And if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.</p>
