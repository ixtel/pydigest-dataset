<p>I'm trying to use autodoc for selected modules only. I've created a file which includes:</p>

<pre><code>.. automodule:: some.specific.module
   :members:
</code></pre>

<p>And it gets generated correctly. Unfortunately autodoc keeps trying to parse other files too (and fails because of import errors). I know I can mock out some modules, but I want a better solution - stop sphinx from looking at them to begin with.</p>

<p>How can I make sure only the requested module is loaded, and not (for example) <code>test.other.module</code>.</p>
