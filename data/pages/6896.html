<pre>Hello everyone,

I'm excited to announce the new SciPy Central website is live at
central.scipy.org.

The URLs from the old domain scipy-central.org hosted by Kevin will be
redirected to the latest.

Major improvements on front-end
-------------------------------

1. New UI using Twitter Bootstrap 2.3
2. Comments system for submissions
3. Preview during submission is simplified
4. RSS/Atom feeds for submissions, comments
5. ACE Editor to show code snippets, and highlight syntax

Possible future improvements
----------------------------

1. OpenID integration to login. I'm thinking of Google Identity Toolkit
&lt;<a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/toolkit/web/">https://developers.google.com/identity/toolkit/web/</a>&gt; now
2. Up/down voting submissions. Its great if someone wants to improve this
&lt;<a href="https://github.com/ksurya/SciPyCentral/tree/thumbs">https://github.com/ksurya/SciPyCentral/tree/thumbs</a>&gt;
3. Cookbooks integration + iPyNb support. Any ideas on how to integrate
iPython Notebooks would be great. Possibly, we may want to rethink
different submission types.

Thanks to Clever Cloud for kindly providing hosting services to our open
source project at no cost.
