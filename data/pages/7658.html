<h3>Moving many tasks to another list (<cite>rtmmove</cite>)</h3>
<p>Moves all tasks fitting given query to list of specified name
(which will be created if is not present).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>rtmmove --list='Language learning' \
        --filter='list:"English Course" or tag:"French" or tag:German"
</pre>
<p>To verify what the command is to do without actually performing it
one can add <cite>–dry-run</cite> and <cite>–verbose</cite>. For example:</p>
<pre>rtmmove --list=Family  \
        --filter='(tag:paul or tag:jane) and status:"incomplete"' \
        --dry-run --verbose
</pre>

<h3>Importing data from Nozbe to RememberTheMilk (<cite>rtmimport</cite>)</h3>
<p><em>For obvious reasons (I already imported my data) I don’t test
this module on every release. Make dry run before actually running
the import and report bugs if they happen.</em></p>
<div id="exporting-the-data-from-nozbe">
<h4>Exporting the data from Nozbe</h4>
<p>Prepare <cite>.json</cite> export of <a href="http://nozbe.com" rel="nofollow">Nozbe</a> data. For details see <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mekk.nozbe/" rel="nofollow">mekk.nozbe</a>
but usually you just want to:</p>
<pre>nozbetool export --user=MyNozbeName --json=mynozbedata.json
</pre>
</div>
<div id="importing-data-to-rememberthemilk">
<h4>Importing data to RememberTheMilk</h4>
<p>First make a test run:</p>
<pre>rtmimport --nozbe-json=mynozbedata.json --verbose --dry-run
</pre>
<p>(it does not store anything, just prints what it is to do) and verify
whether everything seems correct.</p>
<p>Then make actual import:</p>
<pre>rtmimport --nozbe-json=mynozbedata.json --verbose
</pre>
<p>(or omit <cite>–verbose</cite> if you don’t want to track progress, but I
recommend you keep it)</p>
<p>Note: import can take some time. In case of my big list over
not-so-good network it has been running for almost an hour.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-the-data-is-converted">
<h4>How the data is converted</h4>
<p>Nozbe projects are saved as RememberTheMilk lists.</p>
<p>Nozbe contexts are converted to RememberTheMilk tags. <cite>@</cite> is prepended
to their names and non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with
dashes (so for example <cite>My home/kitchen</cite> becomes
<cite>@My-home-kitchen</cite>).</p>
<p>Next actions are tagged as <cite>Next</cite>.</p>
<p>Actions are saved as tasks. Name, due date, recurrence,
estimated cost and completion status are all saved.</p>
<p>In case of recurrence, RTM <tt>every</tt> mode is used (so the task marked
on Nozbe as recurring every week will be spawned 52 times a year by
RTM, whether user completes it, or not). If you prefer alternative way
(spawning new incarnation whenever previous is completed), edit tasks
after import, patch the code (and replace <cite>every</cite> with <cite>after</cite>), or
ask me for a commandline flag).</p>
<p>As notes are bound to projects on Nozbe, and to tasks on
RememberTheMilk, I save notes by creating artificial tasks named “Save
this note” (one per every list for which appropriate project had notes)
and binding notes to those tasks. This must be handled afterwards
using RTM interface, to make sure it happens I mark those tasks as due
immediately. Those task are also tagged as <cite>Note</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations">
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<p>Only main context is copied, additional contexts are lost. I don’t know
how to grab them from <a href="http://nozbe.com" rel="nofollow">Nozbe</a> (in case somebody knows how to patch
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mekk.nozbe/" rel="nofollow">mekk.nozbe</a> to grab all contexts, I can extend this importer easily
to handle them all).</p>
<p>Uploads are not copied at all. I neither now how to export them from
Nozbe, nor how could I handle them afterwards (RTM has no uploads).</p>
<p>Action name formatting is not available on RememberTheMilk, so if you
used constructs like <cite>Visit “the website”:http://google.com</cite>, they will
show up as is.</p>
<p>Sharing information (= information about delegations to other users)
is lost. I haven’t used this feature so I don’t know how do the
underlying data look like.</p>
<p>Some contexts could probably be converted to locations, not tags, but
I don’t have an idea how to decide which way to go.</p>
</div>
<div id="problems-and-workarounds">
<h4>Problems and workarounds</h4>
<p>If import process is interrupted, re-running it would make duplicate
tasks (there is no duplicate checking, it would be costly). The best
way to resolve it is to open .json file in text editor (after making a
backup copy of it) and simply cut all actions which are already saved
(they are saved in order, so it is just a matter of locating the last
action saved before the process was interrupted and cutting all actions
up to this one).</p>
