previews, group private messages, audible notifications,
missed-message emails, desktop apps, and much more.</p>

<p>First, subscribe to the Zulip <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zulip-devel">development discussion mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>The Zulip project uses a system of labels in our <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues">issue
tracker</a> to make it easy to
find a project if you don't have your own project idea in mind or want
to get some experience with working on Zulip before embarking on a
larger project you have in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/bite%20size">Bite Size</a>:
Smaller projects that could be a great first contribution.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/integrations">Integrations</a>.
Integrate Zulip with another piece of software and contribute it
back to the community!  Writing an integration can be a great
started project.  There's some brief documentation on the best way
to write integrations at <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/70">https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/70</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/documentation">Documentation</a>.
The Zulip project loves contributions of new documentation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/help%20wanted">Help Wanted</a>:
A broader list of projects that nobody is currently working on.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/Platform%20support">Platform support</a>.
These are open issues about making it possible to install Zulip on a wider
range of platforms.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/bug">Bugs</a>. Open bugs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/labels/enhancement">Feature requests</a>.
Browsing this list can be a great way to find feature ideas to implement that
other Zulip users are excited about.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're excited about helping with an open issue, just post on the
conversation thread that you're working on it.  You're encouraged to
ask questions on how to best implement or debug your changes -- the
Zulip maintainers are excited to answer questions to help you stay
unblocked and working efficiently.</p>

<p>We also welcome suggestions of features that you feel would be
valuable or changes that you feel would make Zulip a better open
source project, and are happy to support you in adding new features or
other user experience improvements to Zulip.</p>

<p>If you have a new feature you'd like to add, we recommend you start by
opening a GitHub issue about the feature idea explaining the problem
that you're hoping to solve and that you're excited to work on it.  A
Zulip maintainer will usually reply within a day with feedback on the
idea, notes on any important issues or concerns, and and often tips on
how to implement or test it.  Please feel free to ping the thread if
you don't hear a response from the maintainers -- we try to be very
responsive so this usually means we missed your message.</p>

<p>For significant changes to the visual design, user experience, data
model, or architecture, we highly recommend posting a mockup,
screenshot, or description of what you have in mind to zulip-devel@ to
get broad feedback before you spend too much time on implementation
details.</p>

<p>Finally, before implementing a larger feature, we highly recommend
looking at the new feature tutorial and coding style guidelines on
ReadTheDocs.</p>

<p>Feedback on how to make this development process more efficient, fun,
and friendly to new contributors is very welcome!  Just shoot an email
to the Zulip Developers list with your thoughts.</p>
