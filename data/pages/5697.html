<p>Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Information Framework</p>








<p>AIKIF - Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Information Framework</p>
<p>This is an information classification framework that maps structured or freeform data to
a standard knowledge store.</p>
<p>Manages a dataset of your applications, the source data, parameters, runs and results and then uses your business rules to convert and store the information in a machine usable format.</p>
<p>Your AI software can link to AIKIF by setting up logging watch-points to define success /
failure along with the range of input parameters. Goals and plans are defined by breaking
them down to smaller tasks until the task can be run by a tool in the Toolbox.</p>
<p>A tool is any python wrapped function or application and is easily extensible.</p>
