<h2>Security advisory: Strengthening the password hashes in your database</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on February 23, 2016 </span>

<p>Are the password hashes in your database strong enough to prevent them from being cracked if your database is compromised?</p>
<p>Django 0.90 stored passwords as unsalted MD5. Django 0.91 added support for salted SHA1 with automatic upgrade of passwords when a user logs in. Django 1.4 added PBKDF2 as the default password hasher.</p>
<p>If you have an old Django project with MD5 or SHA1 (even salted) encoded passwords, be aware that these can be cracked fairly easily with today's hardware. Consider using a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/passwords/#password-upgrading-without-requiring-a-login">wrapped password hasher</a> to strengthen the hashes in your database. Django 1.10 will <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.10/#removed-weak-password-hashers-from-the-default-password-hashers-setting">remove the MD5 and SHA1 hashers</a> from the default <tt class="docutils literal">PASSWORD_HASHERS</tt> setting to force projects to acknowledge continued use of a weak hasher.</p>
