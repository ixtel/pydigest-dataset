<h2>Django 1.9 beta 1 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on October 19, 2015 </span>

<p>As part of the Django 1.9 release process, today we've released Django 1.9
beta 1, a preview/testing package that represents the second stage in the 1.9
release cycle and an opportunity for you to try out the changes coming
in Django 1.9.</p>
<p>Django 1.9 has a myriad of goodies which you can read about in
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.9/">the in-development 1.9 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Only bugs in new features and regressions from earlier versions of Django will be
fixed between now and 1.9 final (also, translations will be updated following the
"string freeze" when the release candidate is issued). The <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.9Roadmap#schedule">current
release schedule</a> calls for a release
candidate about a month from now with the final release to follow about two weeks after that
around December 1. We'll only be able to keep this schedule
if we get early and often testing from the community. Updates on the release
schedule schedule are available <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/33itn-jSDIQ/discussion">on the django-developers mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>As with all alpha and beta packages, this is <strong>not</strong> for production use. But
if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue tracker</a>), you can grab a
copy of the beta package from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a> or on PyPI. As  always,
signed MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.9b1.checksum.txt">checksums</a> of the release are available.</p>
<p>The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
