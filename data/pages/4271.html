<h2 id="Overall-Strategy">Overall Strategy<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overall-Strategy">Â¶</a></h2><p>When Cheryl tells Albert <code>'May'</code> then <em>he</em> knows there are three possibilities, but <em>we</em> (the puzzle solvers) don't, because we don't know what Cheryl said. So what can we do? We will consider <em>all</em> of the possible dates, one at a time. For example, first consider <code>'May 15'</code>. Cheryl tells Albert <code>'May'</code> and Bernard <code>'15'</code>, giving them the lists of possible birthdates shown above.  We can then check whether statements 3 through 5 are true in this scenario.  If they are, then <code>'May 15'</code> is a solution to the puzzle.  Repeat the process for each of the  possible dates. If all goes well, there should be exactly one solution.</p>
<p>Here is the main function, <code>cheryls_birthday</code>:</p>
