<pre>Just so people know, over at the datetime-sig I've accepted PEP 495, which
adds a fold flag to datetime objects to distinguish ambiguous times. This
enables roundripping of conversions for those times where the local clock
is moved backward (creating ambiguous times that could not be distinguished
before).

I would like to thank Alexander and Tim for their unrelenting work on this.
The idea seems simple, but the details were excruciatingly hard to get
right, given the strict backwards compatibility requirements.

There may well be additional beneficial changes to the datetime module. The
datetime-sig is now open for their discussion. However, proposals that
break backwards compatibility are a waste of everybody's time, so be
prepared to explain how your proposal does not break existing code that
works under Python 3.5.
