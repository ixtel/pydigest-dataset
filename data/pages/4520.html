<p>How can we query connected USB devices info in Python?
I want to get UID Device Name (ex: SonyEricsson W660), path to device (ex: /dev/ttyACM0)</p>

<p>And also what would be the best Parameter out of above info to be used as identifying the device whenever it's connected again? (UID?)</p>

<p>I am working on Ubuntu 11.04.</p>

<p>ATM I have this code (using pyUSB)</p>

<pre><code>busses = usb.busses()
for bus in busses:
  devices = bus.devices
  for dev in devices:
    print repr(dev)
    print "Device:", dev.filename
    print "  idVendor: %d (0x%04x)" % (dev.idVendor, dev.idVendor)
    print "  idProduct: %d (0x%04x)" % (dev.idProduct, dev.idProduct)
    print "Manufacturer:", dev.iManufacturer
    print "Serial:", dev.iSerialNumber
    print "Product:", dev.iProduct
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is I don't get desired output, will paste one example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;usb.legacy.Device object at 0x1653990&gt;
Device: 
  idVendor: 4046 (0x0fce)
  idProduct: 53411 (0xd0a3)
Manufacturer: 1
Serial: 3
Product: 2
</code></pre>

<p>First I don't get filename, it's most important to me. I am assuming it is the /dev/ttyACM0 etc part. Second, I guess there was some UID of every USB device, or I should use both Vendor or Product id?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Apparently I have some setup issues, I think I am using wrong USB Library. (using libusb0.1) ATM. That's why I get Device (dev.filename) string empty. If someone can please just tell that on what operating system he is using what USB Library and what version of PyUSB I think it will solve my problems.</strong></p>
