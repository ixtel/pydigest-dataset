WAMP has a lot of potential, but it's asynchronous and most current Python Web stacks are synchronous. Still, you may want to benefit from WAMP realtime notifications right now in your synchronous applications. Crossbar.io enables you to trigger realtime notifications from your synchronous Python Web stack since it comes with a HTTP Pusher service: just configure a few lines of JSON in the Crossbar.io config file, and Crossbar.io provides a HTTP REST endpoint so that you can publish to a WAMP topic with a simple POST request.<br/>

Learn how to code web apps and get on the path to building your next side project, your lifestyle business, or your startup. This book doesn't walk you through a specific tutorial, but instead uses a generic example (a "collection of things") to allow you to create something using Python and Django that interests you. A blog is a collection of posts, a store is a collection of products, a directory is a collection of people. The possibilities are endless! Learn by doing--creating a project unique to you while teaching yourself how to build a web app.<br/>

PaymentWorks is all built on Django and Backbone.js, and hosted on AWS. So how exactly do you get a big secure production network built on AWS? How do you make sense of all the different services and components? What about loading balancing? Firewalls? And how do you deploy software? What about continuous integration? Please come join us for a discussion on Django and AWS. We'll discuss how the PaymentWorks team does it, what works well, what doesn't and hopefully we'll answer a few of your questions in the process.<br/>
