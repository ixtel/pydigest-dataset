<p>
While working at the </p><i>DOS command line</i><p> in </p><i>Windows</i><p>, I had the idea of using the </p><a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=DOS+tasklist">DOS TASKLIST</a><p> command along with </p><a href="https://google.com/search?q=xtopdf">xtopdf, my PDF generation toolkit</a><p>, to generate a </p><i>list of currently running Windows tasks</i><p> to a </p><i>PDF</i><p> file, along with some other info, such as whether a task is a </p><i>service</i><p> or a </p><i>console process</i><p>, the </p><i>process id</i><p>, the </p><i>memory usage</i><p>, etc. The TASKLIST command shows all that information, by default.
</p><p>
I also sorted the output in ascending order by the </p><i>Mem Usage</i><p> field, by passing it through the DOS </p><i>SORT</i><p> command. (I could have sorted it by any other field such as the Image Name or the PID, of course.) I starred out some of the fields in the output.
</p><p>
Here are the </p><b>steps</b><p> to generate a Windows task list as a PDF, using xtopdf:
</p><p>
( I use $ as the prompt, even in DOS :)
</p><p>
1: Run TASKLIST and redirect its output to a text file.
</p><p>
$ tasklist &gt; tasklist.out
</p><p>
2: Sort the file into another file.
</p><p>
$ sort /+65 tasklist.out &gt; tasklist.srt
</p><p>
(Sort the output of TASKLIST by the character position of the Mem Usage field.)
</p><p>
3: Go edit tasklist to put the header lines back at the top :)</p><p>
[ They get dislodged by the sort. ]
</p><p>
[ This is not Unix, so you can't easily do the fast, fluid command-line data munging that you can on Unix, unless you use something like </p><i>Cygwin</i><p> or </p><i>UWin</i><p>.
</p><p>
UWin was developed by </p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Korn_(computer_scientist)">David Korn</a><p>, creator of the Korn Shell, for Windows. You can get UWin from the </p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWIN">AT&amp;T site here</a><p> (after doing a convoluted license agreement dance, last time I checked). But IMO, the dance is not too long, and is worth it, to get a suite of Unix tools that work well on Windows, and UWin is also smaller &amp; lighter than Cygwin, though not so comprehensive. </p><p>
Be sure to read the section "Korn shell and Microsoft" at the David Korn link above :-) ]
</p><p>
4: Pipe the sorted task list to StdinToPDF, to generate the PDF output.
</p><p>
$ type tasklist.srt | python StdinToPDF.py tasklist.pdf
</p><p>
We just pipe the output of TASKLIST to </p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.in/2013/12/xtopdf-pdfwriter-can-create-pdf-from.html">StdinToPDF.py</a><p> (an </p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.com/search/label/xtopdf">xtopdf app</a><p>), which can be used at the end of any arbitrary command pipeline that generates text (on Unix / Windows / Linux / Mac OS X), to convert that text to PDF.
</p><p>
A screenshot of the PDF output I got (viewed in Foxit PDF Reader), is shown at the top of this post.
</p><p>
- Enjoy.
