<h1>Python on Rails</h1>
</p>
<p>Victor Levy (Senior Consultant, Princeton Consultants) talks about COSMA (CSX Onboard Systems Management Agent). COSMA is a Python application hosted on locomotives, designed to monitor, check out, and upgrade safety-related locomotive systems. In this illuminating talk, Victor discusses the challenges of Python programming for train systems and how COSMA works.</p>
<p>Positive Train Control (PTC) is an automated safety system required for all Class-1 railroads and locomotives to implement. The system detects dangerous situations and warns the crew to take action. It can also automatically take action itself if the crew does not respond.</p>
<p>For PTC, locomotives need new equipment on board including computers, displays, radios, radio towers, and onboard routing servers. With all the new equipment comes a great need to make sure they are running correctly, upgraded when needed, and monitored.</p>
