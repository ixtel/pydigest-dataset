<p>You can update uniforms between draw calls, that's how they are meant to be used. </p>

<p>Looking at the pasted code, and as pointed out in the comments, lines 167..169 should work by chance for small texIds, but you should really change</p>

<pre><code>glUniform1i(textureUnif, model.texId)
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0+model.texId)
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, model.texId)
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>glUniform1i(textureUnif, 0)
glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0)
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, model.texId)
</code></pre>

<p>though since all you use is <code>GL_TEXTURE0</code>, you only really need the <code>glBindTexture()</code> call on each loop iteration. The texture uniform should contain the texture unit, the shader has no concept of texture id in this case.</p>

<p>Of course, this being OpenGL, errors are often hard to find. What are you actually trying to draw? Screenshots would be helpful.</p>

<p>It might well be that something else in the OpenGL state results in the uniform update not showing up on the screen, for example depth testing is one common culprit.</p>
