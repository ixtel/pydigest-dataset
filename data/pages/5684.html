<p>A dependency injection system for python</p>








<p>Fang is a dependency injection library for Python.</p>
<p>Fang adds dependency injection in Pythonic way, without requiring the elements more usually seen in “big OO” languages. Particularly:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>dependencies are specified by identifier strings, rather than strict interface classes or types.</li>
<li>the constructs which meet dependencies (resource providers) are <em>just functions</em>, not factory classes.</li>
<li>the dependencies which a piece of code needs and the dependencies it can provide are both declared concisely with decorators.</li>
<li>the linking of dependents and resource providers is done at run-time <em>in Python</em>, not with a custom-built configuration language.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The pieces used are small and easy to understand: the total library is less than 300 lines. But it’s clear and simple enough to serve as a foundation for other features (eg dependency graphs, interface verification), which can enabled or added on a per-project basis.</p>
