<h2>Django sprint in Amsterdam, The Netherlands</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee and Erik Romijn</strong> on February 23, 2015 </span>

<p>We're very happy to announce that a two-day Django sprint will take place on March 7-8 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. This event is organized by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangovereniging.nl/">Dutch Django Association</a>.</p>
<p>The venue is the office of <a class="reference external" href="https://dashcare.nl">DashCare</a> just outside the center of Amsterdam. The sprint will start on Saturday, March 7th at 9:30 CET and and finish on Sunday, March 8th around 22:00 CET.</p>
<p>With the help of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangovereniging.nl/">Dutch Django Association</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.divio.ch/en/">Divio</a> we will have four core developers on site: Baptiste Mispelon, Markus Holtermann, Daniele Procida and Erik Romijn. Daniele will also be doing his famed “Don’t be afraid to commit” workshop, which will take people new to contributing to Django through the entire contribution process with real tickets. So please don’t hesitate to join even if you’ve never contributed to Django before.</p>
<p>If you'd like to join, please <a class="reference external" href="http://www.meetup.com/dutch-django-assocation/events/220368460/">sign up on the meetup page</a>.
If you’re unable to come to Amsterdam, you're welcome to contribute to the sprint online. Sprinters and core developers will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.freenode.net/django-sprint">#django-sprint IRC channel on FreeNode</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you can join us and help make the sprint as successful as possible!</p>
