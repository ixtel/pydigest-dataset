<h2>Django 1.8 alpha 1 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on January 16, 2015 </span>

<p>As part of the Django 1.8 release process, today we've released Django 1.8
alpha 1, a preview/testing package that represents the first stage in the 1.8
release cycle and an opportunity for you to try out some of the changes coming
in Django 1.8.</p>
<p>Django 1.8 is loaded with several major new features and a cornucopia of other
improvements. Highlights include native support for multiple template engines,
support for complex SQL expressions via the ORM, a formalized API for
<tt class="docutils literal">Model._meta</tt>, and new PostgreSQL specific functionality in <tt class="docutils literal">contrib.postgres</tt>.</p>
<p>For full details, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.8/">the in-development 1.8 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike in past release cycles where we permitted new features up until beta,
this alpha milestone marks a complete feature freeze. Thus, this alpha should
be much closer to the final release than in past release cycles. The <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.8Roadmap#schedule">current
release schedule</a> calls for a beta release in about a month and a release
candidate about a month from then. We'll only be able to keep this schedule
if we get early and often testing from the community.</p>
<p>As with all alpha and beta packages, this is <strong>not</strong> for production use. But
if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue tracker</a>), you can grab a
copy of the alpha package from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a>. And as always, signed
MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.8a1.checksum.txt">checksums</a> of the 1.8 alpha package are available.</p>
<p>The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
