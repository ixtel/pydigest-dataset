        attend to many details.  A small one that is often overlooked: comments
        should be complete sentences.   (Throughout, "comment"
        includes docstrings and any other English you write about your code.) 
        Start comments with a capital, have a
        subject and a verb, and end them with a period.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this.  First, your program should be
        readable.  Just as you choose variable names to have meaning so that
        people can read your code, you should write your comments so that
        people can read them.  Capitals are a clear indication of the start of
        a sentence, and a period is a clear indication of the end:</p><blockquote class="code"><code><span class="c"># BAD:</span><br/><span class="c"># try to read the thing</span><br/><br/><span class="c"># BETTER:</span><br/><span class="c"># Try to read the thing.</span><br/></code></blockquote><p>Is that first comment complete? Was there meant to be a qualifying
        clause?  The thing that what?  Sure, the second sentence doesn't
        explain the thing either, but at least we can see that the author
        didn't just wander away in the middle of a thought.</p><p>By writing complete sentences you are more likely to include some small
        helper that will get your meaning across, and people will be better
        able to grasp what your words mean. Isn't that why you wrote them?</p><p>The second reason to write complete sentences is to focus you on what
        you are writing.  You think about each statement in your program, why
        aren't you thinking about the comments?  Maybe if you capitalize and
        punctuate your text, you'll realize that a few grunted words aren't
        really what you want to put there:</p><blockquote class="code"><code><span class="c"># EVEN BETTER:</span><br/><span class="c"># Try to read the configuration file, but it's OK if</span><br/><span class="c"># it's missing because we don't require a config file.</span><br/></code></blockquote><p>Some would argue that this comment is too many words, that you shouldn't
        explain in that much detail, that the code should be more
        self-explanatory.  That's great, now you're thinking about what the
        comment is doing, and making them better.  I'm not suggesting writing
        longer comments just for bulk, if you can say it in fewer words, do,
        but make them good words in a complete sentence.</p><p>Paying more attention to the comments will help you write better code.
        I can't tell you how many times I've written what I thought was a
        perfecty good function or line of code, then gone to write the comment
        or docstring, and realized a better way to do it, or even just a better
        name.  Explaining yourself to others is a really good way to understand
        what you are doing. Understanding what you are doing is a really good
        way to write good code.</p><p>Another reason to make your comments complete sentences: it makes it
        easier to extend them later:</p><blockquote class="code"><code><span class="c"># ORIGINALLY:</span><br/><span class="c"># try to read the thing</span><br/><br/><span class="c"># THEN SOMEONE ADDS:</span><br/><span class="c"># try to read the thing. Don't worry if it</span><br/><span class="c"># doesn't exist</span><br/></code></blockquote><p>The person who adds the second sentence had to add the period to the
        first, and now it looks really strange that the second sentence is
        unterminated. If the first sentence had been a real sentence, the
        second sentence could be added naturally.</p><p>Many coders will look at this advice and complain that it is way too
        nit-picking, that punctuation in comments is irrelevant, that since
        it's natural language, it's readable as it is, we don't have to worry
        about trivialities like punctuation they are wrong text needs
        punctuation to be readable leaving it out just makes it hard to parse
        the sentences see what i did there?</p><p>One last reason for full sentences: the programming variant of the 
        <a class="offsite" rel="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken
        windows theory</a> says that if you take care of small things,
        others are more likely to take care of the bigger things.  Polished
        code is more likely to be maintained well and will set the tone for
        more polished code in the future.</p><p>And isn't that what we all want? Write complete sentences.</p></div>
