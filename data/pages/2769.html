<p>I want to calculate the time of user's mouse events in Pygame, if user doesn't move his mouse about 15 seconds, then I want to display a text to the screen. I tried <code>time</code> module for that, but it's not working.</p>

<pre><code>import pygame,time

pygame.init()

#codes
...
...

font = pygame.font.SysFont(None,25)
text = font.render("Move your mouse!", True, red)

FPS = 30

while True:
    #codes
    ... 
    ...
    start = time.time()
    cur = pygame.mouse.get_pos() #catching mouse event 
    end = time.time()
    diff = end-start
    if 15 &lt; diff:
        gameDisplay.blit(text,(10,500))

    pygame.display.update()

    clock.tick(FPS)

pygame.quit()
quit()
</code></pre>

<p>Well output is not what I want, I don't know how to calculate it if user doesn't move his mouse.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I want to write a text when user's mouse in a special area, it's working like;</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>if 100 &lt; cur[0] &lt; 200 and 100 &lt; cur[1] &lt; 200:
        gameDisplay.blit(text,(10,500))
</code></pre>

<p>But how can I calculate? I even couldn't find how to tell Python, user's mouse is on the same coordinates or not.Then I can say, if mouse coordinates changes, start the timer, and if it's bigger than 15, print the text.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Edit:</strong> You can assume it in normal Python without Pygame module, assume you have a function that catching the mouse events, then how to tell Python if coordinates of mouse doesn't change, start the timer, if the time is bigger than 15 seconds,print a text, then refresh the timer.</p>
