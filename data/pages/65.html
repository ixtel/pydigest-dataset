PyDev 3.0 has just been released.</p>
<p>
This is the first version which breaks compatibility with older Eclipse and Java versions, so, in order to run it </p><b>requires Eclipse 3.7 onwards and Java 7</b><p> (for older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x) -- check </p><b>LiClipse</b><p> (</p><a href="http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/">http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/</a><p>), if you want a </p><b>hassle free install</b><p> where things should 'just work'.
</p><p>
This release has 2 main improvements: usability improvements related to configuring an interpreter and several enhancements in the interactive console.
</p><p>
On the </p><b>interpreter configuration</b><p> side, there were several improvements, but I believe the major change is that when the files related to the interpreter are changed in the filesystem (i.e.: when pip-installing a library for instance), PyDev will automatically get that the interpreter configuration needs to be updated (previously a manual step was required in order to add that path to the PyDev interpreter configuration). This was the most voted issue on the tracker and I believe one of the sources of greater frustration for PyDev users -- and it's finally solved! (which for me is the cherry in this release and warrants the newly-acquired 3.0 status!)
</p><p>
As for the </p><b>interactive console</b><p>, it has many noteworthy enhancements (and more enhancements are expected in the upcoming versions):
</p><p>
1. The interactive console can now execute in </p><b>debug mode</b><p>. By enabling this feature in the preferences, it's possible to place breakpoints in code, execute some code in the interactive console and stop at that breakpoint (which is </p><b>really </b><p>nice).
</p><p>
2. </p><b>User Module Deleter</b><p> (UMD): By enabling UMD in the preferences (i.e.: using </p><b>runfile</b> <b>instead of execfile</b><p> to run a python module), dependencies imported when executing some code are reimported (so, changes in files are automatically gotten without requiring manual reload() calls).
</p><p>
3. </p><b>IPython 1.0</b><p> is now supported. Also, </p><b>%edit</b><p> will open the file in the PyDev editor and </p><b>%gui</b><p> customizes the gui event loop integration (i.e.: %gui wx to enable wxPython backend).
</p><p>
More details on the interactive console can be seen at: </p><a href="http://pydev.org/manual_adv_interactive_console.html">http://pydev.org/manual_adv_interactive_console.html</a>
<p>
Other features have also been added, including better handling of numpy arrays in the debugger, right-clicking a variable in the debugger &gt; pretty print to pretty-print it, persistent history in the interactive console -- besides some important fixes.
</p><p>
The last thing is that </p><b>LiClipse</b><p> (</p><a href="http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/">http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/</a><p>) has also been released with the latest changes in PyDev 3.0 and now also supports </p><b>Mako Templates</b><p> and </p><b>Dart </b><p>(besides the languages it already supported, such as Django Templates, Javascript, HTML, C/C++, etc.)
