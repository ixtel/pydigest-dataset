<p>SQLAlchemy release 0.9.7 is now available.</p>
<p>The 0.9 series is now entering maintenance mode where major new features
are now targeted at the 1.0 series.   Release 0.9.7 contains a wide range
of bugfixes, many of which are identified as regressions from previous 0.9.X
releases including three introduced in 0.9.5.   All relevant fixes are of
course forwards-ported to the 1.0 series and a handful are also backported
to 0.8.7, being released at the same time.</p>
<p>A small number of new features include Postgresql JSONB support, improved
Postgresql text matching features and a new event hook which allows database
exceptions to be intercepted and re-thrown as new ones.</p>
<p>Users should carefully review the <a class="reference external" href="/changelog/CHANGES_0_9_7">Changelog</a> to
note which behaviors and issues are affected.   We'd like to thank
the many contributors who helped with this release.</p>
