<p>Framework to build a Telegram Bot based on a UWSGI Server</p>








<div id="a-python-telegram-bot">
<h2>A Python Telegram Bot</h2>
<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/T-Eberle/tgbot" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/T-Eberle/tgbot.svg?branch=master"/></a></p>
<p>Welcome to a UWSGI based abstract Telegram Bot. With this framework you
are easily able to set up a complete Telegram Bot with self made
commands without a lot of extra work. All abstract commands are
implemented as GET-Responses as explained on
<a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api" rel="nofollow">https://core.telegram.org/bots/api</a>. This means you don’t need to have
experience in HTTP Requests or PHP: All you need is python.</p>
<p>In the next few chapters I will explain you all the Features and how to
properly set up the bot.</p>
</div>
<div id="set-up">
<h2>Set Up</h2>
<p>First of all, as we are talking about an <em>abstract</em> bot you first need
to <em>implement</em> this package.</p>
<p><strong>For programming with the bot, you need the following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>At least Python 3.X</li>
<li>A good supported Python IDE (for example PyCharm)</li>
<li>This python package , available on pypi</li>
</ol>
<p>An example implementation of this bot will be soon available in the
example folder.</p>
<p><strong>For using your bot implemenation on a real server</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>At least Python 3.X</li>
<li>Install this package with pip install xxxx</li>
<li>Install regis with pip install redis</li>
<li>Install uwsgi with pip install uwsgi</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Warning</em>: It’s recommended that you install all packages used for your
bot on a virtual environment to not mess up your OS. All infos about
Virtual Environments can be read on
<a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/</a>. With virtual
environments you can keep all the used requirements only for this
project / bot.</p>
<p>More instructions will follow.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<div id="commands-and-inline-commands">
<h3>Commands and Inline Commands</h3>
<p>This Bot support both the normal commands and the newly added inline
commands. To add new commands you simply create methods inside either a
Command- or InlineCommandClass. The name of the method is the command
itself. To add more command- inlinecommandclasses to your bot you simply
add the to the lists which you give the class TGBotWSGI when you
initialise the bot. For more information check the example.</p>
</div>
<div id="configuration">
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>All configurations are managed by *.ini - files.</p>
<p id="uwsgi">
<h4>UWSGI</h4>
</p>
<div id="bot">
<h4>Bot</h4>
<p>For correctly configuring the bot, you need a file
/resources/config/config.ini inside your bot project. All needed
attributes will be explained here in future and will also be shown in
the example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="logging">
<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>The Bot supports a complete logger and can be accessed in
telegram/tglogging/init.py .</p>
</div>
<div id="files">
<h3>Files</h3>
<p>You are able to save several data in .json files. To define new files
you simply define a folder for all your json filesm in the
bot-configuration and define json-file-names in a list when implementing
the class <em>TGBotWSGI</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="redis">
<h3>Redis</h3>
<div id="file-server">
<h4>File Server</h4>
<p>To save performance when e.g. loading files, a cache server is
implemented. Every time a command has been recognized, all the created
files will be loaded into the cache of this server, if the cache is
empty. If it is not empty, every time a command has been recognized the
cache will be used to make the bot more performant.</p>
</div>
<div id="limit-server">
<h4>Limit Server</h4>
<p>To prevent spam there is a limit cache server. In the config.ini you are
able to set the amount and time of a limit: - Amount: How many commands
are allowed until you start to restrict the use of the bot? - Time: What
period are we looking at? When will the restriction be resetted?</p>
</div>
<div id="conversation-server">
<h4>Conversation Server</h4>
<p>Furthermore a conversation cache server has also been added to add
support for longer command conversations. If you , for example, start
with a command, the bot then can answer back with a second question. You
will then answer back etc. All these commands will be explained in the
next sub-chapter.</p>
<p>More Documentation will follow.</p>
