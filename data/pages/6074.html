<p>A Ray-tracing Framework for Science and Engineering</p>








<p>A ray-tracing framework for optical/non-optical physics simulations.</p>
<p>The aims of the Raysect project are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop a ray-tracer that is easy for scientists and engineers to use and extend</li>
<li>the raytracer must be robust and high precision</li>
</ul>
<p>The general development philosophy is ease of use trumps performance, but performance is not to be ignored.</p>
<p>Please note, this code is currently alpha quality and subject to significant change.</p>
<p>Raysect currently only supports Linux. Windows support will come at a later stage.</p>
<p>Please note, for legal reasons we require the copyright to any contributed code to be passed to the Raysect project.</p>
