<p>* <b>Mateusz Opala &amp; Michał Jamroż "Representation learning" (Craftinity: <a href="http://www.craftinity.com">http://www.craftinity.com</a>)</b></p>
<p><span>In the last couple of years there’ve been a lot of buzz generated around performance of deep learning algorithms. DeepMind’s AI plays Atari games, Google’s AI recognizes cats on youtube, smartphones are great at speech recognition, and who knows what we’ll read about tomorrow. </span></p>
<p>  <br/>In the talk we’re going to show you what’s deep learning about using a couple of practical examples. You’ll see that the state-of-the-art of machine learning is not out of reach of a determined pythonista who doesn’t keep away from math.   <br/></p> 
<p><span>  <br/></span></p>
