<html><body><div><dd><p>The line was too long.</p>
<p>Lines greater than <tt><span class="pre">hard-max-line-length</span></tt>
(which is considered the “hard limit”,
and by default is 119 columns)
are never allowed.
Lines greater than <tt><span class="pre">max-line-length</span></tt>
(which is considered the “soft limit”,
and by default is 79 columns)
are allowed if and only if the line contains above a certain percentage of string literals <em>or</em> comments.
The percentages of both are not combined.
The “certain percentage” allowed is <tt><span class="pre">permissive-bulkiness-percentage</span></tt>,
which by default is 67%.</p>
<p>For all of the following examples,
the soft limit is 15 columns,
and the hard limit is 25 columns.</p>
<p>Disallowed because,
at 20 characters,
the line exceeds the soft limit,
and the whole line is only 15% string literals by character count:</p>
<pre>ultradignified = 'y'
</pre>
<p>Allowed because the whole line is 80% string literals by character count:</p>
<pre>t = 'electroplating'
</pre>
<p>Allowed because the whole line is 75% comments by character count:</p>
<pre>f()  # accreditation
</pre>
<p>Disallowed because the whole line is 20% comments and 50% string literals by character count,
and neither of those is at or above 67%:</p>
<pre>d = 'smallpox'  # ok
</pre>
<p>Disallowed because the whole line is 26 characters long,
which exceeds the hard limit:</p>
<pre>thyroparathyroidectomize()
</pre>
<p>The <tt><span class="pre">hard-max-line-length</span></tt> and <tt><span class="pre">permissive-bulkiness-percentage</span></tt> can be configured;
