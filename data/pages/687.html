					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Happy Friday everyone!</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to announce the general availability of the <strong>PyCharm 3.1.2 update</strong> which is hopefully going to be the last release in PyCharm 3.1.x series!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for giving us a lot of helpful feedback and reporting problems to our <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY">public tracker</a>. You helped us a lot so we managed to fix a lot of problems. All fixes are applied to both <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">free and open-source PyCharm Community Edition</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">advanced PyCharm Professional Edition</a> with respect to <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html">supported functionality in these two editions</a>. So as a recap, the most notable fixes in PyCharm 3.1.2 are: Django and JavaScript fixes, Nose test runner fixes, some fixes in code editor and in SQL support. Some problems with code navigation and in debugger for Python 3.4 are fixed as well. We also included a lot of performance enhancements into this release. For Mac users: we turned off native Mac message boxes by default to avoid UI locks. You can always turn them back on by setting ide.mac.message.dialogs.as.sheets=true in the idea.properties configuration file.</p>
