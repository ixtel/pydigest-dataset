					<p>Hey there, so I’ve been thinking about your second question. It’s a big question <img src="http://krondo.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/> It basically turns into the question “how should you write software”, since most really useful programs end up getting fairly complicated.</p>
<p>I don’t have a real answer to your question, even though I’ve written a lot of software, some of it ending up kind of big. To me there is a legitimate viewpoint that interprets most of the major innovations in software (functions, modules, classes, types, etc.) as different ways<br/>
to answer this question, basically different strategies for dealing with complexity.</p>
<p>But here are some general rules of thumb that I think most programmers would agree with:</p>
<p> + Build your software out of small components and make the interfaces to those components as small as possible.</p>
<p> + Try to keep the dependencies of any one component small in number.</p>
<p>Following this strategy will make it easier to test your components and to change them over time.</p>
<p>Although it is more controversial, I also think there is some value in the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection" rel="nofollow">Dependency Injection</a>, a pattern where components declare their dependencies rather than explicitly create them. Then, during runtime, the dependencies are ‘injected’ by the context, usually some sort of configuration system. This also makes it very easy to, say, substitute a mock component during testing.</p>
<p>The situation you are describing where you have on big object that all the others depend on is a common one that people end up with, I think. And whether it is good enough for your projects depends on your situation. For smallish programs, I think you can get away with that, as long as you keep that top-level object very simple (basically it’s just a container of other things without methods of its own and acts kind of like a dependency injection configuration).</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck on your project, if you haven’t already finished <img src="http://krondo.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"/></p>
