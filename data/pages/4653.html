Today, for a change, a different kind of Python post, but one that I think will be interesting to my readers:
</p><p>
From the horse's, er, snake's mouth :)

</p><a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/home/about">Talk Python to Me</a><p> "is a </p><b>weekly podcast</b><p> hosted by </p><a href="http://blog.michaelckennedy.net/">Michael Kennedy</a><p>. The show covers a </p><b>wide array of Python topics</b><p> as well as many related topics (e.g. MongoDB, AngularJS, DevOps)."
</p><p>
The format is a casual </p><b>30 minute conversation with industry expert</b><p>s.
</p><p>
I just came across it today, and am checking out the site a bit. The site itself looks good, visually, I mean.
</p><p>
Some of the podcasts also have text transcripts.
</p><p>
I'm reading one of the transcripts, Transcript for Episode #8, of the conversation with Dr. James Curran:

</p><a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/transcript/8/teaching-python-at-grok-learning-and-classrooms">Teaching Python at Grok Learning and Classrooms</a>
<p>
Excerpt:
</p><p>
"</p><b>James Curran</b><p> is an </p><b>associate professor</b><p> in </p><b>computer science</b><p> at the </p><b>University of Sidney</b><p> and </p><b>co-founder of Grok Learning</b><p>, which you can find at </p><b>groklearning.com</b><p>. James has been teaching computer science to students and teachers for over a decade. In 2010 he was named </p><b>one of Sidney magazines top 100 influential people</b><p> for his work in </p><b>computer science education</b><p>."
</p><p>
(I guess the 'Sidney' spelling is due to an error in the automated or manual transcription of the podcast.)
</p><p>
Anyway, the transcript is interesting, since is about Python and/in education / training, which are both </p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.com/search/label/python">among</a><p> my </p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.in/p/about-vasudev-ram.html">interests</a><p>.
</p><p>
An interesting point mentioned in the talk, is that </p><b>Australia</b><p> is </p><b>mandating text-based computer programming</b><p> in its schools, as opposed to only having visual programming with tools like Scratch. Methinks that is a good idea, since only being able to work with GUI's and no skill with text-based tools (such as text editors and the command line), is not a good thing, IMO. I've come across, and once interviewed (for a client), some Java "programmers" who could not write a simple Java program without reaching for Eclipse. What the hell. Not knocking Java. I'm sure there must be people like that for other languages too. [ Dons latest flame shield made of modern composites in advance ... :) ]
</p><p>
Dr. Curran on the topic:
</p><p>
"So we have done a lot of work with teaching students in seventh and eighth grade, and I think that that is the ideal zone in fact the Australian curriculum that I was just involved in writing has mandated that the kids will learn a text based programming language as opposed to something like visual language, like Scratch. So text based programming is mandated for year seventh and eighth, and Python I think is the ideal language to be teaching there."
