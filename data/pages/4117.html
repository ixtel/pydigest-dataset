  <p><em><a href="/sweiqotd/">Software Engineering Interview Question of the Day</a> is an ongoing (semi-) daily series in which I explore the answer to a question that is like the questions one is asked in a software engineering interview. This is mostly for my own benefit, but may benefit you, as well, so I decided to share.</em></p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Given a set of strings, return the smallest subset that contains prefixes for every string. (<a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Given-a-set-of-strings-return-the-smallest-subset-that-contains-prefixes-for-every-string-If-the-list-is-foo-foog-QTN_870450.htm">source</a>)</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>

<p>Some problems just cry out for a particular approach, and this is one of them. Whenever you hear the word "prefix" you should probably start thinking "trie," and this problem is no exception. <a href="/algods/2015/04/13/dive-into-tries/">I talked quite a lot about tries yesterday</a>, and this post is going to build on top of that one, so please head over there first if you don't know what tries are.</p>

<p>If you remember from last time, finding the strings encoded in a trie that possess a common prefix involves finding the node for the last character in the prefix, and then doing a depth-first search from that node to every leaf on the trie. Here we want to do something similar, but instead of searching for <em>every</em> leaf, we want to find the <em>first</em> leaf, which will represent the shortest word.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

<p>Knowing the right data structure to use turns a difficult problem into a simple one. If for nothing else you should brush up on your <a href="/algods/">algorithms and data structures</a>.</p>
