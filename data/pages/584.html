<p>It looks like about 2,000 requests / hour is all uwsgi can handle before it starts to throw errors. That is only about 1 request every two seconds so that is a pretty big problem.</p>
<p>We needed to handle 10,000 requests / hour, but we were only able to handle 2,000 requests / hour. So it looks like we would need roughly 5x the capacity to handle a spike of this size. This is a little bit misleading though because many visitors abandoned the site after hitting 50X errors and long page loads.</p>
<p>Here is a view of the same traffic spike from Google Analytics.</p>
<p><img src="data/google-analytics.png" alt="Google Analytics Pageviews vs. Pages per Visit"/></p>
<p>During the spike, pages per visit were roughly half of what they normally were, so let's double the 5x estimate and plan for 10x the capacity to handle this load.</p>
