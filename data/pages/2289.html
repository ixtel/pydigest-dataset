<p>First of all, it's not about Django, but about Django REST Framework, which is a separate project from, but works as an add-on to, Django Framework. Those are two different entities. Django has just hit 1.7 version mark, so confusing those two is a sign of poor research.</p>
<p>Have Tom Christie noted that for you directly, have you asked him for comments? Did he held a press conference perhaps? API incompatibility changes are quite common for major version bumps. Release warning is important, but making a story like this is just silly. </p>
<p>I suspect that third paragraph was created by removing random words from IW article, which already removed some from release notes, and shuffling the rest. Every time I read this paragraph, it just doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>And the final one, oh gosh. Those are release notes for 3.0 version. They have like 10 screens of important changes for THIS version. You haven't mention none of them, just took last, least important part (which will be elaborated in next releases) and made a story of it, which has no point and no sense. This is not a local evening news.</p>
<p>Please, be serious. Don't do this, don't turn this site into Bloomberg's press release section with bulls*it bingo phrases.</p></div></div></body></html>
