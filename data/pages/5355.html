            <p>I'm a third-year graduate student at the Institute
        for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii working with <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/FACULTY/GAIDOS/pebl.html">
        Eric Gaidos</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/danxhuber/">Dan Huber</a>
        on finding and characterizing giant planets orbiting giant
        stars. I'm also working with <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/stuartj/default/stuartj.shtml">
        Stuart
        Jefferies</a> on understanding the subsurface structure of the
        Sun. Previously, I worked with <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/howard/Home.html">Andrew
        Howard</a> on a new statistical method to describe stellar noise in
        exoplanet mass measurements. Check out <a href="https://eos.org/articles/new-step-toward-finding-earth-2-0">this</a> news article to
        learn more.</p>

	I'm interested in better understanding the relationship
        between planets and their host stars in
        the context of planet formation and evolution, and the search for
        extraterrestrial life. In my free time, I enjoy making music,
	attempting to surf, and teaching scientific
        programming skills in Python.</p>
