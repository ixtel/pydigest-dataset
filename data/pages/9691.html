<p>Is there a way to show the errors that occurred on the server during a StaticLiveServerTestCase directly in the test feedback? That being, when some server function call errors and page just doesn't show up, the test execution by default has no knowledge of the server error. Is there someway to pass that output onto the testing thread?</p>

<p>Preferably the these errors would show up in the same place that errors directly in the test code execution show up. If this isn't (easily) possible though, what's the next best way to quickly see those server errors?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Code (as requested):</strong></p>

<pre><code>class TestFunctionalVisitor(StaticLiveServerTestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.browser = webdriver.Firefox()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.browser.quit()

    def test_visitor(self):
        self.browser.get(self.live_server_url)
        self.assertEqual(self.browser.title, "Something")

...

class Home(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'home.html'

    def get_context_data(self):
        context = {}
        MyModel = None
        context['my_models'] = MyModel.objects.all()
        return context
</code></pre>

<p>This has been significantly altered to make it simple and short. But when <code>MyModel</code> is <code>None</code> and tries to call <code>objects.all()</code> the server has a server 500 error, but all I get is the <code>"Something" not in self.browser.title</code> error from the test output, when I'd like to see the <code>NoneType has no...</code> error in the test output.</p>
