<p>Practical Python for Astronomers is a series of hands-on workshops to explore
the Python language and the powerful analysis tools it provides. <em>The emphasis
is on using Python to solve real-world problems that astronomers are likely to
encounter in research.</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The workshops immediately make use of the full suite of plotting,
analysis, and file reading tools.</li>
<li>Along the way elements of the Python language such as data types, control structures,
functions, and objects are introduced.</li>
<li>This is an interactive experience using tutorial examples run by participants on their laptops.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workshop topics</strong></p>

<p><strong>Archival topic</strong></p>
<p>The following topic is based on packages that are not being actively
developed and have been superceded.  However there are still useful concepts
presented here and we keep it for reference.</p>

<h2>Sample Workshop Schedule</h2>
<p>The workshop schedule is as follows.  Except for the first introductory session all
workshops are hands-on and participants should bring a laptop.</p>

<h2>About the Workshops</h2>
<p>The content presented here is suitable for self-study by those wishing to learn
Python for astronomy or other scientific research applications.</p>
<p><strong>A greater goal is for those knowledgable in Python to teach the workshop
series at their local institutions, adapting the content as desired.</strong> To that
end we have developed the content in <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org">Sphinx</a>
RestructuredText and hosted the source on github at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/python4astronomers/">https://github.com/python4astronomers/</a>.  Anyone interested can clone the
repository or download a tarball and make modifications needed to present the
material locally.</p>
<p>We would also welcome comments, fixes, or suggestions for improvement.  This
can be done as a Github issue or pull request, or by sending email to
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:aldcroft%40head.cfa.harvard.edu">aldcroft<span>@</span>head<span>.</span>cfa<span>.</span>harvard<span>.</span>edu</a>.</p>
<p>The workshop material here was presented in the Spring of 2011 at the Harvard /
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  A range of about 25 to 50 people
participated in the different workshops, which were 1.5 hours in duration.
Based on our experience a 2 hour slot would have been more reasonable to allow
time for the exercises and discussion.</p>

<div class="section" id="about-the-format">
<h2>About the Format</h2>
<p>The workshop presentations are formatted as Sphinx web documents instead of the
more traditional slide presentation.  This was a natural choice for the
authors who all use <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org">Sphinx</a> for Python documenation.  Further inspiration was
drawn from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sal.ksu.edu/faculty/tim/prof-day/index.html">Dumping PowerPoint in Favor of Web Sites</a>.  This site
highlights by discussion and examples the advantages in using a web-based study
guide.  In particular we found the non-linear format (e.g. jumping to different
sections or web sites) and ability to show longer examples were quite valuable.</p>
<p>Having full prose text results in a document which is far more useful as a
standalone study guide than presentation slides.  Ironically it also reduces
the temptation to read from the screen.</p>
