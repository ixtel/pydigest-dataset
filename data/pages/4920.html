        <p><a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">PEP257</a> is a Python Enhancement Proposal that centers around docstring conventions.</p>

<p>If you’ve been using Python for a while, you must have heard about PEP8. PEP8
is a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) that lays down conventions for how
Python code should look like. There’s also a pep8.py project that enforces the
PEP8 conventions by reading Python source files and outputting a list of errors
in your code. Well, PEP257 is a lesser known PEP that centers around docstring
coventions.</p>

<p>Since last November, I’ve been the maintainer of <code>pep257.py</code> – a script that
enforces these docstring conventions in the same way that pep8.py enforces
regular coding conventions. <code>pep257.py</code> was authored by <a href="https://github.com/keleshev">Vladimir Keleshev</a>, who
was kind enough to give me the reins for the project.</p>

<p>On June 1st, I gave a lightning talk about PEP257 at a local Tel-Aviv meetup
called PyWeb-IL. It’s a once-a-month meetup about everything related to Python,
web development, and more.</p>
