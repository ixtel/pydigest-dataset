					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Today we published the <strong>PyCharm 3.1 EAP build #133.673</strong>. <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+%28EAP%29">Download</a> it from the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+%28EAP%29">PyCharm’s Early Access Preview (EAP) page</a>. Hopefully this is the last EAP build before the final preview build – the PyCharm 3.1 Release Candidate!</p>
<p>The PyCharm 3.1 release itself is going to be out soon depending on your feedback. So please help us make the release faster and better – and if any problems arise, please file an issue to our <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY">public issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p><strong>So, what’s new?</strong> While the <strong>PyCharm 3.1 EAP build #133.673</strong> is primarily consists of bug-fixes, among those most notable are fixes related to <em>type inference, test runner and python formatter</em> (the full list of changes is available <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/PyCharm+133.673+Release+Notes">here</a>), we sneaked in a few performance optimizations as well:</p>
<p>1. Now PyCharm <strong>works better when resolving into heavy binary modules</strong> like PyGTK and PyQT, thanks to a new binary modules skeletons generation process. Previously all binary module auxiliary data was preserved in a single file. Now PyCharm splits data across smaller chunks, thus making code completion and other code insight features to work a bit faster.</p>
<p>2. We’ve <strong>fixed performance problems with editing large *.po files</strong>. Hopefully, now everything should work just fine.</p>
<p>For the complete list of changes in this build, please see the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/PyCharm+133.673+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>A patch update will be available from within the IDE soon in case you are updating from the EAP update channel. For those who want this build asap, please <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+%28EAP%29">download</a> the full installation source from the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+%28EAP%29">EAP page</a>.</p>
