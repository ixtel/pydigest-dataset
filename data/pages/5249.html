<p>Following on from 2014's inspirational keynote
advocating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVv7fCwVbp4">Python
for Every Child in Australia</a> as part of the rollout of the
Australian Digital Curriculum, this year sees PyCon Australia playing
host to its first
ever <a href="http://2015.pycon-au.org/media/news/35"> Python in
Education</a> miniconf. As part of that event, we are thrilled to
announce our second PyCon Australia 2015 keynote speaker: Carrie Anne
Philbin, Education Pioneer at
the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/"> Raspberry Pi
Foundation</a>, chair of the UK's <a href="http://casinclude.org.uk/">Computing at School's #include</a>
initiative, author
of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/carrie-anne-philbins-adventures-in-raspberry-pi">
"Adventures in Raspberry Pi"</a>, and a member of the Board of
Directors for the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/mission/">Python Software Foundation</a>.</p>
<p/>
<p>As an award winning secondary Computing &amp;
ICT teacher, Carrie Anne is a vocal advocate for the merits of
Python as an educational tool, and brings to PyCon Australia a
wealth of experience with the UK's search for a suitable text
based programming language to serve as a follow on from
self-contained visual programming environments like
Scratch.</p>

<p>However, while Python is already a good tool
for educational use, it's far from perfect. During the main
conference, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python
becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer
science, and some of the possible ways those barriers could be
lowered through improved tooling and further support from the
Python developer community.</p>

<p>In addition to her keynote presentation, as
part of the Python in Education miniconf, Carrie Anne will be
reviewing the Raspberry Pi Foundation's experiences in
creating and delivering the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/picademy/">
Picademy</a> continuing professional development
workshops for teachers in the UK, as well as facilitating small
group “birds of a feather” sessions where teachers and
interested developers can explore ways to collaborate
more effectively on both formal and informal educational
efforts.</p>

<p>Carrie Anne has a blended and open approach to
teaching as can be seen by her website <a href="http://www.ictwithmissp.co.uk">ICT with Miss P</a> that students use to access their weekly lessons. She uses innovative web tools to help support and extend the learning in her 21st century classroom which resulted in
becoming a <a href="http://skypemoments.com/moment-makers/">Skype Moment Maker</a> and ambassador for technology in
2014. Carrie Anne often speaks at conferences
  like <a href="http://www.bettshow.com/SeminarDetail.aspx?Semid=Reg14">BETT</a>,
  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG3r_-anf1w&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UU_IWRSNY-l5yKrn7fI9e0Kw">Raspberry Jamboree</a>, YRS and
  <a href="http://www.pyconuk.org/">PyconUK</a>, and is the creator of a YouTube video series for teenage girls called
  <a href="http://www.geekgurldiaries.co.uk">The Geek Gurl Diaries</a>, which has won a Talk Talk
Digital Hero Award. The episodes include interviews with women
working in technology and hands on computer science based
tutorials.</p>
<p>It's genuinely exciting to offer such
a practical follow-up to 2014's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVv7fCwVbp4">Python for Every
Child in Australia</a> as we help forge stronger
connections between Australia's open source and educational
communities.</p>
