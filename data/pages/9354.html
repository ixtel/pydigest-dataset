                    <p>After thirty four days of hard work, <a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com">Audrey Roy</a> and I are proud to announce that we've released the <strong>beta</strong> of <a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org">Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5</a>. It's been a monumental effort, a labor of love, and we hope you find our efforts worthy. You can buy it right now in e-book (PDF) form on the website: <a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org">http://django.2scoops.org</a></p>
<p>Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5 is a compilation of best practices for the Django framework. Like any framework, Django has tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't documented in one place. Experienced developers know this stuff, but gleaning it off the Internet takes a lot of time. We decided to take everything we know and write it down.</p>
<p>We stand of the shoulders of giants: We received advice from Django experts including a BDFL, Django core developers, and subject matter experts from around the world. Reader contributions from advanced and beginning developers have also shaped the book, and we can't thank enough those who gave us their insights.</p>

<h2>What is different about the beta release?</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added 50+ pages of content while reducing the file size from 5.1 MB to 1.5 MB.</li>
<li>Added list of tables, list of figures, and an index.</li>
<li>Dramatically improved the chapters on security, testing, logging, admin, and many more.</li>
<li>Added so many more code samples that even with the new example numbering system we lost count.</li>
<li>Speaking of code examples, most of the code samples in the book are loaded directly out of fully tested projects.</li>
<li>Incorporated the feedback of dozens of readers. Thank you so much for your contributions!</li>

<h2>What does buying the beta get me?</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Access the PDF version of the book.</li>
<li>Access to the Kindle and ePub formats when we release the final.</li>
<li>Access to final release of the book.</li>
</ul>
<a name="alternative-formats"/></div>
<div class="section" id="why-aren-t-there-kindle-or-epub-versions-yet">
<h2>Why aren't there Kindle or ePub versions yet?</h2>
<p>We want to support more formats, but won't do it poorly. It's going to take us at least several days to render the book in an alternative format that looks good. Since we both have multiple presentations at the upcoming <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US</a>, we simply don't have time to get it done.</p>

<div class="section" id="if-i-bought-the-alpha-do-i-have-to-buy-the-beta">
<h2>If I bought the alpha do I have to buy the beta?</h2>
<p>Alpha buyers get full access the beta. In fact, you should have already received an email with a link to the latest version. If that hasn't arrived, please email us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com">2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a>.</p>
<a name="beginners"/></div>
<div class="section" id="is-this-book-good-for-beginners">
<h2>Is this book good for beginners?</h2>
<p>The response from beginning Django developers reading it has been <strong>unbelievably, overwhelmingly positive</strong>. This is the book we wanted to have when we learned Django, and we're honored by the response the book has received.</p>
<p>Since the book isn't a tutorial, we ask that before beginners purchase it, they <a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">learn the fundamentals of</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914/?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ihpydanny-20">Python</a> and take the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/">official Django tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>When beginners find sections of the book above their head, they do what everyone does when reading a technical reference: skip over challenging sections until they have enough grounding to understand.</p>
<p>If any beginners are confused by our explanations, or have difficulties, please email us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com">2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a>. We'll do our best to answer your questions. Your issues provide invaluable insight into what we need to improve.</p>

<h2>Is this book good for experienced developers?</h2>
<p>We've done our best to provide worthwhile material for developers of all levels. In fact, a lot of intermediate to advanced developers have said they've found good things to use in our book. Many have also found that by using our book as a supplementary manual, it helps them their team work better.</p>
<a name="updates"/></div>
<div class="section" id="is-this-book-going-to-get-updated">
<h2>Is this book going to get updated?</h2>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>During the <strong>alpha</strong> we updated the book multiple times before knuckling down on the <strong>beta</strong> rewrite. Even after the final version comes out, we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of self-published e-books is we have total control of content.</p>
<a name="print"/></div>
<div class="section" id="when-can-i-get-a-print-version">
<h2>When can I get a print version?</h2>
<p>After a lot of consideration, we've decided to hold off on the print version of the book until what we call the <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/two-scoops-beta-released.html#final">final</a> release, which won't be released until after <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US</a>. We're very finicky and don't want buyers of the print version to have an unfinished book.</p>

<div class="section" id="when-is-the-book-s-final-release">
<h2>When is the book's final release?</h2>
<p>The final release won't occur until after PyCon.</p>
<p>Our plan for the final release of Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5 is to focus on errata, alternative electronic formats, and the print version.</p>
<a name="bulk"/></div>
<div class="section" id="can-we-purchase-the-book-in-bulk">
<h2>Can we purchase the book in bulk?</h2>
<p>We're working on a program to provide organizations the capability to purchase many e-copies and keep the recipients of the book updated constantly. We hope to have this ready in a few days.</p>

<div class="section" id="can-i-buy-the-book-via-paypal">
<h2>Can I buy the book via PayPal?</h2>
<p>No. I've answered in full <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/we-are-not-using-paypal.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We're considering other non-credit card options to handle payment.</p>

<h2>Known Issue Warnings</h2>
<div class="section" id="copy-paste">
<h3>Copy/Paste</h3>
<p>There are problems with copy/pasting of code from the PDF. The new build process is turning the code examples into some sort of image type of object, which explains the strange characters. We're working on it, but aren't sure how long the fix will take.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="android">
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>On Android, if you try to open the PDF directly from the Gumroad download, you might get a "Cannot open file" error; however, if you navigate to the download location on your phone/tablet with a file browser (e.g. Samsung's "My Files"), you should be able to open the file from there. Gumroad is currently investigating the issue.</p>
<a name="errata"/></div>

<div class="section" id="where-should-i-send-errata-or-suggestions">
<h2>Where should I send errata or suggestions?</h2>
<p>Please send errata to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops@cartwheelweb.com">2scoops@cartwheelweb.com</a>. We try to respond personally to every request.</p>
