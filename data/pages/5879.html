<p>Tools for interacting with Intel's AMT</p><p>








===============================</p><p>Python AMT Tools</p><p>===============================</p><p>.. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/sdague/amt.svg</p><p>        :target: https://travis-ci.org/sdague/amt</p><p>.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/amt.svg</p><p>        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/amt</p><p>Tools for interacting with Intel's Active Management Technology</p><p>Background</p><p>----------</p><p>AMT is a light weight hardware control interface put into some Intel</p><p>based laptops and desktops as a tool for corporate fleets to manage</p><p>hardware. It provides the basics of power control, as well as remote</p><p>console via VNC. It functions by having a dedicated service processor</p><p>sniff traffic off the network card on specific ports before it gets to</p><p>the operating system. Some versions of Intel NUC boxes have AMT, which</p><p>make them ideal candidates for building a reasonable cluster in your</p><p>basement.</p><p>There was once a tool called ``amttool`` which let you interact with</p><p>these systems from Linux. This used the SOAP interface to AMT. That</p><p>was removed in v9 of the firmware, which means it no longer works with</p><p>modern AMT in the field.</p><p>The interface that remains is CIM, a standard from the DMTF that</p><p>builds XML models for all the things. There exist very few examples</p><p>for how to make this work on the internet, with one exception: the</p><p>OpenStack Baremetal (Ironic) service. It has native support for AMT</p><p>hardware control.</p><p>This project is derivative work from Ironic. The heavy lifting of</p><p>understanding all the CIM magic incantations, and oh the magic they</p><p>are, comes from that code. Refactored for a more minimal usage.</p><p>Hardware that includes AMT</p><p>--------------------------</p><p>AMT is branded as vPro in products by Intel. It is found in many Intel</p><p>based laptops. There are also specific models of Intel NUC that</p><p>include vPro.</p><p>* `Intel NUC KIT Core Processor BLKNUC5I5MYHE &lt;http: amzn.to="" 1ozshhf=""&gt;`_</p><p>This code gets tested with ``5i5MYHE`` NUCs as well as an older NUC</p><p>that I have laying around.</p><p>Configuring AMT</p><p>---------------</p><p>AMT must be enabled in the BIOS before it can be used externally. This</p><p>is done by pressing ``Ctrl-P`` during initial boot. Initial user /</p><p>pass is ``admin`` / ``admin``. You will be required to create a new</p><p>admin password that has at least 1: number, capital letter, and non</p><p>alphanumeric symbol.</p><p>One you do that, reboot and you are on your way.</p><p>amtctrl</p><p>-------</p><p>The ``amt`` library installs a binary ``amtctrl`` for working with AMT</p><p>enabled machines.</p><p>machine enrollment</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>To simplify the control commands ``amtcrtl`` has a machine</p><p>registry. New machines are added via:</p><p>    amtctrl add &lt;name&gt; &lt;address&gt; &lt;amtpassword&gt;</p><p>You can see a list of all machines with:</p><p>   amtctrl list</p><p>And remove an existing machine with:</p><p>   amtctrl rm &lt;name&gt;</p><p>controlling machines</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>Once machines are controlled you have a number of options exposed:</p><p>   amtctrl &lt;name&gt; &lt;command&gt;</p><p>Command is one of:</p><p>* on - power on the machine</p><p>* off - power off the machine</p><p>* reboot - power cycle the machine</p><p>* pxeboot - set the machine to pxeboot the next time it reboots, and</p><p>  reboot the machine. This is extremely useful if you have install</p><p>  automation on pxeboot.</p><p>* status - return power status as an ugly CIM blob (TODO: make this better)</p><p>Futures</p><p>-------</p><p>* More extensive in tree testing (there currently is very little of</p><p>  this)</p><p>* Retry http requests when they fail. AMT processors randomly drop</p><p>some connections, built in limited retry should be done.</p><p>* Fault handling. The current code is *very* optimistic. Hence, the</p><p>  0.x nature.</p><p>* Remove console control. There are AMT commands to expose a VNC</p><p>  remote console on the box. Want to support those.</p><p>History</p><p>-------</p><p>0.3.0 (2015-10-08)</p><p>------------------</p><p>* python 3 print fix (thanks Mike Nawrocki)</p><p>* add set_next_boot and change_boot_order_request (thanks John L. Villalovos)</p><p>0.1.0 (2015-08-09)</p><p>---------------------</p><p>* First release on PyPI.
