    <div class="container without-background" id="faq">
        <div class="row"><div class="col-md-4">
<p><b>Do I need to know anything about websites or programming?</b></p>
<p>No! Workshops are for beginners. You don’t need to know anything about it.  However, if you have a little bit of technical knowledge (i.e. you know what HTML or CSS is) you still can apply!</p>

</div><div class="col-md-4"><p><b>I do not live in Colorado. Can I still attend?</b></p>
<p>Of course! Workshops will be in English, so if you have no trouble with speaking and understanding English, you should apply.  </p></div>

<div class="col-md-4"><p><b>Should I bring my own laptop?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We have no hardware, so we expect you to bring your computer with you.  It is also important for us that you will take home everything you’ll write and create during workshops. </p></div></div>

<div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><p><b>Do I need to have something installed on my laptop? </b></p>
<p>It would be helpful to have Django installed before workshops, but we don't expect you to install anything on your own.  We will make sure that one of our coaches will help you with this task. </p></div>

<div class="col-md-4"><p><b>Is food provided? </b></p><p>Yes. Thanks to <a href="http://www.fusionbox.com" target="_blank">Fusionbox</a>, snacks and lunch will be served during workshops. </p></div>
