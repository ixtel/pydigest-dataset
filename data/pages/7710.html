<p>Now, it is certainly the case that there could be more than one 36-year-old male who rides 6.8 miles at the same time each day, but this strikes me as very unlikely.
When we find such a distinct, consistent pattern of use, we can be fairly confident that we have identified the rides of an individual person.</p>
<p>With this in mind, how many other individuals might we find?
Doing this via a manual search would be a long and painful process: with over 50 stations, there are over 1200 unique station pairs and any number of riders of various ages and genders.
So instead of combing through the data by hand, we can use another unsupervised algorithm to do the search automatically.
We are again looking for clusters, but want an algorithm that is sensitive to overdensities within a noisy background: an algorithm known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift">Mean-Shift Clustering</a> is a good candidate for this.</p>
<p>After running the clustering model on the trips between each pair of stations, we will define a metric that measures how well we have localized an individual rider, rank the station pairs by this metric, and then only visually examine the dozen or so with the highest rankings.
Once this ranking is computed, we find that the top match is the 36-year-old male we identified above!</p>
<p>To learn a bit more, let's look at when his rides occurred over the course of the year, and how his ride times changed as time went on:</p>
