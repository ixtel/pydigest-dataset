<p>I have some question
In a project I have the need of work with users which are of three (may be more) types of them have different roles:
physician
patient
administrator</p>

<p>I have been thinking use of the Django Model Users and extend it creating a userprofile model ...
But I ignore how to manage the different roles because, the userprofile model will have fields of the user model, althought I don't know how to address the roles topic.</p>

<p>1 User have Many userprofiles may be? I don't know</p>

<p>Or may be I will should create a Roles Model/Table in where I specify the roles types and create a relation with the Users Model. This is a good possibility.</p>

<p>Another possibility (as a comment more below) is check the Django permissions system, in which I can create user groups, and assign permissions to these groups, althought here I can only edit, create and delete models really?</p>

<p>I am a few confuse about of how to address this subject</p>

<p>Searching I found this app.

<p>If somebody can orient me about it, I will be much grateful
Best Regards</p>
