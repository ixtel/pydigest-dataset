																						<p>Python is among one of the most popular and code-efficient languages available in the modern IT world. One of the primary reasons is that it has several features that are not available in any single language and it rather motivates programmers to write a readable code. As a language, Python has some powerful constructs for high-speed development and with its large standard library at the disposal, it becomes fairly easy to write new tools. Programmers working with other languages find Python comparatively easier to follow and understand.</p>
<p>If you are working into development, it makes perfect sense to work with a web framework because it can help you jump-start your web application. It allows you to create a simple design with individual components for easy development.</p>

<p>Flask is a micro-framework because of its extensible yet simple core. A new programmer might find it lacking several features such as form validation, database abstraction layer, and use of third-party libraries for adding common features. However, it allows extensions that make it comparatively easier to add the required functionality. Some of its features are perfect for development such as unit testing and it allows secure cookies for client-side applications. It is suited for light-weight applications and projects.</p>

<p>One of the most important reasons behind the origin of CherryPy is its compatibility with Python and its pythonic interface allows developers to integrate it just like any other module available in python. Another excellent feature is the ability to customize its every function and it comes with a native adapter (mod_python) making it excellent for development. It offers support for every single WSGI-enabled adapter and it allows wide implementation of CherryPy.</p>

<p>Pyramid is known for its efficient and fast-pace development abilities. One of the best things about this framework is the inclusion of some of the most exclusive features available in Python, Perl, and Ruby. This open source web framework has platform independent MVC structure and a minimalistic approach in development. Further, it is among the first platforms to reuse code at such a massive scale making development efficient.</p>

<p>It is a unique framework in itself primarily because of its simplicity and the powerful development ability. You can comfortably write web apps in python; hence, taking the liability out of frameworks. Programmers enjoy working on web.py because of its zero limitations and ease of use. Some programmers might find its fewer features limiting; however, it allows room for successful integration and you don’t have to carry on all of these features, especially when you don’t need them.</p>

<p>It was motivated by the Zope toolkit and it started as an easy extension of zope toolkit making it easier for rookie programmers to use it. If you are starting into web applications, Grok can offer multiple building blocks and it has an excellent community, which is always ready to support. It offers a much simpler but rather agile mode of learning Python. It comes with a DRY approach making it an excellent tool with convention over configuration structure.</p>

<p>Flexibility is one of the key features of pylons framework. Its central idea is to combine some of the best features offered by different Python frameworks and combine them together at a single place. Pyramid was one of the first offerings of Pylons and it laid emphasis over speedy and flexible development practices. You can literally use and combine any feature of your choice making web development efficient.</p>

<p>It can be called as the conclusive framework with the features of its predecessors and none of the limitations experienced by other Python frameworks. It is possible to extend it into a full-stock solution and it even suits simple micro framework projects in a similar manner. It never feels like as if you are working on a framework and rather feels like writing new functions. You can create a read-to-extend application within a few minutes and it has a huge tutorial collection over the internet.</p>

<p>The most important factors of web2py are its zero external dependencies and the ability to create, alter, manage, and modify your application within the browser only. You don’t have to work over simple web development tasks and most of these are automated for quicker development. The programmer doesn’t even require a single package for development, debugging, testing, deployment, and even database handling purposes. You can do it all with built-in web interface and it doesn’t has to be installed prior to usage. The programmer can initial a global environment with every http request and it is nothing like the other modules available in its parent frameworks.</p>

<p>Zope is a complete family of different web frameworks and it was pretty much the only framework that promoted Python as a programming language. With the development of other frameworks, zope2 is rather limited to the content management systems in our current development environment. The Zope tool kit is an excellent resource of libraries that allows you to reuse code and different libraries for efficient programming.</p>

<p>The most important pillar of CubicWeb is code reusability and it comprises of code units in the form of cubes. It is highly flexible and yet powerful with some extraordinary features including RQL query language or a semantic-view feature for efficient coding. It is the best solution for semantic web applications and offers the ideal environment.</p>
