				<h3>Is this a hosted service?</h3>
				<p>No. Sendy is a self hosted application that runs on your web server. Pay once and it's yours, there's no recurring fee.</p>
				<h3>What are the requirements?</h3>
				<p>You need an Apache server running a Unix like operating system (eg. Linux) with PHP &amp; MySQL support. Almost all hosting companies support them.</p>
				<h3>Is Sendy easy to setup?</h3>
				<p>Yes. Just follow our <a href="get-started" title="">Get Started Guide</a> to get up and running.</p>
				<h3>Will you update Sendy?</h3>
				<p>Yes of course! We're using Sendy as well and will continually make it better and better. <a href="get-updated" title="">Updates</a> are free up till the next major version, eg. version 3.x, 4.x etc.</p>
				<h3>What's SES send rate and limit?</h3>
				<p>Once signed up for Amazon SES, submit the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/extendedaccessrequest" target="_blank">SES Sending Limits form</a> to request for your desired daily sending limit. Eg. if you need to send 10k emails daily, request Amazon for a daily sending limit of 10k emails per day.</p>

				<h3>Can I install Sendy on multiple domains?</h3>
				<p>Sendy can be installed on one domain per license. To install Sendy on more domains, you need additional licenses. Sendy's licensed domain is just 'where you install Sendy on'. You can send emails belonging to any domain you want.</p>
				<h3>Are Sendy's files obfuscated?</h3>
				<p>Sendy's files are not obfuscated except for the installation and functions file. You can edit the source code for your own personal use without needing these two files.</p>
				<h3>What's with Sendy's low pricing?</h3>
				<p>Some say the cheapest option isn't always the best value. What they may have failed to understand is that Sendy is an app that you host yourself and that it uses Amazon's sophisticated email infrastructure built over the years to serve its own large-scale customer base. Brands like <a href="http://www.comcast.com/" target="_blank">Comcast</a>, <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/" target="_blank">Consumer Reports</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.instra.com/" title="">Instra</a> understood this and have started adopting Sendy.</p>
