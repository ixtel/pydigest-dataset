I'm excited about it because I've attended Matt's tutorials and came away feeling leveled up on my Python chops. </p><p>Nearly 5 years ago I was getting started in Python and learning on my own by writing small scripts to automate silly stuff. I wasn't writing anything adventurous and I was looking for a way to improve my skills.</p><p>Right around that time I started getting involved in the open source community in Utah and decided to go to a local conference. Matt was doing a 3 hour tutorial that covered beginner to intermediate Python. When the session was over I felt empowered. I couldn't wait to get back home to do the exercises that he had laid out during the training. After working through them I felt like I really knew the language. I was writing generators and decorators by the end of it. It was an accelerated learning experience that took me from a novice to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman">journeyman</a>. </p><p>The beauty of his training is, it wasn't merely a brain dump, he was teaching me to how to learn, where to look up the docs, how to recognize idiomatic python and best practices of programming. </p><p>I eventually landed a job doing full time Python at an awesome <a href="https://newrelic.com/">company</a>.<br/></p><p>That's why I'm excited about his new venture. This is a great opportunity for me to dive into Data Science and I can't wait to see his videos and workout the exercises.</p><p>If you're still on the fence about it, leave a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/127250310/pycast-python-and-data-science-screencasts/comments">comment</a> on his kickstarter page with your question. He's a friendly and responsive person.</p>
