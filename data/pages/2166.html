Why don't you encourage new users to use Python 3?

$ python -c "print ''.join(list(reversed('!dlrow olleH')))"<br/>-bash: !dlrow: event not found<br/><br/>Perfect way to introduce someone to the joys of escaping characters.

Perhaps<br/><br/>python -c "print('dlrow olleH'[::-1])"<br/><br/>is simpler.<br/>Cheers, D.

@Tim Shaffer: That's a good question.<br/>Partly it has been because of the issue of not all libraries having been ported to Python 3 yet, and that there has been a lot of controversy on forums about 2 vs 3, but that has been going on for a while now, and I do know that progress is being made on the porting front. Also, unless more people make the effort (both to use 3 and port stuff to it, things will stay the same). So I think you make a good point, and I'll try to write more about 3 in future, some of the time; I'm not dropping 2 entirely, at least for a while.<br/>

@anonymous #!: Yeah, I forgot about sequence slicing and that idiom until after I hit Publish.<br/><br/>Thanks for pointing it out.<br/>

I meant Anonymous #1, not #! - call it a Unixian slip :-)<br/>

@Anonymous #2:<br/><br/>&gt;Perfect way to introduce someone to the joys of escaping characters.<br/><br/>Thanks for pointing this out. But:<br/><br/>I tested it on Windows, because I was working on that at the time of writing the post. It works fine on Windows. I know about quoting issues on Unix, just didn't run it there. Also see below.<br/><br/>Did you see the labels on the post? "humor"? ... It was not really meant as a tutorial for beginners, just as a quirky hello world one-liner.<br/><br/>Also, caveat lector.<br/><br/>People should not blindly accept any code they see on the Net. Not that I meant the mistake intentionally, of course.<br/><br/>Cheers ...<br/>

@Anonymous #1: <br/><br/>&gt;I forgot about sequence slicing and that idiom <br/><br/>I mean, I obviously know slicing, but forgot that negative-stride-of-1 thing:<br/><br/>For those who don't know about slice strides in Python:<br/><br/>https://www.google.co.in/search?q=python%20slice%20stride<br/><br/>Also try these at the Python interpreter prompt:<br/><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "abcdefghij"<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; s[-1:0:-3]<br/>'jgd'<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; s[-1::-3]<br/>'jgda'<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Note the difference in the output between specifiying a 0 vs. not, for the end of the range (the middle number in the square brackets).<br/>
