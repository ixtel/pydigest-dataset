                    <p>Me and Audrey have been working hard on <a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a>, a Python/Django based project. We submitted it to PyCon StartUp row and found out this morning we've been accepted. <strong>Hooray!</strong></p>
<p>From the <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html">PyCon StartUp Row winner's post</a>, here is a little bit of what we're about:</p>
<blockquote class="highlights">
Have you tried researching products online recently? Search engines are gamed by scammy marketers. Product review sites overwhelm you with ads, have unreliable reviews, or dryly compare raw product specs. <a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a> is working to solve this problem. It is like Yelp for products, with product comparison grids inspired by the founders' open-source work on <a class="reference external" href="http://djangopackages.com">Django Packages</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.org">Open Comparison</a>.</blockquote>
<p>Just so you know, <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org">PyCon</a> in North America is the biggest gathering for the international Python community. The conference this year is in Santa Clara, California, and is sold-out at 1500+ attendees, but could have easily sold out several times that number. The talks, tutorials, and events are going to be incredible, and I'm delighted to be part of the PyCon experience!</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing the StartUp Row with friends like Transifex, Python Packages, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.weddinglovely.com/">Wedding Lovely</a>.</p>
<p>Please check out <a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a> right now and also visit our PyCon booth on Saturday, March 10th and we'll show you what we're doing.</p>
