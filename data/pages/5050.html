<span><a href="https://kenandeen.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/unisex-names-data-analysis-use-case/" target="_blank">Unisex names - Data Analysis Use Case</a></span><br/>
I've seen many websites talking about top 10 unisex names or how to choose a cool unisex name for your baby, but I don't know those so-called unisex names are based on what criteria and the authors there don't say how they got them in the first place. In this article, I present a real way to get unisex names based on historical data of used baby names as far back as the year 1880.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v65/c01/paper" target="_blank">LazySorted: A Lazily, Partially Sorted Python List</a></span><br/>
LazySorted is a Python C extension implementing a partially and lazily sorted list data structure. It solves a common problem faced by programmers, in which they need just part of a sorted list, like its middle element (the median), but sort the entire list to get it. LazySorted presents them with the abstraction that they are working with a fully sorted list, while actually only sorting the list partially with quicksort partitions to return the requested sub-elements. This enables programmers to use naive "sort first" algorithms but nonetheless attain linear run-times when possible. LazySorted may serve as a drop-in replacement for the built-in sorted function in most cases, and can sometimes achieve run-times more than 7 times faster.<br/>
