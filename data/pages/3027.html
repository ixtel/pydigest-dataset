                <p class="lead">Since its foundation in 2003, Django has grown organically into one of the most preferred open source web application frameworks for the Python programming language.</p>
<p> So, assuming you’ve already grasped the basics and are considering Django as the ideal framework for your development, why should you use it over other frameworks?</p>
<p><span id="more-1538"/></p>
<p>If you are a fan of the Python programming language, then Django is an ideal match for you. It was specifically created by the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper to work alongside Python during the building of their Python-based web applications. If you have a reasonable understanding of Python but don’t consider yourself an expert; Django’s simplicity and community support (which we’ll cover shortly) makes it an ideal beginning for any new developers out there.</p>
<p>Community is a vital resource in the land of web development. If you are looking to adopt Django and are new to the framework, then you’re probably going to find yourself searching for tutorials at some point. Not to worry; Django’s community is vast. There are tons of online resources – from written/video tutorials to online community forums – which are there for <a title="Django Tutorials" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Tutorials">you</a>. Alternatively, if you’re feeling more sociable, there’s always <a title="DjangoCon" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon</a>. DjangoCon is a huge event for users of Django which is hosted annually, with one event in Europe and one event in North America. It’s a true testament to the spirit of the Django community and could be a great way for you to hone your newly-found skills and question some of the technology experts while you’re at it.</p>
<p>Web development can be daunting. If you’ve not got a great deal of previous experience then it can feel as though you’re getting nowhere, or that its taking ages getting there! Thankfully, Django has been designed to take care of many of the common tasks for you. By handling more of the routine stuff, Django will help you focus more on your content and features for your new development. As well as allowing more time, Django allows you to add new features quicker than before. If you’re working under a strict timescale or must react to quick change requests, then Django can accompany a flexible approach to development, while encouraging rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.</p>
