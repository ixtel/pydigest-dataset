<p>A Django app providing a SSL/TLS certificate authority.</p>








<p>django-ca provides you with a local TLS certificate authority. It is based on <a href="https://pyopenssl.readthedocs.org/" rel="nofollow">pyOpenSSL</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">Django</a>, it can be used as an app in an existing Django project or with the basic project included. Certificates can be managed through Djangos admin interface or via <tt>manage.py</tt> commands - no webserver is needed, if you’re happy with the command-line.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a secure local certificate authority in just a few minutes.</li>
<li>Written in Python3.4+.</li>
<li>Manage your entire certificate authority from the command line and/or via
Djangos admin interface.</li>
<li>Get email notifications about certificates about to expire.</li>
<li>Support for certificate revocation lists (CRLs) and OCSP (both have to be
hosted separately).</li>
</ul>
