<html><body><div><div class="blog-entry" id="e20151129T074500"><p>Open source software is great.  It's hard to remember that there was a time
    before Linux, Apache, Python, Ruby, Postgres, etc.  These days, when you
    want to build something, you can start with an enormous amount of
    high-quality free infrastructure already available to you.</p><p>But there's a problem with open source: the work that goes into it is
    largely unpaid. The work that happens is because of individuals' free time
    and spare energy.  There are exceptions: many companies contribute to open
    source, some even fund developers full-time to work on it.  But the
    ecosystem is full of useful and important projects that only exist because
    someone gave away their time and energy.</p><p>Not having real funding is holding back open source, because it makes it
    hard to get started (you have to have spare time and energy), and it makes
    it hard to stick with it.  Two recent blog posts underscore this last point:
    David MacIver's <a class="offsite" rel="external" href="http://www.drmaciver.com/2015/08/throwing-in-the-towel/">Throwing in the Towel</a>,
    and Ryan Bigg's <a class="offsite" rel="external" href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/11/open-source-work/">Open source work</a>.</p><p>We've gotten pretty far on this model.  But we can do a lot better if we
    find ways to put real resources (money) into the system.  Russell Keith-Magee
    said the whole thing better than I could in his PyCon AU 2015 talk, 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY8B2lXIu6g">Money, Money, Money:
    Writing software, in a rich (wo)man's world</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>If a company can find money for foosball tables and meditative
            ball-pits, they should be able to find the resources to help
            maintain the software on which they've been basing their
            success.</p></div></blockquote><p>Russell has started a <a href="https://github.com/pybee/paying-the-piper">GitHub repo as a conversation</a>
    about how we might be able to make changes.  Each issue in
    <a href="https://github.com/pybee/paying-the-piper">Paying the Piper</a> is
    an idea for funding open source, with discussion.  Please go be part of
    it.</p><p>Personally, I think we should try <a href="https://github.com/pybee/paying-the-piper/issues/57">asking companies to donate</a>,
    and if we make it dead simple enough for them to do the right thing, they
    just might.</p><p><b>Questions for everyone:</b> do you think you could get your employer to
    donate to an open-source funding non-profit? What are the hurdles? What
    could we do together to get them over those hurdles?</p><p>Django is at the forefront of this, having just funded a part-time fund-raising
    position: <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/nov/23/introducing-dsfs-director-advancement/">Introducing the DSF's Director of Advancement</a>.
    It will be very interesting to see how that works out.</p><p>I have a double interest in this: first, the general interest in seeing the
    Python world grow and flourish.  Second, my own work on coverage.py would
    be a little easier if there were some money flowing back. It wouldn't have
    to be much, I'm not thinking I could support myself with it, but some
    tangible return would make the time easier to justify.</p></div></div></body></html>
