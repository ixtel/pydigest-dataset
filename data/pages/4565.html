<p>One of the key additions in v4.5 is <strong>Python Profiler Integration</strong>. You can easily discover captured snapshots and detailed statistics of your running application with a colored function call graph, as well as navigate to source code right from the graph. In addition, the profiler works with remote interpreters the same way as with local ones. The yappi and cProfile profilers are supported:<a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2015/05/prupd.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3236" alt="prupd" src="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2015/05/prupd.png"/></a></p>
<p>The <strong>PyCharm debugger</strong> has grown more powerful, too. Now it includes an <strong>Inline Debugger</strong> for easy inspection of variables, function parameters and objects right inside the editor. The <strong>matplotlib interactive mode</strong> now works in both Python and Debugger consoles. The debugger supports two new options, <strong>Ignore library files</strong> and <strong>Step into my code</strong>, letting you stay more focused on your own code. You can now also <strong>navigate from variables view</strong>.</p>
