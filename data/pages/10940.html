<p>I'm using <a href="https://django-model-utils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/managers.html#inheritancemanager" rel="nofollow">django-model-utils</a> inheritance manager to query a data model with multi-table inheritance and it mostly works great! What doesn't work great is when I want to <code>.select_subclasses()</code> but also filter for a specific subclass. For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Salad:
    ...

class Vegetable:
    salad = models.ForeignKey(Salad)
    ...

class Cucumber(Vegetable):
    ...

class Carrot(Vegetable):
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>I would love to be able to just get ONLY all of the <code>Cucumber</code> objects related to a specific <code>Salad</code> without any <code>Carrot</code> objects. Unfortunately, the docs don't appear to explain this. Is my best option to create a <code>type</code> field on the <code>Vegetable</code> class that I set when saving any Vegetable object that would then be available for "regular" filtering? Thanks in advance!  </p>
