<p>Introspect and display the logger tree inside "logging"</p>








<p>Introspection for the <tt>logging</tt> logger tree in the Standard Library.</p>
<p>You can install this package with the standard <tt>pip</tt> command:</p>
<pre>$ pip install logging_tree
</pre>
<p>While you can write programs that call this package’s <tt>tree()</tt>
function and examine the hierarchy of logger objects that it finds
inside of the Standard Library <tt>logging</tt> module, the simplest use of
this package for debugging is to call <tt>printout()</tt> to print the
loggers, filters, and handlers that your application has configured:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; logging.getLogger('a')
&gt;&gt;&gt; logging.getLogger('a.b').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
&gt;&gt;&gt; logging.getLogger('x.c')
&gt;&gt;&gt; from logging_tree import printout
&gt;&gt;&gt; printout()
&lt;--""
   Level WARNING
   |
   o&lt;--"a"
   |   Level NOTSET so inherits level WARNING
   |   |
   |   o&lt;--"a.b"
   |       Level DEBUG
   |
   o&lt;--[x]
       |
       o&lt;--"x.c"
           Level NOTSET so inherits level WARNING
</pre>
<p>The logger tree should always print successfully, no matter how
complicated.  A node whose <tt>[name]</tt> is in square brackets is a “place
holder” that has never actually been named in a <tt>getLogger()</tt> call,
but was created automatically to serve as the parent of loggers further
down the tree.</p>
<p>There are several interfaces that <tt>logging_tree</tt> supports, depending
on how much detail you need.</p>
<p><tt>logging_tree.printout(node=None)</tt></p>
<blockquote>
Prints the current logger tree, or the tree based at the given
<cite>node</cite>, to the standard output.</blockquote>
<p><tt>logging_tree.format.build_description(node=None)</tt></p>
<blockquote>
Builds and returns the multi-line description of the current logger
tree, or the tree based at the given <tt>node</tt>, as a single string
with newlines inside and a newline at the end.</blockquote>
<p><tt>logging_tree.format.describe(node)</tt></p>
<blockquote>
A generator that yields a series of lines that describe the tree
based at the given <tt>node</tt>.  Note that the lines are returned
without newline terminators attached.</blockquote>
<p><tt>logging_tree.tree()</tt></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fetch the current tree of loggers from the <tt>logging</tt> module.
Returns a node, that is simply a tuple with three fields:</p>
<div>
<p><tt>[0]</tt> the logger name (<tt>""</tt> for the root logger).</p>
<p><tt>[1]</tt> the <tt>logging.Logger</tt> object itself.</p>
<p><tt>[2]</tt> a list of zero or more child nodes.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I welcome contributions and ideas as this package matures.  You can find
the bug tracker at the <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/logging_tree" rel="nofollow">repository page on github</a>.  Developers can run
this package’s tests with:</p>
<pre>$ python -m unittest discover logging_tree
</pre>
<p>On older versions of Python you will instead have to install
<tt>unittest2</tt> and use its <tt>unit2</tt> command line tool to run the tests.</p>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Version 1.7</strong> - 2016 January 23</dt>
<dd>Detect whether each logger has the correct “parent” attribute and,
if not, print where its log messages are being sent instead.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 1.6</strong> - 2015 January 8</dt>
<dd>Fixed a crash that would occur if a custom logging Formatter was
missing its format string attributes.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 1.5</strong> - 2014 December 24</dt>
<dd>Handlers now display their logging level if one has been set, and
their custom logging formatter if one has been installed.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 1.4</strong> - 2014 January 8</dt>
<dd>Thanks to a contribution from Dave Brondsema, disabled loggers are
now actually marked as “Disabled” to make it less of a surprise that
they fail to log anything.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 1.3</strong> - 2013 October 29</dt>
<dd>Be explicit and display the logger level <tt>NOTSET</tt> along with the
effective level inherited from the logger’s ancestors; and display
the list of <tt>.filters</tt> of a custom logging handler even though it
might contain custom code that ignores them.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 1.2</strong> - 2013 January 19</dt>
<dd>Compatible with Python 3.3 thanks to @ralphbean.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 1.1</strong> - 2012 February 17</dt>
<dd>Now compatible with 2.3 &lt;= Python &lt;= 3.2.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 1.0</strong> - 2012 February 13</dt>
<dd>Can display the handler inside a MemoryHandler; entire public
interface documented; 100% test coverage.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 0.6</strong> - 2012 February 10</dt>
<dd>Added a display format for every <tt>logging.handlers</tt> class.</dd>
<dt><strong>Version 0.5</strong> - 2012 February 8</dt>
<dd>Initial release.</dd>
