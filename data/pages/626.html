One of the major features added is that now </p><b>F2 can be used to send the current line to the interactive console</b><p> (or the current multi-line selection).
</p><p>
It's close to what was previously used as </p><b>Ctrl+Alt+Enter</b><p>, but with some differences:
</p><p>
1. It'll fix the indentation of the code when sending things to the console (so, you shouldn't have syntax errors because of the indentation when using </p><b>Ctrl+Alt+Enter</b><p>).
</p><p>
2. When a line is sent, the cursor goes to the next line (this may seem minor, but it's a huge time-saver and makes things much smoother).
</p><p>
3. It's a single keypress! (and that was really hard to decide as all keys seem to be taken -- even </p><b>F2</b><p> -- but I think that </p><b>F2</b><p> as it was before wasn't very useful).
</p><p>
All in all, if you're into doing things interactively, things are nicer with </p><b>F2</b><p>.
</p><p>
Note: </p><b>Ctrl+Alt+Enter</b><p> can still be used to do an execfile, but aside from that, </p><b>F2</b><p> is the preferred way to send contents to the console.
</p><p>
Credit goes to Ed Catmur and James Blackburn for this feature -- I just integrated it :)

Another major feature is that the debugger now works properly when debugging multiple processes (and when a launch is terminated it'll also kill all subprocesses). This means the previous patch the debugger did to Django is no longer needed... Just </p><b>F11</b><p> to relaunch your last launch and debug multiple processes!

</p><b>Major feature #3: Ctrl+F9</b><p> (which opens a dialog for selecting which tests to run) now works properly with </p><b>py.test</b><p> too -- even if tests are not under class.

</p><b>Major feature #4: pxd and pxi</b><p> Cython files are now properly handled.
</p><p>
And as the last thing, which isn't an actual feature, but something noteworthy: </p><b>PyDev no longer changes the default encoding</b><p> (i.e.: sys.setdefaultencoding). Back when PyDev started to do that (in Python 2.4 I believe) there wasn't much choice to see unicode contents properly in the console, so, PyDev changed the default encoding to be the encoding of the console. Fast forward a bit and Python now provides a way to set the sys.stdout/stderr encodings through PYTHONIOENCODING (Python 2.6 onwards), so, PyDev now only sets that variable and no longer changes the default encoding (the main issue there is that when some application was later deployed, it could have a different default encoding and things could break because of UnicodeDecodeErrors).
</p><p>
Note that this is not all, other things were done too... See: </p><b><a href="http://pydev.org/">http://pydev.org/</a></b><p> for details -- and note that LiClipse: </p><b><a href="http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/">http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/</a></b><p> is already updated to the latest PyDev too.
