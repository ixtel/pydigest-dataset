As with many websites, one way you can do this is simply by constructing the proper URL and sending it to Craigslist. Here’s a sample URL that is returned after manually typing in a search to Craigslist:</p>
<code>http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/eby/apa?bedrooms=1&amp;pets_cat=1&amp;pets_dog=1&amp;is_furnished=1</code><p>
This is actually two separate things. The first tells craigslist what kind of thing we’re searching for:
</p><code>http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/eby/apa</code><p> says we’re searching in the sfbay area (</p><code>sfbay</code><p>) for apartments (</p><code>apa</code><p>) in the east bay (</p><code>eby</code><p>).</p><p>
The second part contains the parameters that we pass to the search:
</p><code>?bedrooms=1&amp;pets_cat=1&amp;pets_dog=1&amp;is_furnished=1</code><p> says we want 1+ bedrooms, cats allowed, dogs allowed, and furnished apartments. You can manually change these fields in order to create new queries.

<p>So, we’ll use this knowledge to send some custom URLs to Craigslist. We’ll do this using the <code>requests</code> python module, which is really useful for querying websites.</p>
