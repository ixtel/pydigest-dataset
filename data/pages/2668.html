<p>Those who use the ggplot2 package in R and do everything else in Python will appreciate <a href="https://github.com/yhat/ggplot/">this Python port of the package from yhat</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Excel makes some great looking plots, but I wouldn't be the first to say that creating charts in Excel involves a lot of manual work. Data is messy, and exploring it requires considerable effort to clean it up, transform it, and rearrange it from one format to another. R and Python make these tasks easier, allowing you to visually inspect data in several ways quickly and without tons of effort.</p>
<p>The preeminent graphics packages for R and Python are ggplot2 and matplotlib respectively. Both are feature-rich, well maintained, and highly capable. Now, I've always been a ggplot2 guy for graphics, but I'm a Python guy for everything else. As a result, I'm constantly toggling between the two languages which can become rather tedious.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once you get the Python library installed (and its dependencies), you'll be able to use the same layered graphics approach as the R package, with a similar syntax.</p>
