                <p>A common task in Python (especially while testing or debugging) is
to redirect <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout</tt> to a stream or a file while executing some piece of
code. However, simply "redirecting <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt>" is sometimes not as easy as one
would expect; hence the slightly strange title of this post. In
particular, things become interesting when you want C code running within your
Python process (including, but not limited to, Python modules implemented as C
extensions) to also have its <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt> redirected according to your wish. This
turns out to be tricky and leads us into the interesting world of file
descriptors, buffers and system calls.</p>
<p>But let's start with the basics.</p>
<div class="section" id="pure-python">
<h2>Pure Python</h2>
<p>The simplest case arises when the underlying Python code writes to <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt>,
whether by calling <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout.write</tt> or some equivalent method. If
the code you have does all its printing from Python, redirection is very easy.
With Python 3.4 we even have a built-in tool in the standard library for this
purpose - <tt class="docutils literal">contextlib.redirect_stdout</tt>. Here's how to use it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">contextlib</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">redirect_stdout</span>

<span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringIO</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">redirect_stdout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'foobar'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Got stdout: "{0}"'</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getvalue</span><span class="p">()))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>When this code runs, the actual <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> calls within the <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> block don't
emit anything to the screen, and you'll see their output captured by in the
stream <tt class="docutils literal">f</tt>. Incidentally, note how perfect the <tt class="docutils literal">with</tt> statement is for this
goal - everything within the block gets redirected; once the block is done,
things are cleaned up for you and redirection stops.</p>
<p>If you're stuck on an older and uncool Python, prior to 3.4 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a>, what then?
Well, <tt class="docutils literal">redirect_stdout</tt> is really easy to implement on your own. I'll change
its name slightly to avoid confusion:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">contextlib</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">contextmanager</span>

        <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdout</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">old_stdout</span>

<p>So we're back in the game:</p>

<p>I'm using <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt> to directly invoke the C library's <tt class="docutils literal">puts</tt> function <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[2]</a>.
This simulates what happens when C code called from within our Python code
prints to <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt> - the same would apply to a Python module using a C
extension. Another addition is the <tt class="docutils literal">os.system</tt> call to invoke a subprocess
that also prints to <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt>. What we get from this is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>this comes from C
and this is from echo
Got stdout: "foobar
12
"
</pre></div>
<p>Err... no good. The <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt>s got redirected as expected, but the output from
<tt class="docutils literal">puts</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">echo</tt> flew right past our redirector and ended up in the
terminal without being caught. What gives?</p>
<p>To grasp why this didn't work, we have to first understand what <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout</tt>
actually is in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="detour-on-file-descriptors-and-streams">
<h2>Detour - on file descriptors and streams</h2>
<p>This section dives into some internals of the operating system, the C library,
and Python <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[3]</a>. If you just want to know how to properly redirect printouts
from C in Python, you can safely skip to the next section (though understanding
<em>how</em> the redirection works will be difficult).</p>
<p>Files are opened by the OS, which keeps a system-wide table of open files, some
of which may point to the same underlying disk data (two processes can have the
same file open at the same time, each reading from a different place, etc.)</p>
<p><em>File descriptors</em> are another abstraction, which is managed per-process. Each
process has its own table of open file descriptors that point into the
system-wide table. Here's a schematic, taken from <em>The Linux Programming
Interface</em>:</p>
<img alt="File descriptor diagram" class="align-center" src="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2015/fd-inode-diagram.png"/>
<p>File descriptors allow sharing open files between processes (for example when
creating child processes with <tt class="docutils literal">fork</tt>). They're also useful for redirecting
from one entry to another, which is relevant to this post. Suppose that we make
file descriptor 5 a copy of file descriptor 4. Then all writes to 5 will behave
in the same way as writes to 4. Coupled with the fact that the standard output
is just another file descriptor on Unix (usually index 1), you can see where
this is going. The full code is given in the next section.</p>
<p>File descriptors are not the end of the story, however. You can read and write
to them with the <tt class="docutils literal">read</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">write</tt> system calls, but this is not the way
things are typically done. The C runtime library provides a convenient
abstraction around file descriptors - streams. These are exposed to the
programmer as the opaque <tt class="docutils literal">FILE</tt> structure with a set of functions that act on
it (for example <tt class="docutils literal">fprintf</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">fgets</tt>).</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">FILE</tt> is a fairly complex structure, but the most important things to know
about it is that it holds a file descriptor to which the actual system calls are
directed, and it provides <em>buffering</em>, to ensure that the system call (which is
expensive) is not called too often. Suppose you emit stuff to a binary file, a
byte or two at a time. Unbuffered writes to the file descriptor with <tt class="docutils literal">write</tt>
would be quite expensive because each write invokes a system call. On the other
hand, using <tt class="docutils literal">fwrite</tt> is much cheaper because the typicall call to this
function just copies your data into its internal buffer and advances a pointer.
Only occasionally (depending on the buffer size and flags) will an actual
<tt class="docutils literal">write</tt> system call be issued.</p>
<p>With this information in hand, it should be easy to understand what <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt>
actually is for a C program. <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt> is a global <tt class="docutils literal">FILE</tt> object kept for us
by the C library, and it buffers output to file descriptor number 1. Calls to
functions like <tt class="docutils literal">printf</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">puts</tt> add data into this buffer. <tt class="docutils literal">fflush</tt>
forces its flushing to the file descriptor, and so on.</p>
<p>But we're talking about Python here, not C. So how does Python translate calls
to <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout.write</tt> to actual output?</p>
<p>Python uses its own abstraction over the underlying file descriptor - a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/dev/glossary.html#term-file-object">file
object</a>. Moreover,
in Python 3 this file object is further wrapper in an <tt class="docutils literal">io.TextIOWrapper</tt>,
because what we pass to <tt class="docutils literal">print</tt> is a Unicode string, but the underlying
<tt class="docutils literal">write</tt> system calls accept binary data, so encoding has to happen en route.</p>
<p>The important take-away from this is: Python and a C extension loaded by it
(this is similarly relevant to C code invoked via <tt class="docutils literal">ctypes</tt>) run in the same
process, and share the underlying file descriptor for standard output. However,
while Python has its own high-level wrapper around it - <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout</tt>, the C
code uses its own <tt class="docutils literal">FILE</tt> object. Therefore, simply replacing <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout</tt>
cannot, in principle, affect output from C code. To make the replacement deeper,
we have to touch something shared by the Python and C runtimes - the file
descriptor.</p>

<p>There are a lot of details here (such as managing the temporary file into which
output is redirected) that may obscure the key approach: using <tt class="docutils literal">dup</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">dup2</tt> to manipulate file descriptors. These functions let us duplicate file
descriptors and make any descriptor point at any file. I won't spend more time
on them - go ahead and read their documentation, if you're interested. The
detour section should provide enough background to understand it.</p>
<p>Let's try this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">BytesIO</span><span class="p">()</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Gives us:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Got stdout: "and this is from echo
this comes from C
foobar
12
"
</pre></div>
<p>Success! A few things to note:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The output order may not be what we expected. This is due to buffering. If
it's important to preserve order between different kinds of output (i.e.
between C and Python), further work is required to disable buffering on all
relevant streams.</li>
<li>You may wonder why the output of <tt class="docutils literal">echo</tt> was redirected at all? The answer
is that file descriptors are <em>inherited</em> by subprocesses. Since we rigged fd
1 to point to our file instead of the standard output prior to forking to
<tt class="docutils literal">echo</tt>, this is where its output went.</li>
<li>We use a <tt class="docutils literal">BytesIO</tt> here. This is because on the lowest level, the file
descriptors are binary. It may be possible to do the decoding when copying
from the temporary file into the given stream, but that can hide problems.
Python has its in-memory understanding of Unicode, but who knows what is the
right encoding for data printed out from underlying C code? This is why this
particular redirection approach leaves the decoding to the caller.</li>
<li>The above also makes this code specific to Python 3. There's no magic
involved, and porting to Python 2 is trivial, but some assumptions made here
don't hold (such as <tt class="docutils literal">sys.stdout</tt> being a <tt class="docutils literal">io.TextIOWrapper</tt>).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redirecting-the-stdout-of-a-child-process">
<h2>Redirecting the stdout of a child process</h2>
<p>We've just seen that the file descriptor duplication approach lets us grab the
output from child processes as well. But it may not always be the most
convenient way to achieve this task. In the general case, you typically use the
<tt class="docutils literal">subprocess</tt> module to launch child processes, and you may launch several such
processes either in a pipe or separately. Some programs will even juggle
multiple subprocesses launched this way in different threads. Moreover, while
these subprocesses are running you may want to emit something to <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt> and
you don't want this output to be captured.</p>
<p>So, managing the <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt> file descriptor in the general case can be messy;
it is also unnecessary, because there's a much simpler way.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">subprocess</tt> module's swiss knife <tt class="docutils literal">Popen</tt> class (which serve as the
basis for much of the rest of the module) accepts a <tt class="docutils literal">stdout</tt> parameter, which
we can use to ask it to get access to the child's stdout:</p>

<span class="n">proc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">echo_cmd</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PIPE</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">communicate</span><span class="p">()[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Got stdout:'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">subprocess.PIPE</tt> argument can be used to set up actual child process
pipes (a la the shell), but in its simplest incarnation it captures the
process's output.</p>
<p>If you only launch a single child process at a time and are interested in its
output, there's an even simpler way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">check_output</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">echo_cmd</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'Got stdout:'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">check_output</tt> will capture and return the child's standard output to you; it
will also raise an exception if the child exist with a non-zero return code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope I covered most of the common cases where "stdout redirection" is needed
in Python. Naturally, all of the same applies to the other standard output
stream - <tt class="docutils literal">stderr</tt>. Also, I hope the background on file descriptors was
sufficiently clear to explain the redirection code; squeezing this topic in such
a short space is challenging. Let me know if any questions remain or if there's
something I could have explained better.</p>
<p>Finally, while it is conceptually simple, the code for the redirector is quite
long; I'll be happy to hear if you find a shorter way to achieve the same
effect.</p>
