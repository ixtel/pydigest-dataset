<li>
<p class="first">Function in-lining is now present in the code, but still disabled, because it
needs more changes in other areas, before we can generally do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Trivial outlines, result of re-formulations or function in-lining, are now
in-lined, in case they just return an expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The re-formulation for <tt class="docutils literal">or</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">and</tt> has been giving up, eliminating the
use of a <tt class="docutils literal">try</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">finally</tt> expression, at the cost of dedicated boolean
nodes and code generation for these.</p>
<p>This saves around 8% of compile time memory for Nuitka, and allows for faster
and more complete optimization, and gets rid of a complicated structure for
analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">When a frame is used in an exception, its locals are detached. This was done
more often than necessary and even for frames that are not necessary our own
ones. This will speed up some exception cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">When the default arguments, or the keyword default arguments (Python3) or
the annotations (Python3) were raising an exception, the function definition
is now replaced with the exception, saving a code generation. This happens
frequently with Python2/Python3 compatible code guarded by version checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The SSA analysis for loops now properly traces "break" statement situations
and merges the post-loop situation from all of them. This significantly
allows for and improves optimization of code following the loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The SSA analysis of <tt class="docutils literal">try</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">finally</tt> statements has been greatly enhanced.
The handler for <tt class="docutils literal">finally</tt> is now optimized for exception raise and no
exception raise individually, as well as for <tt class="docutils literal">break</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">continue</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">return</tt> in the tried code. The SSA analysis for after the statement is now
the result of merging these different cases, should they not abort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The code generation for <cite>del</cite> statements is now taking advantage should there
be definite knowledge of previous value. This speed them up slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The SSA analysis of <cite>del</cite> statements now properly decided if the statement
can raise or not, allowing for more optimization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">For list contractions, the re-formulation was enhanced using the new outline
construct instead of a pseudo function, leading to better analysis and code
generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Comparison chains are now re-formulated into outlines too, allowing for better
analysis of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Exceptions raised in function creations, e.g. in default values, are now
propagated, eliminating the function's code. This happens most often with
Python2/Python3 in branches. On the other hand, function creations that
cannot are also annotated now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Closure variables that become unreferenced outside of the function become
normal variables leading to better tracing and code generation for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Function creations cannot raise except their defaults, keyword defaults or
annotations do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Built-in references can now be converted to strings at compile time, e.g.
when printed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
