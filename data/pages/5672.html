<p>Hypothesis is a library for testing your Python code against a much larger range
of examples than you would ever want to write by hand. It's based on the Haskell
library, Quickcheck, and is designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing
Python unit testing work flow.</p>
<p>Hypothesis is both extremely practical and also advances the state of the art of
unit testing by some way. It's easy to use, stable, and extremely powerful. If
you're not using Hypothesis to test your project then you're missing out.</p>

<p>Hypothesis officially supports CPython 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5, as well as PyPy. Other
versions are not supported. Patches for such versions are accepted as long as
they don't impose a maintenance burden. However, keep in mind that this does
not automatically mean that future releases of Hypothesis will continue to work
on those versions.</p>
