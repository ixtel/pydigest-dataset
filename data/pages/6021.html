<br/>
<span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0501/" target="_blank">PEP 0501 -- Translation ready string interpolation</a></span><br/>
This PEP agrees with the basic motivation of PEP 498 , but proposes to focus both the syntax and the implementation on the il8n use case, drawing on the previous proposals in PEP 292 (which added string.Template) and its predecessor PEP 215 (which proposed syntactic support, rather than a runtime string manipulation based approach). <br/>

<span><a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/20/interactive-python-and-teaching-python-beyond-text-books" target="_blank">Episode #20: Interactive Python and Teaching Python: Beyond Text Books</a></span><br/>
What if your computer science textbooks could run their python code samples and that code ran directly in your browser, kinda like JavaScript but better, because: Python. It is possible and Brad Miller is making it happen! This episode is all about Brad Miller's work at Runestone Interactive where they are building the next generation of interactive textbooks for computer science students and the rest of us. As a cool side-effect, Brad is now maintaining Skulpt, one of the leading implementations of Python that runs in your browser! <br/>

<span><a href="http://podcastinit.com/liza-avramenko-checkio.html" target="_blank">Episode 18 - Liza Avramenko Talks About CheckIO</a></span><br/>
In this episode we talked to Liza Avramenko, the CEO of CheckIO, about Empire of Code and CheckIO. We discussed what differentiates them from each other and from the other coding games that have been spreading on the internet. One of the main differentiators for CheckIO in particular is the strong focus on community. The bottom line is that if you use Python then you should check out CheckIO and Empire of Code as a great way to practice your skills.<br/>

<span><a href="http://isaacslavitt.com/2015/08/08/speeding-up-with-cython/" target="_blank">Speeding up non-vectorizable code with Cython</a></span><br/>
Most people know that when working with numeric arrays in Python, it is almost always faster to use vectorized operations instead of loops. But what happens when there's no obvious way to vectorize a slow function? There are many approaches for speeding up code, and plenty of other great posts on the subject. This is just a simple example with Cython.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://betatim.github.io/posts/bayesian-hyperparameter-search/" target="_blank">Bayesian optimisation for smart hyperparameter search</a></span><br/>
Fitting a single classifier does not take long, fitting hundreds takes a while. To find the best hyperparameters you need to fit a lot of classifiers. What to do? This post explores the inner workings of an algorithm you can use to reduce the number of hyperparameter sets you need to try before finding the best set. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://blog.ibis-project.org/design-modeling-analytics-1/" target="_blank">Ibis Design: Modeling high level analytics tasks</a></span><br/>
Outside of scalability and high performance on large data sets with Python, Ibis is focused on simplifying analytics tasks for end users. By designing a rich pandas-like domain specific language (DSL) embedded in Python code, we can hide away the complexities normally associated with expressing analytical concepts in SQL or some other tool. This post gives some specific examples and shows how we're solving them in Ibis.<br/>

This book teaches you to design and develop data mining applications using a variety of datasets, starting with basic classification and affinity analysis. Next, we move on to more complex data types including text, images, and graphs. In every chapter, we create models that solve real-world problems.<br/>

<strong><span><span><span>Upcoming Events and Webinars</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3446" target="_blank">Webinar: Automate boring keyboard and mouse tasks with Python GUI</a></span><br/>
Sometimes an application or service doesn't support an API or batch processing. But you can still automate tasks with code that directly controls the mouse and keyboard. In this webcast, Al Sweigart covers the Python GUI automation techniques described in his latest book, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3477" target="_blank">Webinar: Explore algorithms in Python with a GUI-based app</a></span> <br/>
Algorithms are at the heart of Computer Science and they have a very real practical impact for Software Engineers. Too often, textbooks and Internet resources contain just the final code that implements an algorithm without any explanation or guidelines on how it was designed and implemented. In this webcast, I will demonstrate the principles behind kd-trees and how they can be used to solve a number of interesting problems, such as nearest neighbor and range queries. I will implement a GUI-based application that draws the kd-tree as points are inserted and performs nearest neighbor queries.<br/>
