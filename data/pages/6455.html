<p>The purpose of this next section is to look at how players performed last year.  The purpose is two fold.</p>
<p>1)  By looking at a full season's performance, its good to get a better understanding of a players consistency or lack there of.  Typically ESPN and other website just show how a player did overall.  This can be tricky because if a player has a two bad weeks, you may bench him and miss his good week.</p>
<p>2 )  Sometimes younger players tend to break out in the second half of the season.   I couldn't find a resource that would show fantasy points from game 8 onwards.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, I found a website that told me how each player did each week.  All I had to do was create a simple webscraper in order to go through the four majors positions.  This would give me every players stats for every week in one csv file.</p>
