				<a id="dd_start"/><p>When you want to create the greatest possible mobile app that you can build, you likely already realize that you’ll need a strong foundation to start with. Building an exceptional mobile app isn’t so different from crafting a luxury home in this respect. It all begins with the blueprint, base and groundwork. In the case of mobile, you’ll need a strong and durable mockup before you even consider putting your development team to work. Thankfully, app entrepreneurs have been gifted with an abundance of options to choose from when it comes to selecting a top-quality mockup tool to use.</p>
<p>And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with performing your initial mockups on paper. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. There’s even something special about telling a friend your spontaneous new app idea, while immediately sketching out its wireframe on notebook paper.</p>
<p>But, we’ve put together a list of The Best Mockup Tools for App Entrepreneurs for when you’re ready to make your mobile app mockup official. Your developers will thank you.</p>
