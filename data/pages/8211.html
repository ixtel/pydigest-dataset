Its principle feature is a Size class from</p><p>which can be constructed Size objects which represent a precise and finite</p><p>quantity of bytes. Various arithmetic operations are defined for Size objects.</p><p>Its sole purpose is the representation of real quantities of memory on real</p><p>machines. For that reason, it does not allow powers of bytes, imprecise</p><p>quantities of bytes, or non-finite quantities of bytes. In order that the</p><p>usual laws of arithmetic can be maintained, it does allow fractional quantities</p><p>of bytes.</p><p>Practical Computing with Bytes</p><p>------------------------------</p><p>When computing with bytes, the numeric value can be viewed as a logical,</p><p>rather than a physical, quantity. That is, unlike, e.g., mass or length,</p><p>which are quantities which must be measured with a measuring instrument</p><p>which has some built-in imprecision, the number of bytes of memory in RAM,</p><p>or on a disk, is a quantity that is not measured, but is known precisely.</p><p>Consequently, computations such as addition of two Sizes, and conversion</p><p>between different magnitudes of bytes, i.e., from MiB to GiB, must be done</p><p>precisely. The underlying implementation must therefore use a precise</p><p>representation of the number of bytes. Floating point numbers, which are</p><p>frequently the preferred type for the representation of physical</p><p>quantities, are disallowed by this requirement.</p><p>Operations</p><p>----------</p><p>This module does not accomodate multi-dimensionality of byte quantities.</p><p>Consequently, multiplying one Size object by another Size object will cause</p><p>an error to be raised, since bytes^2 is not representable by the module.</p><p>For most uses any operation which would yield a multi-dimensional quantity</p><p>of bytes is not useful. There are no plans to adapt this package so that it</p><p>can accomodate multi-dimensionality of bytes.</p><p>Numerous computations with bytes are nonsensical. For example, 2 raised to a</p><p>power which is some number of bytes, is a meaningless computation. All such</p><p>operations cause an error to be raised.</p><p>The result type of operations is a Size, where appropriate, or a subtype of</p><p>Rational, where a numeric value is appropriate.</p><p>Floating Point Numbers</p><p>----------------------</p><p>It is not possible to use floating point numbers in computations with Sizes.</p><p>Where a fractional quantity is desired, use Decimal objects instead of floats.</p><p>Thus, Size(0) * 1.2 raises an exception, but Size(0) * Decimal("1.2") is</p><p>acceptable.</p><p>Displaying Sizes</p><p>----------------</p><p>Sizes are displayed according to a specified configuration. In the default</p><p>configuration, Sizes are displayed using binary rather than SI prefixes</p><p>or names, regardless of the value. For example, 1000 bytes is not displayed</p><p>as 1KB (1 kilobyte), but as some number of bytes or KiB (kibibytes).</p><p>The detailed representation of Sizes uses a precise decimal representation</p><p>that includes the repeating portion, if any.</p><p>Representing Units</p><p>------------------</p><p>The size module supplies a set of named prefixes for both SI and binary units,</p><p>for all non-fractional prefixes. Fractional prefixes are not defined.</p><p>Constructing Sizes Programatically</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>New Size objects can be constructed from Size objects, numeric values, e.g.,</p><p>int or Decimal, or strings which represent such numeric values.</p><p>strings may be used to represent fractional quantities, e.g., "1.2", but</p><p>floats are disallowed.</p><p>The constructor takes an optional units specifier, which defaults to bytes</p><p>for all numeric values, and to None for Size objects. The type of the</p><p>unit specifier is a named prefix supplied by the size module or a Size object.</p><p>Errors</p><p>------</p><p>All errors raised by justbytes operations are subtypes of the SizeError class.</p><p>Alternative Packages</p><p>--------------------</p><p>If you are interested in computing in Python with physical, rather than</p><p>logical, quantities, you should consult the pint package:</p><p>http://pint.readthedocs.org.
