<p>Hello, fellow gamblers!, 
</p>
<p>Today we present our newest chance based mission: <a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/texas-referee/share/de35c14e2b7c586ba94d6faa694832f3/"><img src="https://checkio.s3.amazonaws.com/logos/task/middle/texas-referee-off.png"/></a><a href="http://www.checkio.org/mission/texas-referee/share/de35c14e2b7c586ba94d6faa694832f3/">"Texas Referee"</a>: It is based on idea, suggested by one of our players in <a href="http://www.checkio.org/forum/post/2977/mission-ideas/">Mission Ideas </a> forum thread:</p>
<p>Texas hold'em is a variation of the standard card game of poker. Two cards are dealt face down to each player and then five community cards are placed face-up by the dealer. With these cards, we need to define what combination a player has.</p>
<p>You are given a sequence of 7 cards and you should choose the best hand (5 cards) in it. Card sequences are described as strings, where each card are defined by two factors: rank and suit. Cards are separated by commas.</p>
<p>Your goal is to choose the best 5 card hand  and return them as a string in order from the highest to lowest.</p>
<p>Hopefully you'll enjoy this mission as much as we've enjoyed building it for you!</p>
<p>But that's not all! We have even more gambling games in the CiO vaults which you may have missed, so here's a few from the list:</p>
