<p>This is to inform you about the new stable release of <a class="reference external" href="http://nuitka.net">Nuitka</a>. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler. Please see the page <a class="reference external" href="../pages/overview.html">"What is Nuitka?"</a> for an overview.</p>
<p>This release brings corrections and major improvements to how standalone mode
performs. Much of it was contributed via patches and bug reports.</p>
<div class="section" id="bug-fixes">
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There was a crash when using <tt class="docutils literal">next</tt> on a non-iterable. Fixed in 0.5.0.1
already.</li>
<li>Module names with special characters not allowed in C identifiers were not
fully supported. <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue118">Issue#118</a>. Fixed in
0.5.0.1 already.</li>
<li>Name mangling for classes with leading underscores was not removing them from
resulting attribute names. This broke at <tt class="docutils literal">__slots__</tt> with private attributes
for such classes. <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue119">Issue#119</a>. Fixed in
0.5.0.1 already.</li>
<li>Standalone on Windows might need "cp430" encoding. <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue120">Issue#120</a>. Fixed in 0.5.0.2 already.</li>
<li>Standalone mode didn't work with <tt class="docutils literal">lxml.etree</tt> due to lack of hard coded
dependencies. When a shared library imports things, Nuitka cannot detect it
easily.</li>
<li>Wasn't working on MacOS 64 bits due to using Linux 64 bits specific
code. <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.nuitka.net/issue123">Issue#123</a>. Fixed in 0.5.0.2
already.</li>
<li>On MinGW the constants blob was not properly linked on some installations,
this is now done differently (see below).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-features">
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Memory usages are now traced with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--show-progress</span></tt> allowing us to trace
where things go wrong.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-optimization">
<h2>New Optimization</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Standalone mode now includes standard library as bytecode by default. This is
workaround scalability issues with many constants from many modules. Future
releases are going to undo it.</li>
<li>On Windows the constants blob is now stored as a resource, avoiding
compilation via C code for MSVC as well. MinGW was changed to use the same
code.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-tests">
<h2>New Tests</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Expanded test coverage for "standalone mode" demonstrating usage of "hex"
encoding, PySide, and PyGtk packages.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This release is mostly an interim maintenance release for standalone. Major
changes that provide optimization beyond that, termed "C-ish code generation"
are delayed for future releases.</p>
<p>This release makes standalone practical which is an important point. Instead of
hour long compilation, even for small programs, we are down to less than a
minute.</p>
<p>The solution of the scalability issues with many constants from many modules
will be top priority going forward. Since they are about how even single use
constants are created all in one place, this will be easy, but as large changes
are happening in "C-ish code generation", we are waiting for these to complete.</p>
