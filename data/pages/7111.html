<span><a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/29/python-at-the-large-hadron-collider-and-cern" target="_blank">Episode #29: Python at the Large Hadron Collider and CERN</a></span><br/>
The largest machine ever built is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It's primary goal was the discovery of the Higgs Boson: the fundamental particle which gives all objects mass. The LHC team of 1000's of physicists achieved that goal in 2012 winning the Nobel Prize in physics. Kyle Cranmer is here to share how Python was at the core of this amazing achievement! You'll learn about the different experiment including ATLAST and CMS. We talk a bit about the physics involved in the discovery before digging into the software and computer technology used at CERN.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2015/oct/13/wats-doc/" target="_blank">Wat's up, doc?</a></span><br/>
In much the same vein as Gary Bernhardt's wonderful talk about JavaScript, there's a collection of Python "wat" moments which goes around every so often. There's also an associated quiz linked from that page. Every language has some unintuitive -- or at least seemingly-unintuitive -- bits, and Python is no exception. But if you're working in Python, understanding why (or, perhaps more appropriately, wy) these snippets of code behave the way they do is interesting and potentially useful. So let's take a look at them and see what's really going on.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-3-backpropagation-through-time-and-vanishing-gradients/" target="_blank">Recurrent Neural Networks Tutorial, Part 3 - Backpropagation Through Time and Vanishing Gradients</a></span><br/>
In this part we'll give a brief overview of BPTT and explain how it differs from traditional backpropagation. We will then try to understand the vanishing gradient problem, which has led to the development of  LSTMs and GRUs, two of the currently most popular and powerful models used in NLP (and other areas). <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://blog.dominodatalab.com/creating-interactive-crime-maps-with-folium/" target="_blank">Creating interactive crime maps with Folium</a></span><br/>
This post outlines how to use Folium to visualize a data set about crime in San Francisco. It then describes a how to use Domino to turn this Python code into a self-service reporting tool.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://pythonpodcast.com/trent-nelson-pyparallel.html" target="_blank">Episode 27 - Trent Nelson on Pyparallels</a></span><br/>
Trent Nelson is a software engineer working with Continuum Analytics and a core contributor to CPython. He started experimenting with a way to sidestep the restrictions of the Global Interpreter Lock without discarding its benefits and that has become the PyParallel project. We had the privilege of discussing the details around this innovative experiment with Trent and learning more about the challenges he has experienced, what motivated him to start the project, and what it can offer to the community.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/12/scraping-images-with-python-and-scrapy/" target="_blank">Scraping images with Python and Scrapy</a></span><br/>
In this post you will learn how to use Python scrape all cover images of Time magazine. To accomplish this task, we utilize Scrapy, a fast and powerful web scraping framework. Overall, our entire spider file consisted of less than 44 lines of code which really demonstrates the power and abstraction behind the Scrapy libray.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-vs-r/" target="_blank">R vs Python: head to head data analysis</a></span><br/>
There have been dozens of articles written comparing Python and R from a subjective standpoint. We'll add our own views at some point, but this article aims to look at the languages more objectively. We'll analyze a dataset side by side in Python and R, and show what code is needed in both languages to achieve the same result. This will let us understand the strengths and weaknesses of each language without the conjecture. <br/>

<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEwgZNC-KyE" target="_blank">Preparing for a Python Interview: 10 Things You Should Know</a></span><br/>
In this video, we will go over 10 different things you should know before going in to your first Python interview. It is mainly useful if you are applying for an entry level position.<br/>

<span><a href="http://blog.insightdatalabs.com/visualizing-classifier-thresholds/" target="_blank">Visualizing Machine Learning Thresholds to Make Better Business Decisions</a></span><br/>
Thresholding is a simple and effective strategy for creating value from a machine learning classifier. Once you've decided to threshold, data visualization techniques like the ones in this post will let you understand the tradeoffs you face for each possible threshold choice -- and thus help you choose the most value-creating threshold for your particular business application.<br/>
