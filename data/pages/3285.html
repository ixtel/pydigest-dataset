Welcome to the official website of the game Somewhat Odd. The game was created by Daniel Strain as a solo project.

<p>Yes I know the way you need to run the game is rather convoluted, there is no simple way to make it as simple as others that I can both find and comprehend. I'll be attempting to make the process easier (e.g just offering a .exe file or something for download) but at the moment you'll have to bear with me. I'm doing a lot of work with blobs of text and thousand line files to try getting it to work.</p>
