<p>Abstract build system shim providing setup.py</p>








<p>Abstract build system shim providing setup.py</p>
<p>This repository provides a shim so that projects using non-setuptools build
systems which can be built using the PEP XX [#pepxx] abstract build interface,
can be installed by older pip versions which do not implement the interface.</p>

<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Copy <tt>shim.py</tt> from this project into your source tree as
<tt>setup.py</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>Once this is done, calling <tt>setup.py</tt> will trigger easy-install to make
<tt>setuptools_shim</tt> and its dependencies as well as the bootstrap requirements
from <tt>pypa.json</tt> available at build/install time.</p>
