<span><a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/show/17/python-on-bare-metal-with-micropython" target="_blank">Episode #17: Python on bare metal with MicroPython</a></span><br/>
How many layers of abstraction and indirection are between your python code and machine instructions? What if that number could be 1 and Python itself was the operating system? That would be so amazing, right? In fact, it is amazing and it's called Micropython. Join Michael and Damien as they discuss the genesis, philosophy, internals, and more about MicroPython; Damien's Python on a chip implementation. <br/>

<span><a href="https://indico.io/blog/plotlines" target="_blank">Exploring the shapes of stories using Python and sentiment APIs</a></span><br/>
Using two hacks and a multinomial logistic regression model of n-grams with TF-IDF features, a pre-trained sentiment model can score the long-range sentiment of text of stories, books, and movies. The models do a reasonable job of summarizing the "shapes of stories" directly from text. This method can be easily extended to search across databases to find stories with similar plot shape as the query story.<br/>

<span><a href="http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/decision-marking-under-uncertainty-2.html" target="_blank">Decision Making Under Uncertainty: An Introduction to Robust Optimization (Part 2)</a></span><br/>
The idea behind Robust Optimization (RO) is to find solutions to an optimization problem such that these solutions are not very sensitive to changes in parameters. Many day-to-day problems are modeled as deterministic problems while in reality there is uncertainty involved in the model. In many cases, the solution obtained through a deterministic model will have very low quality or be infeasible with minor changes in the parameters. In other words, the solution is not very robust. RO methodology aims to address this issue. In this post, we'll introduce a modeling approach for RO introduced by Bertsimas and Sim (2004).<br/>

<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsorlkAF83s" target="_blank">Real Time Web Apps with (just) Python and Postgres</a></span><br/>
In this presentation, I show how to build a web application with a UI that updates in real time as users make changes, using a simple Python+Postgres stack.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gol_qOgRqfA" target="_blank">How to find the best model parameters in scikit-learn</a></span><br/>
In this video, you'll learn how to efficiently search for the optimal tuning parameters (or "hyperparameters") for your machine learning model in order to maximize its performance. I'll start by demonstrating an exhaustive "grid search" process using scikit-learn's GridSearchCV class, and then I'll compare it with RandomizedSearchCV, which can often achieve similar results in far less time.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://charlesleifer.com/blog/introduction-to-the-fast-new-unqlite-python-bindings/" target="_blank">Introduction to the fast new UnQLite Python Bindings</a></span><br/>
In this post I'll quickly touch on the features of UnQLite, then show you how to use the Python bindings. When you're done reading you should hopefully be ready to use UnQLite in your next Python project.<br/>

This book gives you an arsenal of Python scripts perfect to use or to customize your needs for each stage of the testing process. Each chapter takes you step by step through the methods of designing and modifying scripts to attack web apps. You will learn how to collect both open and hidden information from websites to further your attacks, identify vulnerabilities, perform SQL Injections, exploit cookies, and enumerate poorly configured systems. You will also discover how to crack encryption, create payloads to mimic malware, and create tools to output your findings into presentable formats for reporting to your employers.<br/>

<strong><span><span><span>Interesting Projects, Tools and Libraries</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/cloudera/ibis" target="_blank">Ibis</a></span><br/>
Ibis is a Python data analysis library enabling a 100% Python user workflow on top of big data systems for maximum performance and scalability. It was co-created by the creator of pandas and designed to have a familiar user interface for folks used to small data on single machines in Python.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/stitchfix/pyxley" target="_blank">Pyxley</a></span><br/>
The Pyxley python library makes use of the pyxleyJS React components to create Flask-based web applications. Through the use of the PyReact library, we can use Jinja templating to construct and transform a single React component. The specific UI components are passed as props to the parent component. A simpler interface is provided through the use of specific wrappers for each of the component types.<br/>

Bolt provides a Python interface to local and distributed multi-dimensional arrays. Aims to optimize performance whether data are small, medium, or very, very large, all through a common and familiar ndarray interface. The core is 100% Python. Currently backed by NumPy (local) or Spark (distributed) and will expand to others in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/trendvis" target="_blank">TrendVis</a></span><br/>
TrendVis is a plotting package that uses matplotlib to create information-dense, sparkline-like, quantitative visualizations of multiple disparate data sets in a common plot area against a common variable. This plot type is particularly well-suited for time-series data.<br/>
