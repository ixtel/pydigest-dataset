<p>CFFI 1.0.1 final has now been released for CPython!  CFFI is a (CPython and PyPy) module to interact with C code from Python.</p>
<p>The main news from CFFI 0.9 is the new way to build extension modules:
the "out-of-line" mode, where you have a separate build script.  When
this script is executed, it produces the extension module.  This comes
with associated Setuptools support that fixes the headache of
distributing your own CFFI-using packages.  It also massively cuts
down the import times.</p>
<p>Although this is a major new version, it should be fully
backward-compatible: existing projects should continue to work, in
what is now called the "in-line mode".</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">documentation</a> has been reorganized and split into a few pages.
For more information about this new "out-of-line" mode, as well as
more general information about what CFFI is and how to use it, read the <a href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#goals">Goals</a> and proceed to
the <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/overview.html">Overview</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.ch/2015/05/cffi-10-beta-1.html">1.0 beta 1 version</a> (ffi.dlopen(), instead of only
<tt class="docutils literal">ffi.verify()</tt>.</p>
<p><em>PyPy support:</em> PyPy needs integrated support for efficient JITting,
so you cannot install a different version of CFFI on top of an
existing PyPy.  You need to wait for the upcoming PyPy 2.6 to use
CFFI 1.0---or get a <a class="reference external" href="http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/">nightly build</a>.</p>
<p>My thanks again to the PSF (Python Software Foundation) for their
financial support!</p>

<strong>UPDATE:</strong><p>Bug with the first example "ABI out-of-line": variadic functions (like printf, ending in a "..." argument) crash.  Fixed in CFFI 1.0.2.</p>
