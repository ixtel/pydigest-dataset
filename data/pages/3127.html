Installed d:\python25\lib\site-packages\pylons-0.9.7rc3dev_20081103-py2.5.egg
Reading http://www.pylonshq.com/download/0.9.7
error: Could not find required distribution Pylons==dev
</pre><p>I imagine it would match if the package would literally have the version "dev".</p><p>One solution is to change the <tt class="docutils literal">install_requires</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">["Pylons==dev,!=foo"]</span></tt> or some other bogus version to match whatever is downloaded for the <tt class="docutils literal">dev</tt> version. "<tt class="docutils literal">&gt;=0.1.2.3</tt> " will match for packages that don't have tagged versions (won't work for example for Pylons "0.9.7beta3dev-20080422").</p><p>EDIT: Looks like I was wrong. having "!=foo" will work if you already have the package installed but will fail to find the dev package when downloading. Having "&gt;=0.9.7" in the requirements will not work because "0.9.7beta3dev-20080422" is considered a lower version (prerelease to the final 0.9.7). A solution would be having a requirement like "&gt;=0.9.7a". "a" will be lower than "beta3dev-20080422".</p></div></div></body></html>
