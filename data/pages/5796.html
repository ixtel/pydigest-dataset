<h3 id="Conclusions:">Conclusions:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusions:">¶</a></h3><p>The combination of IPython, Pandas and Scikit Learn let us pull in some junky data, clean it up, plot it, understand it and slap it with some machine learning!</p>
<p>Clearly a lot more formality could be used, plotting learning curves, adjusting for overfitting, feature selection, on and on... there are some really great machine learning resources that cover this deeper material. In particular we highly recommend the work and presentations of Olivier Grisel at INRIA Saclay. <a href="http://ogrisel.com/">http://ogrisel.com/</a></p>
