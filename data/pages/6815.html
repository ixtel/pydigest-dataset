        Python Programming Challenge - First to Five
        
    </h1>
    
  </header>


<div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>We’ve partnered with our friends at <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/">Interview Cake</a> to bring you a programming challenge to test your logic skills and abilities.</p>




<p><strong>Updated 10/16/2015:</strong> Added additional challenges – cheers!</p>

<a name="The.Challenge"/>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<ol>
<li>There are two players.</li>
<li>Each player writes a number, hidden from the other player. It can be any integer 1 or greater.</li>
<li>The players reveal their numbers.</li>
<li>Whoever chose the lower number gets 1 point, unless the lower number is lower by only 1, then the player with the higher number gets 2 points.</li>
<li>If they both chose the same number, neither player gets a point.</li>
<li>This repeats, and the game ends when one player has 5 points.</li>
</ol>


<p>The challenge is to write a script to play this game. Knowing the rules and all your opponent’s previous numbers, can you program a strategy? (And, no – <code>return random.randint(1, 3)</code> is not a strategy.) You should really try playing this first with your friends – you’ll see there’s a deep human element to predicting your opponent’s choice.</p>

<p>Is it possible to program a strong strategy?</p>

<blockquote><p>Want to make the strategy a bit more interesting? Add an additional constraint to the challenge so that players can only use each number once. <em>The first ten working submissions get a free copy of Real Python! (still open to submissions)</em></p></blockquote>

<a name="The.Prizes"/>
<h2>The Prizes</h2>

<p>Need some motivation? We’ll be giving out prizes to the strategies that perform the best:</p>




<blockquote><p>Although the challenge is officially over (<a href="https://gist.github.com/mjhea0/c21178d0cbf9e364c707">results</a>) you can still partake! First, see if you can beat the <a href="https://gist.github.com/mjhea0/d7fc846ea8ab2b03e819">current</a> winner to receive $20 off of Real Python. Second, create a web application with Flask that (a) makes it easy to add a new strategy and then (b) runs a given strategy against all the other strategies.</p></blockquote>

<a name="Grading"/>
<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>The grading is simple: We’ll run each strategy through the random number generator 100 times as a first screen – <code>return random.randrange(1, 10)</code>. The strategies that beat the generator we’ll then be ran against one other in a round robin format to determine the overall winners. <em>Be sure to test your code out in the <a href="https://gist.github.com/mjhea0/0a6b0bb6cc7557776ab8">game runner</a> before submitting.</em></p>

<p>To submit your script, just email us a link to a secret Gist – <em>info (at) realpython (dot) com</em>. Good luck!</p>
