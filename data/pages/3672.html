<span>I previously posted about a wonderful education program utilizing Raspberry Pis</span><span> (</span><a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2015/02/raspbery-pis-in-space-astropi.html">AstroPi</a><span>)</span><span>. Here’s another one:</span></div>
<div><p>
Since last May, Unicef has been using Raspberry Pis to educate Syrian children who have been displaced into Lebanon due to their country’s civil war. The program, called </p><em>Pi4Learning</em><p> was developed by </p><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/tag/james-cranwell-ward/">James Cranwell-Ward</a><p>, UNICEF Lebanon Innovation Lead, and </p><a href="http://www.iearn.org/country/iearn-lebanon">Eliane Metni</a><p> of the International Education Association.</p></div>
<div><p>
With approximately 300,000 Syrian school children living as refugees in Lebanon with no educational resources, Unicef’s Cranwell-Ward sought an inexpensive, ready-to-go solution that could be implemented in refugee camp environments. Already a Raspberry Pi enthusiast, he paired the device with Alex Eames' KickStarer funded </p><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/unicef-educate-syrian-children-in-lebanon/">HDMIPi screens</a><p>. Working with Eliane Metni, who had been piloting Raspberry Pis at </p><em>Dhour El Shweur Public Secondary School in Lebanon</em><p>, they obtained free Arabic language curriculum from Khan Academy and began providing free classes to the Syrian children.</p></div>
<p>
The <em>Pi4L</em> program is divided into learning tracks: Core Skills Modules for ages 6 – 12 (literacy, numeracy, and science, using Khan Academy content); Technology Applications for ages 5 – 18 (Learning to Code and Coding to Learn); and Continuing Education and Certification for Teachers. </p>
<p>
Each complete computer system costs around $100 and the Khan Academy content is stored and can be delivered offline. Currently approximately 30,000 refugees are using the program, and the goal is to continue to expand.</p>
<div><p>
Both Cranwell-Ward and Metni are especially excited that the program teaches kids to code and to become creative participants in an increasingly technological world community. According to Cranwell-Ward, </p><em>“The rate at which tech is being rolled out into our lives is phenomenal and coding - or the understanding of technology and how to manipulate it - is going to be a core component of our lives and our children’s lives moving forward… . “There needs to be some basic understanding of what technology is, how it can be manipulated, how we can use it to help ourselves, and not just be a consumer or slave,”</em><p> quoted from the </p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/26/syria-children-learn-to-code-raspberry-pi">The Guardian</a><p>.</p></div>
<div><p>
One of the students is 11-year-old Zeinab Al Jusuf. There is a video about her experiences and the Unicef project at </p><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/non-formal-learning-for-syrian-refugees/">Unicef stories</a><p>. </p></div>
<div><p>
There is also a wealth of information online about this project, so if you’re at all interested I urge you to read more. For an excellent overview by Unicef’s Luciano Calestini, see </p><a href="http://www.fmreview.org/en/innovation/calestini.pdf">Innovation</a><p>. </p></div>
