   <p>
    There are two related, but distinct rationales for the proposal in this
PEP. The first relates to the experience of new users, while the second
relates to better enabling the evolution of the broader Python packaging
ecosystem.
   </p>
   <div class="section" id="improving-the-new-user-experience">
    
    <p>
     Currently, on systems without a platform package manager and repository,
installing a third-party Python package into a freshly installed Python
requires first identifying an appropriate package manager and then
installing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even on systems that
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     have a platform package manager, it is unlikely to
include every package that is available on the Python Package Index, and
even when a desired third-party package is available, the correct name in
the platform package manager may not be clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     This means that, to work effectively with the Python Package Index
ecosystem, users must know which package manager to install, where to get
it, and how to install it. The effect of this is that third-party Python
projects are currently required to choose from a variety of undesirable
alternatives:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple">
     <li>
      Assume the user already has a suitable cross-platform package manager
installed.
     </li>
     <li>
      Duplicate the instructions and tell their users how to install the
package manager.
     </li>
     <li>
      Completely forgo the use of dependencies to ease installation concerns
for their users.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     All of these available options have significant drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     If a project simply assumes a user already has the tooling then beginning
users may get a confusing error message when the installation command
doesn't work. Some operating systems may ease this pain by providing a
global hook that looks for commands that don't exist and suggest an OS
package they can install to make the command work, but that only works
on systems with platform package managers that include a package that
provides the relevant cross-platform installer command (such as many major
Linux distributions). No such assistance is available for Windows and
Mac OS X users, or more conservative Linux distributions. The challenges
of dealing with this problem for beginners (who are often also completely
new to programming, the use of command line tools and editing system
environment variables) are a regular feature of feedback the core Python
developers receive from professional educators and others introducing new
users to Python.
    </p>
    <p>
     If a project chooses to duplicate the installation instructions and tell
their users how to install the package manager before telling them how to
install their own project then whenever these instructions need updates
they need updating by every project that has duplicated them. This is
particular problematic when there are multiple competing installation
tools available, and different projects recommend different tools.
    </p>
    <p>
     This specific problem can be partially alleviated by strongly promoting
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     as the default installer and recommending that other projects
reference
     <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html">
      pip's own bootstrapping instructions
     </a>
     rather than
duplicating them. However the user experience created by this approach
still isn't particularly good (although there is an effort under way to
create a combined Windows installer for
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     and its dependencies that
should improve matters on that platform, and Mac OS X and *nix platforms
generally have
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      wget
     </tt>
     and hence the ability to easily download and run the
bootstrap scripts from the command line).
    </p>
    <p>
     The projects that have decided to forgo dependencies altogether are forced
to either duplicate the efforts of other projects by inventing their own
solutions to problems or are required to simply include the other projects
in their own source trees. Both of these options present their own problems
either in duplicating maintenance work across the ecosystem or potentially
leaving users vulnerable to security issues because the included code or
duplicated efforts are not automatically updated when upstream releases a new
version.
    </p>
    <p>
     By officially recommending and providing by default a specific cross-platform
package manager it will be easier for users trying to install these
third-party packages as well as easier for the people distributing them as
they should now be able to safely assume that most users will have the
appropriate installation tools available (or access to clear instructions on
how to obtain them). This is expected to become more important in the future
as the
     <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/">
      Wheel
     </a>
     <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id18">
      [17]
     </a>
     package format (deliberately) does not have a built in
"installer" in the form of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      setup.py
     </tt>
     so users wishing to install
from a wheel file will want an installer even in the simplest cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reducing the burden of actually installing a third-party package should
also decrease the pressure to add every useful module to the standard
library. This will allow additions to the standard library to focus more
on why Python should have a particular tool out of the box, and why it
is reasonable for that package to adopt the standard library's 18-24 month
feature release cycle, instead of using the general difficulty of installing
third-party packages as justification for inclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Providing a standard installation system also helps with bootstrapping
alternate build and installer systems, such as
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      zc.buildout
     </tt>
     ,
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      hashdist
     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      conda
     </tt>
     . So long as
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip install &lt;tool&gt;
     </tt>
     works, then a standard
Python-specific installer provides a reasonably secure, cross platform
mechanism to get access to these utilities.

   </div>
   <div class="section" id="enabling-the-evolution-of-the-broader-python-packaging-ecosystem">
    
    <p>
     As no new packaging standard can achieve widespread adoption without a
transition strategy that covers the versions of Python that are in
widespread
     <em>
      current
     </em>
     use (rather than merely future versions, like most
language features), the change proposed in this PEP is considered a
necessary step in the evolution of the Python packaging ecosystem
    </p>
    <p>
     The broader community has embraced the Python Package Index as a mechanism
for distributing and installing Python software, but the different concerns
of language evolution and secure software distribution mean that a faster
feature release cycle that encompasses older versions is needed to properly
support the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition, the core CPython development team have the luxury of
dropping support for earlier Python versions well before the rest of the
community, as downstream commercial redistributors pick up the task of
providing support for those versions to users that still need it, while
many third party libraries maintain compatibility with those versions as
long as they remain in widespread use.
    </p>
    <p>
     This means that the current
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      setup.py install
     </tt>
     based model for package
installation poses serious difficulties for the development and adoption
of new packaging standards, as, depending on how a project writes their
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      setup.py
     </tt>
     file, the installation command (along with other operations)
may end up invoking the standard library's
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      distutils
     </tt>
     package.
    </p>
    <p>
     As an indicator of how this may cause problems for the broader ecosystem,
consider that the feature set of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      distutils
     </tt>
     in Python 2.6 was frozen
in June 2008 (with the release of Python 2.6b1), while the feature set of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      distutils
     </tt>
     in Python 2.7 was frozen in April 2010 (with the release of
Python 2.7b1).
    </p>
    <p>
     By contrast, using a separate installer application like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     (which
ensures that even
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      setup.py
     </tt>
     files that invoke
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      distutils
     </tt>
     directly
still support the new packaging standards) makes it possible to support
new packaging standards in older versions of Python, just by upgrading
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     (which receives new feature releases roughly every 6 months). The
situation on older versions of Python is further improved by making it
easier for end users to install and upgrade newer build systems like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      setuptools
     </tt>
     or improved PyPI upload utilities like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      twine
     </tt>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not coincidental that this proposed model of using a separate installer
program with more metadata heavy and less active distribution formats matches
that used by most operating systems (including Windows since the introduction
of the installer service and the MSI file format), as well as many other
language specific installers.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Python 2.6, this compatibility issue is largely limited to various
enterprise Linux distributions (and their downstream derivatives). These
distributions often have even slower update cycles than CPython, so they
offer full support for versions of Python that are considered "security
fix only" versions upstream (and sometimes may even be to the point where
the core development team no longer support them at all - you can still get
commercial support for Python 2.3 if you really need it!).
    </p>
    <p>
     In practice, the fact that tools like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      wget
     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      curl
     </tt>
     are readily
available on Linux systems, that most users of Python on Linux are
already familiar with the command line, and that most Linux distributions
ship with a default configuration that makes running Python scripts easy,
means that the existing
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     bootstrapping instructions for any *nix
system are already quite straightforward. Even if
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     isn't provided by
the system package manager, then using
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      wget
     </tt>
     or
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      curl
     </tt>
     to retrieve the
bootstrap script from www.pip-installer.org and then running it is just a
couple of shell commands that can easily be copied and pasted as necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Accordingly, for any version of Python on any *nix system, the need to
bootstrap
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     in older versions isn't considered a major barrier to
adoption of new packaging standards, since it's just one more small
speedbump encountered by users of these long term stable releases. For
*nix systems, this PEP's formal endorsement of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     as the preferred
default packaging tool is seen as more important than the underlying
technical details involved in making
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     available by default, since
it shifts the nature of the conversation between the developers of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     and downstream repackagers of both
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     and CPython.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Python 2.7, on the other hand, the compatibility issue for adopting new
metadata standards is far more widespread, as it affects the python.org
binary installers for Windows and Mac OS X, as well as even relatively
fast moving *nix platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, and unlike Python 2.6, Python 2.7 is still a fully supported
upstream version, and will remain so until the release of Python 2.7.9
(currently scheduled for May 2015), at which time it is expected to enter
the usual "security fix only" mode. That means there are at least another
19 months where Python 2.7 is a deployment target for Python applications
that enjoys full upstream support. Even after the core development team
switches 2.7 to security release only mode in 2015, Python 2.7 will likely
remain a commercially supported legacy target out beyond 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Python 3 already presents a compelling alternative over Python 2 for
     <em>
      new
     </em>
     Python applications and deployments without an existing investment
in Python 2 and without a dependency on specific Python 2 only third party
modules (a set which is getting ever smaller over time), it is going to take
longer to create compelling business cases to update existing Python 2.7
based infrastructure to Python 3, especially in situations where the culture
of automated testing is weak (or nonexistent), making it difficult to
effectively use the available migration utilities.
    </p>
    <p>
     While this PEP only proposes documentation changes for Python 2.7, once
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     has a Windows installer available, a separate PEP will be created
and submitted proposing the creation and distribution of aggregate installers
for future CPython 2.7 maintenance releases that combine the CPython,
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     and Python Launcher for Windows installers into a single download
(the separate downloads would still remain available - the aggregate
installers would be provided as a convenience, and as a clear indication
of the recommended operating environment for Python in Windows systems).
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="section" id="why-pip">
    
    <p>
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     has been chosen as the preferred default installer, as it is an
already popular tool that addresses several design and user experience
issues with its predecessor
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      easy_install
     </tt>
     (these issues can't readily
be fixed in
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      easy_install
     </tt>
     itself due to backwards compatibility
concerns).
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     is also well suited to working within the bounds of
a single Python runtime installation (including associated virtual
environments), which is a desirable feature for a tool bundled with CPython.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other tools like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      zc.buildout
     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      conda
     </tt>
     are more ambitious in their
aims (and hence substantially better than
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     at handling external
binary dependencies), so it makes sense for the Python ecosystem to treat
them more like platform package managers to interoperate with rather than
as the default cross-platform installation tool. This relationship is
similar to that between
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     and platform package management systems
like
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      apt
     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      yum
     </tt>
     (which are also designed to handle arbitrary
binary dependencies).
    </p>
   </div>
  </div>
  <div class="section" id="proposal-overview">
   
   <p>
    This PEP proposes that the
    <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/3/install">
     Installing Python Modules
    </a>
    guide be
updated to officially recommend the use of
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    as the default
installer for Python packages, rather than the current approach of
recommending the direct invocation of the
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     setup.py install
    </tt>
    command.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, to avoid recommending a tool that CPython does not provide, it is
further proposed that the
    <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pip-installer.org">
     pip
    </a>
    <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id20" id="id21">

    </a>
    package manager be made available by
default when installing CPython 3.4 or later and when creating virtual
environments using the standard library's
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     venv
    </tt>
    module via the
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pyvenv
    </tt>
    command line utility.
   </p>
   <p>
    To support that end, this PEP proposes the inclusion of an
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     ensurepip
    </tt>
    bootstrapping module in Python 3.4, as well as automatic invocation of that
module from
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pyvenv
    </tt>
    and changes to the way Python installed scripts are
handled on Windows. Using a bootstrap module rather than providing
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    directly helps to clearly demarcate development responsibilities, and to
avoid inadvertently downgrading
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    when updating CPython.
   </p>
   <p>
    To provide clear guidance for new users of Python that may not be
starting with the latest release, this PEP also proposes that the
"Installing Python Modules" guides in Python 2.7 and 3.3 be updated to
recommend installing and using
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    , rather than invoking
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     distutils
    </tt>
    directly. It does
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    propose backporting any of the code changes that
are being proposed for Python 3.4.
   </p>
   <p>
    Finally, the PEP also strongly recommends that CPython redistributors and
other Python implementations ensure that
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    is available by default, or
at the very least, explicitly document the fact that it is not included.
   </p>
   <p>
    This PEP does
    <em>
     not
    </em>
    propose making pip (or any dependencies) directly
available as part of the standard library. Instead, pip will be a
bundled application provided along with CPython for the convenience
of Python users, but subject to its own development life cycle and able
to be upgraded independently of the core interpreter and standard library.

  <div class="section" id="explicit-bootstrapping-mechanism">
   
   <p>
    An additional module called

appropriate location (most commonly site-packages). It will expose a
callable named
    <tt class="docutils literal">

      <span class="pre">
       get-pip.py

     bootstrap script demonstrates an earlier variation of the
general concept, but the standard library version would take advantage of
the improved distribution capabilities offered by the CPython installers
to include private copies of

      pip
     </tt>
     and
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      setuptools

     as wheel files
(rather than as embedded base64 encoded data), and would not try to
contact PyPI (instead installing directly from the private wheel files).

    <p>
     Rather than including separate code to handle the bootstrapping, the
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     <tt class="docutils literal">

     The proposed CLI is based on a subset of the existing
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     options:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
Usage:
  python -m ensurepip [options]

General Options:
  -h, --help          Show help.
  -v, --verbose       Give more output. Option is additive, and can be used up to 3 times.
  -V, --version       Show the pip version that would be extracted and exit.
  -q, --quiet         Give less output.

Installation Options:
  -U, --upgrade       Upgrade pip and dependencies, even if already installed
  --user              Install using the user scheme.
  --root &lt;dir&gt;        Install everything relative to this alternate root directory.

     In most cases, end users won't need to use this CLI directly, as
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip

     should have been installed automatically when installing Python or when
creating a virtual environment. However, it is formally documented as a
public interface to support at least these known use cases:
    </p>
    <ul class="simple">
     <li>
      Windows and Mac OS X installations where the "Install pip" option was
      <em>
       not

      chosen during installation
     </li>
     <li>
      any installation where the user previously ran "pip uninstall pip"

     Users that want to retrieve the latest version from PyPI, or otherwise
need more flexibility, can then invoke the extracted

     appropriately.

    <p>
     The proposed
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      ensurepip

     module API consists of the following two
functions:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
def version():

    Returns a string specifying the bundled version of pip.
    """

def bootstrap(root=None, upgrade=False, user=False, verbosity=0):

    <ul class="simple">
     <li>
      Install pip (the default Python package management utility)?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     This option will be checked by default.

    <p>
     If the option is checked, then the installer will invoke the following
command with the just installed Python:
    </p>
    <pre class="literal-block">
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
</pre>
    <p>
     This ensures that, by default, installing or updating CPython will ensure
that the installed version of pip is at least as recent as the one included
with that version of CPython. If a newer version of pip has already been
installed then
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     <tt class="docutils literal">
      make altinstall

     commands of the source
distribution. The directory settings in the
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     module should
ensure the
     <tt class="docutils literal">

     components are automatically installed to the expected
locations.
    </p>
    <p>

     itself (including the private copy of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip

     and its
dependencies) will always be installed normally (as it is a regular
part of the standard library), but an option will be provided to skip
the invocation of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      ensurepip
     </tt>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     This means that even installing from source will provide
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     by default,
but redistributors provide
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     by other means (or not providing it at
all) will still be able to opt out of installing it using

   <div class="section" id="changes-to-virtual-environments">
    
    <p>
     Python 3.3 included a standard library approach to virtual Python environments
through the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      venv
     </tt>
     module. Since its release it has become clear that very
few users have been willing to use this feature directly, in part due to the
lack of an installer present by default inside of the virtual environment.
They have instead opted to continue using the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      virtualenv
     </tt>
     package which
     <em>
      does
     </em>
     include pip installed by default.
    </p>
    <p>
     To make the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      venv
     </tt>
     more useful to users it will be modified to issue the
pip bootstrap by default inside of the new environment while creating it. This
will allow people the same convenience inside of the virtual environment as
this PEP provides outside of it as well as bringing the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      venv
     </tt>
     module closer
to feature parity with the external
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      virtualenv
     </tt>
     package, making it a more
suitable replacement.
    </p>
    <p>
     To handle cases where a user does not wish to have pip bootstrapped into
their virtual environment a
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      <span class="pre">
       --without-pip

     APIs will be updated to accept
one new parameter:
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      with_pip
     </tt>
     (defaulting to
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      False
     </tt>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     The new default for the module API is chosen for backwards compatibility
with the current behaviour (as it is assumed that most invocation of the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      venv
     </tt>
     module happens through third part tools that likely will not
want
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     installed without explicitly requesting it), while the
default for the command line interface is chosen to try to ensure
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     is available in most virtual environments without additional action on the
part of the end user.
    </p>

third-party
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      virtualenv

     project will still be needed to obtain a
consistent cross-version experience in Python 3.3 and 2.7.

     The "Installing Python Modules" section of the standard library

the use of the

    While the Windows installer was updated in Python 3.3 to optionally

    <tt class="docutils literal">

works because Python 3.3 provides the Python Launcher for

    For Python 2.7 and 3.2, the most reliable mechanism will be to install the
Python Launcher for Windows using the standalone installer and then use
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     py
     <span class="pre">
      -m
     </span>
     pip
    </tt>
    as noted above.
   </p>
   <p>
    Adding the scripts directory to the system PATH will mean that
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    works reliably in the "only one Python installation on the system PATH"
case, with
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     py
     <span class="pre">
      -m
     </span>
     pip
    </tt>
    ,
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pipX
    </tt>
    , or
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pipX.Y
    </tt>
    needed only to select a
non-default version in the parallel installation case (and outside a virtual
environment). This change should also make the
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pyvenv
    </tt>
    command substantially
easier to invoke on Windows, along with all scripts installed by
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    ,
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     easy_install
    </tt>
    and similar tools.
   </p>
   <p>
    While the script invocations on recent versions of Python will run through
the Python launcher for Windows, this shouldn't cause any issues, as long
as the Python files in the Scripts directory correctly specify a Python version
in their shebang line or have an adjacent Windows executable (as
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     easy_install
    </tt>
    and
    <tt class="docutils literal">
     pip
    </tt>
    do).

     Earlier versions of this PEP proposed changing the name of the script
installation directory on Windows from "Scripts" to "bin" in order to
improve the cross-platform consistency of the virtual environments created
by
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pyvenv

     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However, Paul Moore determined that this change was likely backwards
incompatible with cross-version Windows installers created with previous
versions of Python, so the change has been removed from this PEP

     Earlier versions of this PEP made the case that the challenges of getting
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     bootstrapped for new users posed a significant enough barrier to
Python's future growth that it justified adding
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      ensurepip
     </tt>
     as a new
feature in the upcoming Python 2.7 and 3.3 maintenance releases.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the proposal to provide
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     with Python 3.4 was universally
popular, this part of the proposal was highly controversial and ultimately

     Accordingly, the proposal to backport

has been removed from this PEP in favour of creating a Windows installer
for
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip

     and a possible future PEP suggesting creation of an aggregate
installer for Python 2.7 that combines CPython 2.7,

Launcher for Windows.

     , the predecessor for this PEP, proposes its own solution. Its
solution involves shipping a fake
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     command that when executed would
implicitly bootstrap and install pip if it does not already exist. This has
been rejected because it is too "magical". It hides from the end user when
exactly the pip command will be installed or that it is being installed at
all. It also does not provide any recommendations or considerations towards
downstream packagers who wish to manage the globally installed pip through
the mechanisms typical for their system.
    </p>
    <p>
     The implicit bootstrap mechanism also ran into possible permissions issues,
if a user inadvertently attempted to bootstrap pip without write access to
the appropriate installation directories.

   </div>
   <div class="section" id="including-pip-directly-in-the-standard-library">
    
    <p>
     Similar to this PEP is the proposal of just including pip in the standard
library. This would ensure that Python always includes pip and fixes all of the
end user facing problems with not having pip present by default. This has been
rejected because we've learned, through the inclusion and history of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      distutils
     </tt>
     in the standard library, that losing the ability to update the
packaging tools independently can leave the tooling in a state of constant
limbo. Making it unable to ever reasonably evolve in a time frame that actually
affects users as any new features will not be available to the general
population for
     <em>
      years
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Allowing the packaging tools to progress separately from the Python release
and adoption schedules allows the improvements to be used by
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     members
of the Python community and not just those able to live on the bleeding edge
of Python releases.
    </p>
    <p>
     There have also been issues in the past with the "dual maintenance" problem
if a project continues to be maintained externally while
     <em>
      also
     </em>
     having a
fork maintained in the standard library. Since external maintenance of
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     will always be needed to support earlier Python versions, the
proposed bootstrapping mechanism will becoming the explicit responsibility
of the CPython core developers (assisted by the pip developers), while
pip issues reported to the CPython tracker will be migrated to the pip
issue tracker. There will no doubt still be some user confusion over which
tracker to use, but hopefully less than has been seen historically when
including complete public copies of third-party projects in the standard
library.
    </p>
    <p>
     The approach described in this PEP also avoids some technical issues
related to handling CPython maintenance updates when pip has been
independently updated to a more recent version. The proposed pip-based
bootstrapping mechanism handles that automatically, since pip and the
system installer never get into a fight about who owns the pip
installation (it is always managed through pip, either directly, or
indirectly via the
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      ensurepip
     </tt>
     bootstrap module).
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the separate bootstrapping step means it is also easy to avoid
installing
     <tt class="docutils literal">
      pip
     </tt>
     at all if end users so desire. This is often the case
if integrators are using system packages to handle installation of
components written in multiple languages using a common set of tools.

   <div class="section" id="defaulting-to-user-installation">
    
    <p>
     Some consideration was given to bootstrapping pip into the per-user
site-packages directory by default. However, this behavior would be
surprising (as it differs from the default behavior of pip itself)
and is also not currently considered reliable (there are some edge cases
which are not handled correctly when pip is installed into the user
site-packages directory rather than the system site-packages).
