    <p><em>A learning environment for Python programming suitable for beginners and children, inspired by Logo.</em></p>
    <p> </p>

  <p>PythonTurtle strives to provide the lowest-threshold way to learn (or teach) software development in the Python programming language. Students command an interactive Python shell (similar to the IDLE development environment) and use Python functions to move a turtle displayed on the screen. An illustrated help screen introduces the student to the basics of Python programming while demonstrating how to move the turtle.</p>
