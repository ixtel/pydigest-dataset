You've heard of the full-stack developer and full-stack Python, but this week Authentise is taking it to a new level with Python all the way from the cloud to the client to the printer. It's all about 3D printing with Python on episode 23 with Eli Ribble. You'll learn how Eli and his team are using Python to allow independent makers to sell their designs while retaining control over the IP and copyrights. Plus, you'll learn about the most common and the craziest thing that Eli has seen printed lately. <br/>

<span><a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/index.html" target="_blank">Understanding LSTM Networks</a></span><br/>
People are achieving remarkable results with RNNs. Essentially all of these are achieved using LSTMs. They really work a lot better for most tasks! Written down as a set of equations, LSTMs look pretty intimidating. Hopefully, walking through them step by step in this essay will make them a bit more approachable.<br/>

<span><a href="http://vknight.org/unpeudemath/code/2015/06/14/natural-language-and-predicting-funny/" target="_blank">Python, natural language processing and predicting funny</a></span> <br/>
Every year there is a big festival in Edinburgh called the fringe festival. I blogged about this a while ago, in that post I did a very basic bit of natural language processing aiming to try and identify what made things funny. In this post I'm going to push that a bit further by building a classification model that aims to predict if a joke is funny or not. There also an <a href="http://vknight.org/unpeudemath/code/2015/08/28/natural-language-processing-of-new-jokes-from-2015/" target="_blank">update</a> to this post with some more data from this year's Edinburgh Fringe festival.<br/>

<span><a href="http://jadianes.me/movie-recommender-ws/" target="_blank">A scalable on-line movie recommender using Spark and Flask</a></span><br/>
This Apache Spark tutorial will guide you step-by-step into how to use the MovieLens dataset to build a movie recommender using collaborative filtering with Spark's Alternating Least Saqures implementation. The tutorial is organised in two parts. The first one is about getting and parsing movies and ratings data into Spark RDDs. The second is about building and using the recommender and persisting it for later use in our on-line recommender system.<br/>
