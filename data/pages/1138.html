					<p>Hey all!</p>

<p>I've whipped up a neat little project as part of my 'django-easy' series: <a href="https://github.com/Miserlou/django-easy-api">Django-Easy-API</a>.</p>

<p>It's an incredibly easy method of adding serialization to any page of your Django app. Whereas the wonderful <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django-REST-Framework</a> provides everything you need to make a "complete" API for your site, it's fairly complicated and takes a good deal time to set up. <b>Django-Easy-API</b> has very a different philosophy: every page should be serializable, and it should be incredibly easy to set up.</p>

<p>That's why with <b>Django-Easy-API</b>, you can give your whole site an API with only a single line of code!</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>So, suppose you're running an online shop, if you have a page for an item which displays rendered HTML for a URL like this:</p>

<p>https://yoursite.xxx/item/42</p>

<p>Then with django-easy-api installed, to get a JSON-consumable of the page, you only need to go to: </p>

<p>https://yoursite.xxx/item/42?api=json</p>

<p>or, for XML:</p>

<p>https://yoursite.xxx/item/42?api=xml</p>

<p>The only thing you need to do is change a single import:</p>

<p/><pre># from django.shortcuts import render_to_response
from easy_api.shortcuts import render_to_response</pre>

<p>which will add this ability to all of your views, or, to just use it for a single view, use <b><i>easy_api.shortcuts.render_to_easy_api_response</i></b> instead of <b><i>django.shortcuts.render_to_response</i></b>.</p>

<h4>That's it!</h4>

<p>And that's all it takes to add a machine-consumable version of your site. It won't give you a "true API" (for that you'll want to look at the wonderful, albeit chunky, <a href="http://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django-REST-Framework</a>), but it'll give you everything you need to have a feed-able version of your site. This is great for feeding into other apps, or integrating with mobile applications, or piping to other services. </p>

</p><p>Enjoy!</p>
