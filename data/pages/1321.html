<ul>
<li>MultiThreading feature</li>
<li>Save-State-On-Exception feature</li>
</ul>

<p>do it yourself</p>

<p>It uses Find My Iphone service API, where bruteforce protection was not implemented. Password list was generated from top 500 RockYou leaked passwords, which satisfy appleID password policy. Before you start, make sure it's not illegal in your country. </p>
