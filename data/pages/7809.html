<p>An image reader for nd2 (NIS Elements) multidimensional images</p>








<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/soft-matter/pims_nd2" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/soft-matter/pims_nd2.png?branch=master"/></a></p>
<p><tt>pims_nd2</tt> contains a reader for nd2 files produced by NIS Elements.
The reader is based on the included <a href="http://www.nd2sdk.com" rel="nofollow">SDK</a> from
Nikon, which makes it compatible with older versions of nd2 files. The
reader is written in the <a href="https://github.com/soft-matter/pims" rel="nofollow">pims</a>
framework, enabling easy access to multidimensional files, lazy slicing,
and nice display in IPython.</p>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p><tt>pims_nd2</tt> is implemented on Windows, Linux and OSX systems. To obtain
the latest stable version, install via PyPi:</p>
<pre>pip install pims_nd2
</pre>
<p>The ND2 SDK binaries are included in the package and will be copied into
the <tt>pims_nd2</tt> package folder.</p>
</div>
<div id="dependencies">
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>This reader requires <a href="https://github.com/soft-matter/pims" rel="nofollow">pims</a>
version 0.3.0.</p>
</div>
<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following code opens a movie file and displays a frame. Note that
frames are only actually read when necessary:</p>
<pre>from pims import ND2_Reader
frames = ND2_Reader('some_movie.nd2')
frames[82]  # display frame 82
frames.close()
</pre>
<p>The following code opens the multidimensional demo file included in the
package and iterates through the first 3 frames. Note that we use a
context manager here. We tell the reader which axis to iterate over and
which axes to include in one frame. Also we select which channel to
read.</p>
<pre>from pims import ND2_Reader
with ND2_Reader('cluster.nd2') as frames:
    frames.iter_axes = 't'  # 't' is the default already
    frames.bundle_axes = 'zyx'  # when 'z' is available, this will be default
    frames.default_coords['c'] = 1  # 0 is the default setting
    for frame in frames[:3]:
        # do something with 3D frames in channel 1
</pre>
<p>The best way to use the reader is using a context manager. If you do not
use a context manager, make sure to call <tt>frames.close()</tt> at the end
of your script.</p>
<p>Metadata access can be done on two levels: reader level and frame level.</p>
<pre>frames.metadata['mpp']  # calibration in microns per pixel
frames[0].metadata['t_ms']  # time of frame in milliseconds
</pre>
