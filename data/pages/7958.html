I wasn’t planning anything in particular with my powerful calculator/language hybrid, but at some point people from Erlang Factory asked me if I wanted to give a talk about my language and of course I said yes, then I got a dose of impostor syndrome, so I started the project from scratch to do a proper programming language and I decided to support every feature that Erlang supports and not much more.

I just had got my Engineers degree and had a new job so development stopped for a while, then Elixir appeared and got much more attention, so I thought “OK, someone got it right, I will just stop pushing efene” and some years passed. But then looking into Elixir I saw that the Elixir ideas weren’t exactly the ideas of efene and I decided to rewrite it to try to fill the niche of “just a different syntax for Erlang, reuse as much as possible from the Erlang ecosystem, unified tooling and documentation as the core of the project”. The language has been complete for a while now. I’m just working on documentation, rebar3 plugins andwaiting for some of the surrounding tools to mature to avoid having to redo the documentation (mainly <a href="https://github.com/rebar/rebar3" data-href="https://github.com/rebar/rebar3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">rebar3</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGuAXS0Cy_8" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGuAXS0Cy_8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">cowboy 2</a>).</p><p name="1182" id="1182" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why do you embrace the </strong><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" data-href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Zen of Python</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">?</strong></p><figure name="056d" id="056d" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Zen of Python</figcaption></figure><p name="8b5e" id="8b5e" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Python was the first language I enjoyed coding in before I coded in C, C++, ASM and Java, but just because it was what I knew or they provided something I needed.
