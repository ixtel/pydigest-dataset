<p>With wxPython (latest) installed on OS X Lion, an attempt to <code>import wx</code> in the interpreter results in:</p>

<pre><code>  File "wx/__init__.pyc", line 45, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "wx/_core.pyc", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "wx/_core_.pyc", line 18, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "wx/_core_.pyc", line 11, in __load
ImportError: /Users/Pyderman/Downloads/e30356784638/dist/Program.app/Contents/Resources/lib/python2.6/lib-dynload/wx/_core_.so: no appropriate 64-bit architecture
</code></pre>

<p>So following the instructions given by <code>man python</code>, I set:</p>

<pre><code>export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes
</code></pre>

<p>and then the import of wx works (in the interpreter). Yet when I bundle the program into an OS X app using <em>py2app</em>, the error re-occurs, even though I am trying to launch the app within the same terminal where I have set the environment variable to prefer 32 bit. </p>

<p>I'm guessing that somehow py2app doesn't "know" that 32-bit is preferred? But how so, and how can this be enforced or controlled?</p>
