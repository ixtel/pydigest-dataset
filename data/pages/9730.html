<p>RWT (Run With This) provides on-demand dependency resolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows declaration of dependencies at runtime.</li>
<li>Downloads missing dependencies and makes their packages available for import.</li>
<li>Installs packages to a special staging location such that they’re not installed after the process exits.</li>
<li>Keeps a cache of such packages for reuse.</li>
<li>Supersedes installed packages when required.</li>
<li>Re-uses the pip tool chain for package installation and pkg_resources for working set management.</li>
</ul>
<p>RWT is not intended to solve production dependency management, but does aim to address the other, one-off scenarios around dependency management:</p>
<ul>
<li>build setup</li>
<li>test runners</li>
<li>just in time script running</li>
<li>interactive development</li>
</ul>
<p>RWT is a compliment to Pip and Virtualenv and Setuptools, intended to more
readily address the on-demand needs and supersede some
features like <tt>setup_requires</tt>.</p>

<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li>as script launcher</li>
<li>as runtime dependency context manager</li>
<li>as interactive interpreter in dependency context</li>
<li>as module launcher (akin to <cite>python -m</cite>)</li>
</ul>

<div id="examples">
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The <tt>examples</tt> folder in this project includes some examples demonstrating
the power and usefulness of the project. Read the docs on those examples
for instructions.</p>
</div>
<div id="versioning">
<h2>Versioning</h2>
<p>RWT uses semver, so you can use this library with
confidence about the stability of the interface, even
during periods of great flux.</p>
</div>
<div id="testing">
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Invoke tests with <tt>setup.py test</tt>.</p>
