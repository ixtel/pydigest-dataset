                    <p>This is Part II in a series of blog posts about <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US 2013</a>. The goal is to provide a handy reference guide for first time attendees of the world's largest <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> conference. <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html">Part I</a> was mostly about <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/">tutorials</a>, this post will be about registration and the first day of talks.</p>
<div class="section" id="registration">
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>If you haven't done so yet, please <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/">register</a> now. Last year PyCon sold out way in advance, and hundreds missed the event. Which is a shame, because the conference is awesome!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the money you spend on registration will go towards a very good thing. You see, after the costs for running PyCon are subtracted, the rest will go to the non-profit Python Software Foundation (<a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/psf/">PSF</a>). In addition to supporting the Python language itself, the PSF provides financial aid and grants for aspiring developers around the world. Which means the money you spend registering for PyCon will literally change people's lives. This isn't an idle exaggeration, this outreach has made a difference for you, me, and arguably the world. I would love to say more, but that's an article for another day...</p>
<p>Alright, on to the talks!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="talk-attendance-guidelines">
<h2>Talk Attendance Guidelines</h2>
<p>At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some quick guidelines:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Ask Questions!</strong> If the speaker leaves time for questions at the end, <a class="reference external" href="http://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/">go and ask</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.</strong> It's disconcerting to give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning them off to look at the speaker.</li>
<li><strong>Don't Heckle.</strong> It's nerve wracking going up in front of hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video. Heckling is <strong>never</strong> funny and it's a good way to lose friends and make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the talk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, that out of the way, let's take a look at what Friday, March 15th, has to offer in terms of beginner friendly talks...</p>
<div class="section" id="friday-morning">
<h3>Friday Morning</h3>
<p>The registration desk opens at 7:00 AM. Breakfast begins at 8:00 AM. From 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM is the welcome and initial keynote speeches. PyCon keynotes aren't boring - <strong>they are crazy awesome!</strong>.</p>
<p>In selecting these talks, I've tried to focus on the more technical ones.</p>

<h3>Friday Lunch</h3>
<p>Quick notes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Don't forget to keep your PyCon meal tickets you got when you registered in the morning or they won't let you into the lunch room!</li>
<li>Sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every time I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get to meet <strong>amazing</strong> people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and you'll never get to know any of them unless you try.</li>
