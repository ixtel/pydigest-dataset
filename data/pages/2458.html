<span><a href="http://danielnouri.org/notes/2014/12/17/using-convolutional-neural-nets-to-detect-facial-keypoints-tutorial/" target="_blank">Using convolutional neural nets to detect facial keypoints tutorial</a></span><br/>
This is a hands-on tutorial on deep learning. Step by step, we'll go about building a solution for the Facial Keypoint Detection Kaggle challenge. The tutorial introduces Lasagne, a new library for building neural networks with Python and Theano. We'll use Lasagne to implement a couple of network architectures, talk about data augmentation, dropout, the importance of momentum, and pre-training. Some of these methods will help us improve our results quite a bit.<br/>

<span><a href="http://vimeo.com/114700985" target="_blank">Augmenting Binary Analysis with Python and Pin</a></span><br/>
Reverse engineering typically involves activities ranging from reading disassembly output to playing with debuggers. However, an often overlooked technique is making use of dynamic binary analysis frameworks. In this talk, we will be looking at Intel's solution, PIN, and walk through how just about anyone can make great use of it. We will discuss reasons why more people should use these tools, some novel uses (including finding bugs and solving ctf challenges automatically), and even introduce our own python bindings for Pin which will make writing pin tools a breeze. <br/>

<span><a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2014/12/15/real-time-barcode-detection-video-python-opencv/" target="_blank">Real-time barcode detection in video with Python and OpenCV</a></span><br/>
In the previous post we explored how to detect and find barcodes in images. In this post, we are going to refactor the code to detect barcodes in video.<br/>

<span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/11/making-a-text-adventure-game-with-the-cmd-and-textwrap-python-modules/" target="_blank">Making a Text Adventure Game with the cmd and textwrap Python Modules</a></span><br/>
Text adventures are easyto make because they don't require graphics. This tutorial uses two Python modules, cmd and textwrap and makes minimal use of object-oriented programming, but you don't have to know OOP concepts to follow. (But in general, text adventures would do very well with an object-oriented approach.) This tutorial is for beginner Python 3 programmers.<br/>

<span><a href="https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/top-mistakes-python-big-data-analytics" target="_blank">The Top Mistakes Developers Make When Using Python for Big Data Analytics</a></span><br/>
This article covers the most common time wasters encountered when working with Python and Big Data and provide suggestions to get back on track and spend time on what really matters: using creativity and scientific methods to generate insights from vast amounts and diverse types of data.<br/>

<span><a href="http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/17/programming-a-bot-to-play-the-sushi-go-round-flash-game/" target="_blank">Programming a Bot to Play the "Sushi Go Round" Flash Game</a></span><br/>
This tutorial teaches how to write a bot that can automatically play the Flash game Sushi Go Round. The concepts in this tutorial can be applied to make bots that play other games as well. <br/>

<span><a href="http://moderndata.plot.ly/graph-data-from-mysql-database-in-python/" target="_blank">Graph data from MySQL database in Python</a></span><br/>
Reading data from a MySQL database and graphing it in Python is straightforward, and all the tools that you need are free and online. This post shows you how. <br/>

<span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/178398340X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=178398340X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pythonweekly-20&amp;linkId=U7QSB6JNEAPKIJZW" target="_blank">Flask Framework Cookbook</a></span> <br/>
Flask Framework Cookbook takes you through a number of recipes that will help you understand the power of Flask and its extensions. You will start by seeing the different ways of configurations that a Flask application can make use of. You will learn how to work with templates and learn about the ORM and view layers. You will see how to write an admin interface followed by the debugging and logging of errors. Finally, you will learn about different deployment and post-deployment techniques on platforms such as Apache, Tornado, and Heroku.<br/>

<strong><span><span><span>Interesting Projects, Tools and Libraries</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://nuitka.net/" target="_blank">Nuitka</a></span> <br/>
Nuitka is the Python compiler. It is a good replacement for the Python interpreter and compiles every construct that CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 have. It then executed uncompiled code, and compiled code together in an extremely compatible manner. You can use all Python library modules or and all extension modules freely. It translates the Python into a C level program that then uses "libpython" to execute in the same way as CPython does. Any optimization is aimed at avoiding overhead, where it's unnecessary. None is aimed at removing compatibility, although there is an "improved" mode, where not every bug of standard Python is emulated.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/i2y/mochi" target="_blank">Mochi</a></span><br/>
Mochi is a dynamically typed programming language for functional programming and actor-style programming. Its interpreter is written in Python3. The interpreter translates a program written in Mochi to Python3's AST / bytecode.<br/>
