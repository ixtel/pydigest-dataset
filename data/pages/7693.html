<br/>
<span><a href="https://community.nitrous.io/tutorials/asynchronous-programming-with-python-3" target="_blank">Asynchronous Programming with Python 3</a></span><br/>
Python 3.5 introduced the new keywords, async and await to Python. This change solidifies a strong commitment towards writing asynchronous programs in Python. Before in Python 3.4, we needed to use parts of the standard library (using the decorator asyncio.coroutine). So, what does this all mean? In this tutorial, we are going to try and answer that question.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/34/continuum-scientific-python-and-the-business-of-open-source" target="_blank">Episode #34: Continuum: Scientific Python and The Business of Open Source</a></span><br/>
What if you built a product that dramatically improved how hundreds of free, open source Python libraries worked together, gave it to the world for free, and then built a thriving business on it? It's the open-source dream really, isn't it? In this episode, we talk with Travis Oliphant from Continuum who did exactly that! <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries/" target="_blank">Comparing 7 Python data visualization tools</a></span><br/>
In this post, we'll use a real-world dataset, and use each of these 7 libraries to make visualizations. As we do that, we'll discover what areas each library is best in, and how to leverage the Python data visualization ecosystem most effectively.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://tech.adroll.com/blog/dev/2015/11/16/count-things-with-aws-lambda-python-and-dynamodb.html" target="_blank">Build a simple distributed system using AWS Lambda, Python, and DynamoDB</a></span><br/>

<span><a href="http://podcastinit.com/dariusz-suchojad-zato.html" target="_blank">Podcast.__init__ Episode 31 -  Dariusz Suchojad on Zato</a></span><br/>
Service integration platforms have traditionally been the realm of Java projects. Zato is a project that shows Python is a great choice for systems integration due to its flexibility and wealth of useful libraries. In this episode we had the opportunity to speak with Dariusz Suchojad, the creator of Zato about why he decided to make it and what makes it interesting. Listen to the episode and then take it for a spin.<br/>

<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmKM4ng44vk" target="_blank">Machine Learning with a Data-Unfriendly Stack</a></span><br/>
Stripe processes billions of dollars in payments a year on behalf of tens of thousands of businesses, using machine learning to detect and stop fraudulent transactions and fraudulent merchants. Our modeling workflow involves the typical "data science" tools: R and IPython for exploratory analysis, Hadoop for batch data processing, and scikit-learn for model building. However, Stripe's production backend is written in Ruby and uses MongoDB as its data store, and this has introduced difficulties for both model training and production scoring. In this talk, I'll describe the various choices we've made to bridge "main land" and "data land" and how, in the process, our model development process has gone from terrible to "ok."<br/>

<span><a href="https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2015/guide-to-python-profiling-cprofile-concrete-case-carbonara" target="_blank">Profiling Python using cProfile: a concrete case</a></span><br/>
Writing programs is fun, but making them fast can be a pain. Python programs are no exception to that, but the basic profiling toolchain is actually not that complicated to use. Here, I would like to show you how you can quickly profile and analyze your Python code to find what part of the code you should optimize.<br/>

<span><a href="https://github.com/markdregan/Bayesian-Modelling-in-Python" target="_blank">Bayesian Modelling in Python</a></span><br/>
A tutorial for those interested in learning how to apply bayesian modelling techniques in python (PYMC3). This tutorial doesn't aim to be a bayesian statistics tutorial - but rather a programming cookbook for those who understand the fundamental of bayesian statistics and want to learn how to build bayesian models using python. <br/>

<span><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3560" target="_blank">Webinar: Mutation Testing in Python</a></span><br/>
Mutation testing is a technique for systematically mutating source code in order to validate test suites. It makes small changes to a program's source code and then runs a test suite? if the test suite ever succeeds on mutated code then a flag is raised. I'll begin this presentation with a description of the theory behind mutation testing, and then I'll move into an analysis of Cosmic Ray, a tool for mutation testing in Python. While some of the details of this presentation will necessarily be Python­ specific, the concepts and lessons are broadly applicable and should be interesting to anyone involved in producing software.<br/>
