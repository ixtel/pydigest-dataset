<h2>Funding testimonial: Divio</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Daniele Procida, Adrienne Lowe</strong> on February 4, 2016 </span>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://divio.com/">Divio</a> is a flourishing international Python/Django development company.</p>
<p>Our success in software  is utterly dependent on a number of things, and our head of accounting was kind enough to put figures on some of them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>up-to-date workstations and software for our team of developers: <strong>US$100’000</strong></li>
<li>annual supply of coffee, tea and other refreshments: <strong>US$25’000</strong></li>
<li>being able to rely on a solid, stable, secure and powerful web application framework: <strong>priceless</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When we say our business is built on Django, we're not just talking about our web applications, we do literally mean our business. And almost unbelievably, Django, our stable rock, is <em>free</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Django, Divio was able to get started, and thanks to Django we've grown into a company with clients around the world, over 30 employees in four different countries, and a bright future.</p>
<p>Django was a bold choice in 2006, but Python/Django web development clearly had a bright future, even in those early days. We made the right judgement when we decided that Django’s power and reliability represented our future. Since then, the investment we made has been repaid many times over.</p>
<p>It's tempting to take Django for granted, but the fact is, we rely on it. What's more, we don't just need Django now, we need Django to <em>keep on</em> developing and improving too.</p>
<p><em>It really matters to us to support Django</em>. Helping fund the DSF's Fellowship Programme has been an excellent way to do that, and we've benefitted <em>directly</em> from the improvements to Django's codebase that the Fellowship has made possible.</p>
<p>Django isn’t just our chosen web application framework.</p>
<p>Django is  also a community of people and an ecosystem of skills and software. We need them too, so we also we fund and support:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the conferences (like DjangoCons, PyCons and others)</li>
<li>the projects (like Read the Docs)</li>
<li>the initiatives (like Django Girls)</li>
<li>… and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Funding Django is not an act of charity, it's an investment</strong>, and we do it because it's a way of securing our own future.</p>
<p>Every business that relies on Django is in the same position, and no doubt wants Django to remain solid and stable, secure and powerful, and priceless and free - so <strong>the only sensible thing to do is invest in it</strong>, by providing financial support to the Django Software Foundation and to its community.</p>
