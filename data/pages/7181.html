What does it mean to be a leader in the Python community? Contributing to open source? Speaking at conferences? Starting the largest user group? Writing a book? Being a core contributor? The answer is yes. And that's why Jessica McKellar won the Frank Willison Award for Contributions to the Python Community. She is the guest on this episode of Talk Python To Me. <br/>

<span><a href="http://blog.lerner.co.il/pythons-objects-and-classes-a-visual-guide/" target="_blank">Python's objects and classes -- a visual guide</a></span><br/>
This post walks you through some of the connections that we have among objects in Python, in the hopes that it'll help to cement some of the ideas that stem from this "everything is an object" idea. It'll also demonstrate some of the fun that happens when you're creating an object hierarchy, and how things can get a bit weird.<br/>

This week Pronto CycleShare, Seattle's Bicycle Share system, turned one year old. To celebrate this, Pronto made available a large cache of data from the first year of operation and announced the Pronto Cycle Share's Data Challenge, which offers prizes for different categories of analysis. In this post, I want to show how you can get started analyzing this data and joining it with other available data sources using the PyData stack, namely NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. <br/>

In this post, we'll group our Time magazine cover dataset into 10 groups -- one group for each of the 10 decades Time magazine has been in publication. Then, for each of these groups, we'll compute the average of all images in the group, giving us a single visual representation of how the Time cover images looked. This average image will allow us to identify visual trends in the cover images; specifically, marketing and advertising techniques used by Time during a given decade.<br/>

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the basic principles of machine learning, and how to get started with machine learning in Python. Luckily for us, Python has an amazing ecosystem of libraries that make machine learning easy to get started with. We'll be using the excellent Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries in this tutorial.<br/>

When testing your application, you'll often come across the need to test that your application behaves correct across a range of inputs or conditions. Instead of repetitively defining the same test scaffolding, let's use some meta-programming to build our tests methods from a list of parameters. Nose has support for Generator Tests, but they don't work with python's unittest framework. Let's walk-through how to build our own test generator that does.<br/>
