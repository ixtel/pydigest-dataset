<p>Don’t panic. This is not an announcement of my abandoning the project. <a href="http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> still has a long way to go, and I 100% intend to be working on getting it there.</p>
<p>What this <em>is</em> an announcement of is of my continued existence in a market economy and my tragic need to acquire currency in order to convert it into food and accommodation.</p>
<p>I haven’t been making a big deal of it, so some of you might be surprised to learn that the reason Hypothesis development has been so rapid for the last 6 months is that I’ve been working on it full time unpaid. It’s not so much that I took time off to write Hypothesis as that I had the time off anyway and I thought I’d do something useful with it. Hypothesis is that something useful.</p>
<p>I would <em>love</em> to continue working on Hypothesis full time. But the whole “unpaid” thing is starting to become not viable, and will become critically non-viable as soon as I move back to London.</p>
<p>So I’m going to need money.</p>
<p>I will do something more organised in the next month, but for now if you are a company or individual interested in paying me to do any of the following, I would very much like to hear from you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsored Hypothesis development (this can include paying for implementing specific features if you want)</li>
<li>Integration work getting Hypothesis to work well your testing environment</li>
<li>Training courses on how to use Hypothesis</li>
<li>Anything else Hypothesis related</li>
</ul>
<p>If the above sounds interesting, please email me at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aecacfd8c7caeecadcc3cfcdc7d8cbdc80cdc1c3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="335752455a577357415e52505a4556411d505c5e">[email protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>If no money to continue working on Hypothesis is forthcoming, Hypothesis development will absolutely continue, but at a greatly reduced rate. The current development cycle is approximately a minor version a week. This will likely go down to at most a minor version every month, more likely a minor version every two. This would be a shame, as I have a bunch of exciting features I still want to work on, and then I need to tie everything together into a coherent 2.0 release. With full time work I would project that to happen end of this year, without I can’t really make any predictions at the moment.</p>
