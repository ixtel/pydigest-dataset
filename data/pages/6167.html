<p>An extension library for selenium</p>








<p>This library is an extension library build on top of selenium.</p>
<p>It provided a bunch features that need in production enviroment but selenium
have not provide yet or won’t provided by design even in future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added force_xxx() series functions to invoke the element directly even the
element be covered by other elements. Just as force_click(), force_focus(),
etc…</li>
<li>Added force_get() method to webdriver, it will stop the page loading after
page loading timeout exception happen, so that the next script could just
run without break by that exception.</li>
<li>Added ability to set element’s attribute</li>
<li>Provided xpath_find(), xpath_find_all(), etc. For simply invoke xpath for
recursively find elements. it would iterate each frame and each window to
find your elements and do the actions without switch frame manually, that
could reduce a great lot jobs.</li>
<li>Provided some advance UI class to wrap for some third-parties editors ( Just
like TinyMCE )</li>
</ul>
