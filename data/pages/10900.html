Of course, this isn’t perfect, since they might be awake and <i>not</i> using Facebook (I know). Having spoken to a few people who were graphed, it’s been a fairly accurate measure of awake/asleep time, as well as “how much do you browse Facebook at work” time ;)

Give me a live graph to play with</h2><p><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.rawgit.com%2Fdefaultnamehere%2Fzzzzz%2F70d407736092304ee247fbbacbe9f82bc0cba472%2Ftemplates%2Fsample_graph.html&amp;t=MzNkMmJhNmExZTU1YjIyNjkxOWUxOWYxZmY5NmVkMmNhYjNjZDhjOSxZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">You got it, boss. Click here. Or anywhere, really. This whole sentence is a link.</a> </p><h2>What else can you do with this data?</h2><p>You can aggregate. Finding the average wake up time/sleep time/time spent on Facebook each day and then looking for outliers sure sounds like a way to find interesting things about your Facebook friends.</p><p>You can write a thing to email you every morning with the names and sleep times of everyone who’s had less than 6 hours of sleep.</p><p>You could even try and guess when your friends are talking to each other, by looking for times when only a few people are active, although I suspect this would be hard.</p><p>I’m sure you can come up with something else, too.</p><h2>Why can you do this? Can’t Facebook stop this from happening?</h2><p>That’s a good question, thanks for asking.</p><p>It makes sense for <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fnicememe.website&amp;t=YmQ4NDU0ZjA4ODMwYjY4OTUxZjEzZDNmM2ExOGY5ZTQwN2Y0N2VkNixZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">Facebook </a>to be able to do this, since they can tell when everyone is online anyway. But why can your <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmatmartinez.net%2Fnsfw%2F&amp;t=NjcxY2ZlMzc2OTg2NmM5NWMxZDg2NjhlY2I3NzAyZWFkYmQwYTVmNyxZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">Facebook </a>friends do this to you? </p><p>I don’t know all the details of how facebook.com uses all the data that’s sent via the /pull endpoint, but it’s kinda creepy that I can see my friends’ status on every device? I guess they could just give me “web” or “mobile” or “offline”, rather than the full list of statuses for every client, but even that doesn’t solve the problem.</p><p>I also see the value in seeing “last active 4h ago” and “last active 1m ago” for Messenger contacts but… I dunno, here I am making these creepy graphs. </p><p>Anyway, I just open-sourced my dodgy graph making thing so now everyone can do this. And who knows how many people have been doing it already?</p><p>I’m probably oversimplifying it, though. The smart people at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmyspace.com%2F&amp;t=YmY4ZTUzMmNmYTAwOWIyYTMyOGZlNmEwZmI5ODAyNmVlZGFkOWRhZixZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">Facebook </a>who write this stuff have probably thought of all of this and found that this way was best.</p><h2>Can I stop you from doing this to me?</h2><p>Kinda. Coincidentally, because my script is always running, collecting data, I show up as “online” all the time. If you were also running a script like this, it would partially prevent what I’m doing from working on you, since you always show up as “online”, no matter what you’re <i>really</i> doing. Activity from the Messenger app will still show up separately, though.</p><h2>tl;dr</h2><ul><li><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FCRRJVwIUwAAf-wP.png&amp;t=NjUwNjQyZDc1YmUxNTk4OGEwY2Q5ZmE3M2FlNWQ4MDM4ZDIzMWNhOSxZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">Facebook </a>sends your computer a bunch of interesting information when you’re on <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FCRRGTVcU8AA7veC.png%3Alarge&amp;t=OWQzYjBjNDZlZWU4NmRlZjc3NGE2NWNlZWNmZWMxNzdiYzkwYjRkMyxZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">facebook.com</a>. <br/></li><li>You can collect that information over time and use it to keep track of when people are on <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdudududu.de%2F&amp;t=OGVhZjI4NzZjYzdiYjM2ZmEyNWIyNTBhZGU2YTUwZmFjMTM2ZGQ4OSxZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">Facebook</a>, and which devices they’re using.<br/></li><li>You can make a pretty good guess as to what time people are going to sleep and waking up</li><li>It’s creepy, but I don’t see a way for <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhishing%23Link_manipulation&amp;t=NDBiMDMyNjlmYTFhNmY0NGRmNmY4NzBkMzY3YmUwOTczYTZjZTlkZCxZRkpQNkM5SQ%3D%3D">Facebook </a>to stop allowing this while still making their chat app good.</li></ul><h2>So how does this make money again?</h2><p>Oh, no no no.
