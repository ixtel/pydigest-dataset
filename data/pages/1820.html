<h2>Bugfix releases issued</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>James Bennett</strong> on October 22, 2014 </span>

<p>Today we're issuing the first bugfix release in the 1.7 release series, along with bugfix releases for each of the other supported release series (1.4 and 1.6), plus the final bugfix release of the 1.5 series. Although Django 1.5 is technically already past its end-of-life, a regression discovered in the last 1.5 release prompted another release.</p>
<p>Details can be found in the release notes for each release series:</p>

<p>The release packages and checksums are, as always, available from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a>, as well as from the Python Package Index.</p>
