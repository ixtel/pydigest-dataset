</p><div dir="ltr" trbidi="on"><a href="http://scons.org/wiki/">SCons</a><p> is a build tool written completely in Python, so that you can just put it into your repository, extend for your own purposes and run directly from checkout without installing anything. SCons documentation doesn't use word </p><b>plugin</b><p> to refer to extensions. It calls them </p><b>Tools</b><p>. If you're not familiar with SCons concepts, check out </p><a href="http://scons.org/wiki/BasicConcepts">this wiki page</a><p>.

</p><h4>Plugin Discovery</h4>
<p>SCons tries its best to avoid magical behavior. That's why it ignores paths and options set in system environment and requires that you specify everything explicitly. The same is true for plugins. Example from SCons man page:</p><p/><pre><code class="prettyprint">env = Environment(tools = ['default', 'foo'], toolpath = ['tooldir'])</code></pre><div><p>This creates build environment, initializes default tools, sets lookup path for plugins to </p><i>tooldir/</i><p> and enables tool named </p><i>foo</i><p>, which is located in </p><i>tooldir/foo.py. </i><i>foo.py</i><p> should have two functions - generate(env) and exists(env).
</p><p>
To test that your tool is found correctly, check env['TOOLS']:
</p><pre class="prettyprint">print(env['TOOLS'])</pre><p>If filename is not there - SCons was unable to find it. If it was a problem with contents of </p><i>foo.py</i><p> - SCons would fail with exception.
</p><p>
SCons has an automatic tool discovery mechanism - if you don't like to specify </p><i>toolpath</i><p> directly - you may place your tool in one of several locations that SCons scans before executing SConstruct. See description of the </p><a href="http://www.scons.org/doc/HTML/scons-man.html">--site-dir=dir option</a><p> for details.</p></div></div>
<h4>Version compatibility and future</h4>
<div><p>Described behavior is true for </p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/scons/scons/src/tip/src/CHANGES.txt?at=default">SCons 2.3.4</a><p> and earlier versions. It may be not very intuitive, so things may change in future, especially if we find resources to integrate </p><a href="https://pairlist2.pair.net/pipermail/scons-dev/2014-September/001939.html">Parts</a><p>.
