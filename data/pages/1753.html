<h2><em><strong><span><span>Egyptian Multiplication</span></span></strong></em></h2>
<p><span><span>The ancient Egyptians used a curious way to multiply two numbers. The algorithm draws on the<a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/binary.shtml">binary system</a>: multiplication by 2, or just adding a number two itself. Unlike, the <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml">Russian Peasant Multiplication</a> that determines the involved powers of 2 automatically, the Egyptian algorithm has an extra step where those powers have to be found explicitly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The applet below allows for experimentation with the algorithm I’ll present shortly. The two blue numbers at the top – the <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/few_words.shtml#multiplicand">multiplicands</a> – can be modified by clicking on their digits. (The digits can be treated individually or as part of a number depending on the state of the “Autonomous digits” checkbox.) The number of digits in the multiplicands changes from 1 through 4.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br/>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Write two multiplicands with some room in-between as the captions for two columns of numbers. The first column starts with 1 and the second with the second multiplicand. Below, in each column, write successively the doubles of the preceding numbers. The first column will generate the sequence of the powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, … Stop when the next power becomes greater than the first multiplicand. I’ll use the same example as in the <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml">Russian Peasant Multiplication,</a> 85×18:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The right column is exactly the same as it would be in the <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Algebra/PeasantMultiplication.shtml">Russian Peasant Multiplication.</a> The left column consists of the powers of two. The red ones are important: the corresponding entries in the right column add up to the product 85×18 = 1530:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Why some powers of two come in red, while others in gold? Those in red add up to the first multiplicand:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>which corresponds to the binary representation of 85:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>According to the Rhind papyrus these powers are found the following way.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>64 is included simply because it’s the largest power below 85. Compute 85 – 64 = 21 and find the largest power of 2 below 21: 16. Compute 21 – 16 = 5 and find the largest power of 2 below 5: 4. Compute 5 – 4 = 1 and observe that the result, 1, is a power of 2: 1 = 2<sup>0</sup>. This is a reason to stop. The powers of two that go into 85 are 64, 16, 4, 1.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For the product 18×85, we get the following result:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>It is also called as Russian peasant Algorithm.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now let us deal this problem in python</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>first prepare imports</span></span></p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">from __future__ import division
import math</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p><span><span>we can design a function that returns the greatest power of 2 which is less than or equal to the given no.Because we need to frequently use that concept.</span></span></p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">def greatest2power(n,i=0):
    while int(math.pow(2,i)) &lt;= n : i = i+1
    return int(math.pow(2,i-1))
</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now let us take inputs.a multiplier, and a multiplicand.</p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">m = int(raw_input('Enter multiplicand'))
n = int(raw_input('Enter multiplier'))</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><span><span> Now according to the above description,Set greatest to first,and least to second.</span></span></p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">if m&gt;n : first , second = m , n
else : first , second = n , m</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><span><span> We are simulating two columns for 85 and 18 with fcol,scol.Seed is the two multiple which is used to populate those columns according to the algorithm. </span></span></p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre>fcol , scol = [] , []
seed = 1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><span><span> Now we are populating the two columns with the values generated as algorithm described.Code snippet below is quite obvious.</span></span></p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">while seed &lt;= greatest2power(first):
    fcol.append(seed)
    scol.append(second*seed)
    seed = seed*2</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><span><span> Now we need to compute the valid powers of two which are subtracting from the first element and store them in a list.</span></span></p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">valid , backseed = [] , seed//2
while backseed&gt;=1:
    valid.append(backseed)
    temp = backseed
    backseed = greatest2power(first-backseed)
    first = first - temp
</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The above snippet is analogous to (85-64=21, 21&gt;16) and (21-16=5,5&gt;4),     (5-4=1&gt;=1).so [64,16,4,1] are the valid powers of 2.</p>
<p>Now we iterate over that zip of fcol , scol in order to fetch the corresponding element for a valid two power.</p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">answer = 0
for sol in valid:
    for a,b in zip(fcol,scol):
        if a==sol:
            answer = answer+b
</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally we got the answer stored in answer variable.we are printing it.</p>
<div class="highlight-python">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="gp">print 'The Egyptian Product is:%d'%answer 
</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>What is the specialty in this?.Instead we can do straight forward multiplication.The actual beauty lies in the Egyptian strategy was they used only 2 in their calculation.If you see in the program raising a 2 power is equivalent of adding 2 extra to it.So Egyptians did multiplications with addition operator and number 2 as we did in program.Here goes the complete code here.</p>
