<html><body><div><div class="recent-paragraph"><p>We’ve decided to emphasize one programming framework for the software applications and websites we build.</p>

<p>While our team can create applications in all of the major programming languages, we believe that focusing on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> allows us to serve our clients the best.</p>

<p>WHY WE CHOSE TO FOCUS ON ONE PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK<br/>
We believe focusing on one programming framework builds efficiency into our work. Because we work in the same development environment time after time, we are growing expertise that crosses over from project to project. This allows our team to create applications and websites more efficiently and reliably.</p>

<p>Working in one framework over and over has also allowed us to build libraries of code that we can use from project to project. This allows us to offer our clients greater options in terms of functionality.</p>

<p>WHY WE CHOSE DJANGO AS OUR PROGRAMMING FRAMEWORK<br/>
Django is a programming framework built to use the <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> programming language. This framework was developed by an online-news operation, to let developers create reliable web applications quickly.</p>

<p>Django is built to grow and connect naturally. It has templates, libraries and API designed to work together. So apps built in Django can naturally grow with your business, which lowers the cost of upgrades, changes and additions.</p>

<p>This connectivity allows developers to adhere to the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontRepeatYourself" target="_blank">DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principle</a>, which creates cleaner, more reliable code. For example, Django offers template inheritance, which allows developers to base new page views off already existing pages—making repetitive coding unnecessary.</p>

<p>One of our developers put it this way: “Django handles the tedious parts for you.”</p>

<p>Django also includes an automatic admin interface that is easy to use. This gives clients a cost-effective tool that enables them to update their websites or applications themselves. It’s also possible for our team to use the functionality to build a beautiful custom interface for admins and users alike.</p>

<p>We’ve found Django to be a flexible framework that allows our expert team to build cost-effective applications and websites for our clients in a timely matter, and to ensure that our clients’ users have good experiences with the applications.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we’ve focused on Django and embraced the Django community, by competing in <a href="http://djangodash.com/judging/c4/results/team/176/" target="_blank">Django Dash</a> and learning from our fellow developers and their DjangoCon sessions.</p>

<p>The results of this focus are smarter + healthier web and mobile application solutions for our clients—proving that focusing on one development framework was the right choice.</p>
