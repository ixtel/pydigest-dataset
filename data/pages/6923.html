<h3><strong>Getting it to work</strong></h3>
<p>You can get the source code at our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/josauder/procedural_city_generation">Github Page</a></p>
<p>If you have git installed, you can clone the repository instead of downloading it as a .zip archive
with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>git clone https://github.com/josauder/procedural_city_generation.git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Dependencies:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>python 2.7+</li>
<li>numpy (1.8.2+)</li>
<li>scipy (0.14.1+)</li>
<li>matplotlib (1.4.2+)</li>
<li>PyQt4 (4.8.6+)</li>
<li>Blender 2.6x+</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now, this project runs on both Python 2 and 3.
All dependencies except Blender should be included in any scientific python distribution (e.g. Python(x, y) and Anaconda).
To start the program with the GUI (assuming all dependencies are installed):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>cd procedural_city_generation
python GUI.py
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If everything worked so far, the GUI should open up and look like this:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="#getting-it-to-work"><img alt="_images/GUI.png" class="align-center" src="_images/GUI.png"/></a>
<p>If not, then there is probably a missing dependency. To troubleshoot, try running the python file /test/Tester.py by using the following command from the procedural_city_generation directory:</p>

<p>This will generate a log file in procedural_city_generation/procedural_city_generation/outputs/test.log which might contain valuable clues about why this is not working. If you can not figure it out yourself, please create an issue at our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/josauder/procedural_city_generation">Github Page</a>.</p>
<p>The last step (“Visualize in Blender”) will not work on windows machines because you can not run blender by simply typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>blender --python "procedural_city_generation/visualization/blenderize.py"
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>from the command line. On windows you will have to run this script manually by opening blender, and replacing the path with the path to procedural_city_generation/procedural_city_generation directory.</p>

<h3><strong>About this Project</strong></h3>
<p>This project started as a university project at the Technische Universität Berlin. As part of the MINTGr�n Program in which students get to dedicate two semesters to enrolling in whatever courses from all STEM fields, with the goal to figure out, which of those fields they want to pursue a future in.
After the semester was over, we continued working on the project though, with the goal in mind to make it usable for as many people as possible.</p>
<p>The entire code is open source and we are open for any feedback. If you run into any issues when using this program, please feel free to open an issue on our  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/josauder/procedural_city_generation">Github Page</a> or even propose a fix with a pull request.</p>
