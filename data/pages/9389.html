                    <p>You should go to <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.eu">DjangoCon Europe</a> in lovely <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich">Zurich</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Here are 10 reasons why:</p>
<div class="section" id="chocolate">
<h2>1. <strong>Chocolate</strong></h2>
<p>So much of what we like about chocolate comes from Switzerland. For example, Milk Chocolate was invented in Switzerland.</p>

<div class="section" id="keynote-speaker-jacob-kaplan-moss">
<h2>2. <strong>Keynote speaker: Jacob Kaplan-Moss</strong></h2>
<p>Always a great speaker and fun to be around, he's one of the BDFL's of <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cheese">
<h2>3. <strong>Cheese</strong></h2>
<p>I grew up thinking that Swiss Cheese was just about holes. It's so much more. I can't wait to try fresh European cheese made by master craftsmen from the freshest ingredients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keynote-speaker-jessica-mckellar">
<h2>4. <strong>Keynote speaker: Jessica McKellar</strong></h2>
<p>In a word, Jessica is <strong>incredible</strong>. She's a Twisted core developer, PSF board member, part of the trio responsible for the gigantic Boston Python User Group's massive size explosion, and a talented speaker. She's used her incredible talents and skills to increase diversity in the community and generally help other people.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="breakfast">
<h2>5. <strong>Breakfast</strong></h2>
<p>Muesli was invented in Switzerland. I love Muesli. I was floored by how much better it was in New Zealand. I can't wait to try it in it's homeland.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="web-site">
<h2>6. <strong>Web Site</strong></h2>
<p>The DjangoCon Europe site is crazy. I mean, look at all those animations!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="talks">
<h2>7. <strong>Talks</strong></h2>
<p>This is a single track event with proven speakers like Zachary Voase and Andrew Godwin, yet balances that with bringing in new blood to spice things up. And dare I say <a class="reference external" href="http://2012.djangocon.eu/schedule/round-pegs-and-square-holes/">I'm giving a technical talk</a> with <a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com/">Audrey Roy</a>? ;-)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mountains">
<h2>8. <strong>Mountains</strong></h2>
<p>With all the incredible food, you would think you would gain umpteen kilograms. Fortunately there are mountains all around to climb and hike.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sprints">
<h2>9. <strong>Sprints</strong></h2>
<p>Want to sprint on Django itself? Look no further because there will be Django core developers around! There will also be notable <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> developers like <a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/">Kenneth Reitz</a> and others around working hard on a lot of different projects. It's going to intense and fun!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="castles">
<h2>10. <strong>Castles</strong></h2>
<p>Living in the USA, we just don't have anything like castles. DjangoCon Europe will be near a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_and_fortresses_in_Switzerland#Zurich">small horde of stone fortifications</a>. Which means if the Zombie Apocalypse happens during the conference, we'll have many secure places to go. They also make lovely tourist destinations. :-)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-you-waiting-for">
<h2>What are you waiting for?</h2>
<p>DjangoCon Europe has a cap on attendance. Tickets for Python events have been selling out, not just for PyCon US. Don't miss out!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-s-all-about-me">
<h2>It's all about me</h2>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>Call me selfish but I want you there because I haven't haven't met all our European friends yet in person. Hope to see you next month in Zurich!</p>
