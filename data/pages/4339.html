<p>Simply removing the <code>python</code> symlink from <code>~/miniconda3/bin/</code> appears to do the job.</p>

<pre><code>$ which python           
/home/naught101/miniconda3/bin/python
$ rm /home/naught101/miniconda3/bin/python
$ which python                            
/usr/bin/python
$ source activate science                 
discarding /home/naught101/miniconda3/bin from PATH
prepending /home/naught101/miniconda3/envs/science/bin to PATH
(science)$ which python           
/home/naught101/miniconda3/envs/science/bin/python
(science)$ source deactivate                       
discarding /home/naught101/miniconda3/envs/science/bin from PATH
$ which python     
/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>

<p>So far, this doesn't seem to have caused me any problems. Unfortunately the same doesn't work for <code>~/miniconda/bin/python3</code>, because conda requires it when switching to other envs that use the same python version. However, that one hasn't caused as many problems in the first place.</p>

<p>If this <em>does</em> cause problems, it's easy enough to undo, just <code>cd ~/miniconda/bin/; ln -s python3 python</code> (or what ever version of python you're using in your conda root env). You may need to activate/deactivate an env to get that version of python back on your PATH.</p>
