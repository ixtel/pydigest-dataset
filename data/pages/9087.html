<p>A Proxy Selection Tool for Windows</p>








<p>From time to time it is necessary to change the systems proxy settings. This
can be due to network changes or to test software with internet access on
different proxies or proxy settings. However, always walking through the
Windows system dialog and manually changing the settings is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Therefore, this small python project enables the quick change of the proxy
settings either programmatically by using the provided module functions, or
from the command line, by calling the command line scripts, that are part of
this project as well.</p>

<h2>Change Log</h2>
<div id="a1">
<h3>0.3.0a1</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a first draft of the set command</li>
<li>The winproxy view command was broken if
* no overrides were set at all
* less overrides were set, than should be shown at most</li>
<li>The override list may contain not only ‘;’ separated proxies, but also ‘,’
separated ones. This may even be mixed. Also, there may be whitespace in the
Text. This all is now corrected for, i.e., setting override through the
ProxySettings API will always normalize the string to ‘;’ delimited proxies.</li>
<li>Missing registry values fall back to sensible defaults</li>
</ul>
