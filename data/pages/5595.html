<span><a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/show/18/python-anti-patterns-and-other-mistakes" target="_blank">Episode #18: Python Anti-patterns and other mistakes</a></span><br/>
Often the most important lessons we learn is what NOT to do. Show #18 is all about BAD Python code and Python Anti Patterns with Andreas Dewes. Listen in to learn about the "Empty Intern Except Block" and other dubious coding decisions! But it's not all bad news. Andreas and his crew at Quantified Code have build some amazing tools to visual and determine code quality and ferret out these anti-patterns. Are you brave enough to run them on your code? <br/>

<span><a href="http://pythonpodcast.com/holger-krekel-pytest.html" target="_blank">Podcast.__init__ Episode 16 - Holger Krekel on Pytest</a></span><br/>
In this episode we talked to Holger Krekel about the py.test library. We discussed the various styles of testing that it supports, the plugin system and how it compares to the unittest library. We also reviewed some of the challenges around packaging and releasing Python software and our thoughts on some ways that they can be improved.<br/>

This tutorial teaches gradient descent via a very simple toy example, a short python implementation.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html" target="_blank">How to Create NBA Shot Charts in Python</a></span><br/>
This post goes over how to extract a player's shot chart data and then plot it using matplotlib and seaborn.<br/>

Lets talk about some of the handy tools that you can use to profile Python code.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://aakashjapi.com/fuckin-search-engines-how-do-they-work/" target="_blank">Implementing a Search Engine with Ranking in Python</a></span><br/>
This post shows you how to make a search engine for local text files that can handle standard queries (at least one of the words in the query appears in the document) and phrase queries (an entire phrase appears in the text) and can rank using the basic tf-idf scheme.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/07/27/installing-opencv-3-0-for-both-python-2-7-and-python-3-on-your-raspberry-pi-2/" target="_blank">Installing OpenCV 3.0 for both Python 2.7 and Python 3+ on your Raspberry Pi 2</a></span><br/>
By the end of this step-by-step guide you'll have the brand new OpenCV 3.0 library installed on your Raspberry Pi 2, along with either Python 2.7+ or Python 3+ bindings. This is definitely an exciting tutorial -- up until now only Python 2.7 was supported by OpenCV. But now given the OpenCV 3.0 release, we can finally utilize Python 3+ in our projects.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.alfredo.motta.name/data-manipulation-primitives-in-r-and-python/" target="_blank">Data manipulation primitives in R and Python</a></span><br/>
Both R and Python are incredibly good tools to manipulate your data and their integration is becoming increasingly important1. The latest tool for data manipulation in R is Dplyr whilst Python relies on Pandas. In this blog post I'll show you the fundamental primitives to manipulate your dataframes using both libraries highlighting their major advantages and disadvantages.<br/>

<span><a href="http://ly0n.me/2015/07/25/exploit-writing-simple-buffer-overflows/" target="_blank">Exploit writing: Simple buffer overflow's</a></span><br/>
This post will be some kind of "buffer overflow exploiting for dummies". In buffer overflow based exploits what we do is overwrite important parts of the program's memory by sending an extra large buffer of data to the program via the network, a program control box, input, etc. When our buffer overwrites the program's memory we are able to redirect the execution flow of the program and run injected code into it.<br/>

<span><a href="http://import-lymph.link/" target="_blank">import lymph</a></span><br/>
This post explains how to write and run services with lymph. We explore lymph's capabilities and tooling by progressively creating a little cluster, service by service. It is very much hands-on and example-driven. <br/>

<strong><span><span><span>Interesting Projects, Tools and Libraries</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup" target="_blank">dev-setup</a></span><br/>
Simple single script setup to install and configure developer apps and tools.

A stealthy Python based backdoor that uses Gmail as a command and control server.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/hitchtest/hitch" target="_blank">Hitch</a></span><br/>
Hitch is a loosely-coupled, isolated by design testing framework built upon python's unittest that lets you write simple, easy to read and easy to debug tests for any software (not just web apps and not just python apps).<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/tmadl/semisup-learn" target="_blank">semisup-learn</a></span><br/>
Semi-supervised learning frameworks for python, which allow fitting scikit-learn classifiers to partially labeled data.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/pindexis/qfc" target="_blank">qfc</a></span><br/>
Quick Command-line File Completion. It is a shell auto-complete alternative which features real-time multi-directories matching: It provides results while you type against files in the current directory and its sub-directories. This is useful, to avoid the burden of writing the whole path whenever you want to cd or vim a file, which is frequent especially if you use the terminal as your IDE.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/warner/magic-wormhole" target="_blank">magic-wormhole</a></span><br/>
Get things from one computer to another, safely. This package provides a library and a command-line tool named wormhole, which makes it possible to get short pieces of text (and arbitrary-sized files) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the receiving machine. Wormhole codes are single-use and do not need to be memorized.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/runstats/" target="_blank">RunStats</a></span><br/>
RunStats is an Apache2 licensed Python module that computes statistics and regression in a single pass. Supported summary statistics include min, max, mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Simple linear regression calculates slope, intercept and correlation. It's implemented in pure-Python with 100% code coverage, complete documentation, and numerically stable algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/" target="_blank">ScanCode</a></span><br/>

<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/facebook/codemod" target="_blank">codemod</a></span><br/>
Codemod is a tool/library to assist you with large-scale codebase refactors that can be partially automated but still require human oversight and occasional intervention. Codemod was developed at Facebook and released as open source.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/ekampf/pymaybe" target="_blank">PyMaybe</a></span><br/>
A Python implementation of the Maybe pattern.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/billpmurphy/hask/" target="_blank">Hask</a></span><br/>
Haskell language features and standard libraries in pure Python.<br/>
