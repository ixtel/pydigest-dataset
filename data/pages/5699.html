<h2>An Introduction to Pretenders</h2>
<p>The <tt>pretenders</tt> project creates flexible fakes for external network
services. These external services can be faked by setting pre-canned answers,
defining expectations, or just querying them on received data after [test]
execution.</p>
<p>They are loosely designed along the pattern of Record/Replay/Verify.</p>
<div id="python-compatibility">
<h3>Python Compatibility</h3>
<p>The server side of Pretenders is written in Python3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because we firmly believe all new projects should use Python3, unless
there are <em>very</em> compelling reasons against it.</li>
<li>Because since these will be run as standalone servers, compatibility
is not such an issue</li>
</ul>
<p>In the cases we implement a client, we will be making this runnable in
Python 3.x and Python 2.6/2.7.</p>
</div>
<div id="mocked-servers-available">
<h3>Mocked Servers Available</h3>
<p>Pretenders currently supports the mocking of HTTP and SMTP servers.</p>
<p>Future services we are considering to support include AMQP and ssh.</p>
<p>These represent the vast majority of the services that the software we
write interacts with.</p>
<p>Some example use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mocking external HTTP-based APIs at the wire level in module integration
tests</li>
<li>Facilitating the manual testing and debugging of front-end Ajax code
where the back-end has not been developed yet</li>
<li>Writing fully automated tests for any system that sends email, and
where we want to easily verify outgoing mails</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretenders provides a unified RESTful API to verify the interactions of
our code with external services, regardless of the service protocol.</p>
</div>
<div id="pretenders-client-http-http-server">
<h3>pretenders.client.http - HTTP server</h3>
<p>Typical usage is to mock RESTful/SOAP APIs of external services.</p>
<p>This will normally require pre-programming the service with responses,
and enquiring the service later about received requests. This can be done
with specialised assertions / matchers, or by setting expectations and
verifying fulfilment of such expectations.</p>
<p>The pre-programming step may be done by using specific proprietary HTTP
headers, or by using an alternative HTTP port to the one used for mocking.</p>
<p>For example usage see the <a href="http://pretenders.readthedocs.org/" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Implementation is based on the <tt>bottle</tt> web microframework.</p>
<p>One of our goals will be that the wire protocol is simple enough that you do
not need any specialised client. That said, we will be providing client
libraries (at least one in Python) to simplify interacting with the server,
and to provide a comfortable API to use in tests.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Pretenders welcomes contributions in any form - be it pull requests, adding an
issue or feedback via <a href="https://github.com/pretenders/pretenders" rel="nofollow">github</a> or sending a message on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pretenders-project" rel="nofollow">pretenders</a>
mailing list so donâ€™t be shy!</p>
<p>We have the following branching convention:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>master: This should look exactly like the latest release.</li>
<li>develop: This is where ongoing work lands, only being merged into master
at release point.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to contribute, fork the repo in <a href="https://github.com/pretenders/pretenders" rel="nofollow">github</a> and branch from the develop
branch. Create your PRs into develop in the main repo.</p>
<div id="running-the-tests">
<h3>Running the tests</h3>
<p><tt>build.sh</tt> runs the full suite of tests, as well as building the sphinx docs
and checking for pep8 errors.</p>
