<p>How can I restrict Dashboard users? I have installed the gateway app that ships with the sandbox site, but as far as I can tell, users are just approved automatically for dashboard access. Obviously this is a security concern. I have already blocked non-authenticated users from viewing portions of the site, but I need to be able to restrict/approve access to the dashboard. </p>

<p>The way I see it, I would have to write a custom view/form to be able to do it from the dashboard, and have the pending account registration feed to that.</p>

<p>Any pointers would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>import logging

logger = logging.getLogger('gateway')


class GatewayView(generic.FormView):
    template_name = 'gateway/form.html'
    form_class = forms.GatewayForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        real_email = form.cleaned_data['email']
        username = generate_username()
        password = generate_username()
        email = 'dashboard-user-%s@oscarcommerce.com' % username

        user = self.create_dashboard_user(username, email, password)
        self.send_confirmation_email(real_email, user, password)
        logger.info("Created dashboard user #%d for %s",
                    user.id, real_email)

        messages.success(
            self.request,
            "The credentials for a dashboard user have been sent to %s" % real_email)
        return http.HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('gateway'))

    def create_dashboard_user(self, username, email, password):
        user = User.objects.create_user(username, email, password)
        user.is_staff = True
        user.save()
        return user

    def send_confirmation_email(self, real_email, user, password):
        msg = get_template('gateway/email.txt').render(Context({
            'email': user.email,
            'password': password
        }))
        send_mail('Dashboard access to Oscar sandbox',
                  msg, 'blackhole@latest.oscarcommerce.com',

This just automatically creates an is_staff user, as long as the email is valid.</p>
