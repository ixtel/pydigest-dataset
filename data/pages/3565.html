<p>I hosted a small workshop at <a href="http://kth.se">KTH</a> (where I'm currently pursuing a master in Machine Learning), presenting Python's capabilities as a tool for data-processing (or "data science" if you prefere fancy terms!) and machine learning.</p>

<p>You can view <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/halflings/data-processing-and-machine-learning-with-python">the slides on Speaker Deck</a> (or embedded below), and I highly recommend having a look at <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/halflings/python-data-workshop/blob/master/data-workshop-notebook.ipynb">the accompanying IPython notebook</a>. (all sources are available, including the notebook, are available on <a href="https://github.com/halflings/python-data-workshop">this repo</a>)</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Please disregard the slides where I encourage people to use Python 2.7 over Python 3. That's a controversial stance and one out of place for such a presentation, sorry!</p>
