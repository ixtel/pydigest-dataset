<span><a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/10/25/selfie/" target="_blank">What a Deep Neural Network thinks about your #selfie</a></span><br/>
Convolutional Neural Networks are great: they recognize things, places and people in your personal photos, signs, people and lights in self-driving cars, crops, forests and traffic in aerial imagery, various anomalies in medical images and all kinds of other useful things. But once in a while these powerful visual recognition models can also be warped for distraction, fun and amusement. In this fun experiment we're going to do just that: We'll take a powerful, 140-million-parameter state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network, feed it 2 million selfies from the internet, and train it to classify good selfies from bad ones. <br/>

<span><a href="http://claymcleod.github.io/papers/distributed-dnn/paper.html" target="_blank">A Framework for Distributed Deep Learning Layer Design in Python</a></span><br/>
In this paper, a framework for testing Deep Neural Network (DNN) design in Python is presented. First, big data, machine learning (ML), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are discussed to familiarize the reader with the importance of such a system. Next, the benefits and detriments of implementing such a system in Python are presented. Lastly, the specifics of the system are explained, and some experimental results are presented to prove the effectiveness of the system.<br/>

Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look or what to look for. Thanks to the work of some dedicated developers, Python has one of the best machine learning platforms called scikit-learn. In this episode, Alexandre Gramfort is here to tell us all about scikit-learn and machine learning. <br/>

Kay Hayen is a systems engineer from Germany who has dedicated his spare time to the creation of Nuitka, a library that will compile your Python project to C++. In this episode we talked to Kay about what inspired him to create the project, how it operates, and some of the challenges he has faced. It is a very interesting project and it has the potential to let you run your Python code in a whole new way!<br/>
