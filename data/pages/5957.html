            <p>Today is an exciting day! We have just finished releasing IPython 4.0, the last piece of the first release of Jupyter and IPython after <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/2015/04/15/the-big-split/">The Big Split™</a>.</p>

<p>The quick way to get Jupyter upgraded is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install --upgrade jupyter  
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using conda or canopy, we hope to have packages on those distros soon.</p>

<p>This means that when you do</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install --upgrade ipython[all]  
</code></pre>

<p>You will get jupyter instead.</p>

<h2 id="refresheronthebigsplit">Refresher on The Big Split™</h2>

<p>IPython 3 was the last major monolithic release of IPython containing all of the language-agnostic code, such as the notebook, which is moving under the new name <em>Jupyter</em>. As part of that process, we have created several discrete packages for each component - <code>nbformat</code> for the notebook format, <code>nbconvert</code> for the notebook conversion machinery, <code>notebook</code> for the HTML notebook application, etc.</p>

<p>You can get each of these components independently, e.g. with</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install --upgrade notebook  
</code></pre>

<p>which will not include the pieces that the notebook doesn't depend on (e.g. <code>qtconsole</code>). Or you can get the whole thing with the <code>jupyter</code> metapackage, which will pull in everything that was part of IPython 3 (with the exception of IPython parallel, now called <code>ipyparallel</code>).</p>

<p>Since all of these packages were part of IPython 3, they are all starting out at 4.0. They won't be updated in coordination with each other as their APIs and release schedules will be allowed to advance at their own respective paces.</p>

<p>There are import shims in the IPython repo for backward-compatibility, so any code that imports <code>IPython.nbformat</code>, for instance, should continue to work with a warning about the new home of the package:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: from IPython.nbformat import read  
/.../site-packages/IPython/nbformat.py:13: ShimWarning: The `IPython.nbformat` package has been deprecated. You should import from nbformat instead.
</code></pre>

<p>If you have any code that imported from the old subpackage that worked on 3.x but doesn't on 4.x, please <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues">let us know</a>.</p>

<p>This split also means that</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">pip install ipython  
</code></pre>

<p>gets you a much smaller install, since it only includes the terminal IPython interface, which some people have been asking for for a long time.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>Many of the ipython subcommands are now jupyter subcommands, e.g.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">ipython notebook  
</code></pre>

<p>is now</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">jupyter notebook  
</code></pre>

<p>The configuration files for these jupyter commands are now in your <code>~/.jupyter</code> directory instead of <code>~/.ipython/profile_default</code>. Jupyter should automatically migrate your notebook and qtconsole config to the new location if they exist.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config.html">Jupyter config docs</a> for more info.</p>

<h2 id="docs">Docs</h2>

<p>See the new <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Jupyter docs</a> for more information about Jupyter, its components, and installation.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>Please let us know <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jupyter">on the mailing list</a> if you have issues with the new install, or open an Issue on GitHub for the repo that is misbehaving. There's a lot of reorganization, and we thank you for your patience during this transition.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks to everyone who helped with the Big Split! Here's to a bright future for IPython and Jupyter.</p>
