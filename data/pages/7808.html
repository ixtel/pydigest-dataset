              <h1>XlsXcessive 0.3.0</h1>

              


<p>A Python library for writing .xlsx files.</p>








<div id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>XlsXcessive provides a Python API for writing Excel/OOXML compatible .xlsx
spreadsheets. It generates the XML so you don’t have to and uses the openpack
library by YouGov to wrap it up into an OOXML compatible ZIP file.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-workbook">
<h2>Creating a Workbook</h2>
<p>The starting point for generating an .xlsx file is a workbook:</p>
<pre>from xlsxcessive.xlsx import Workbook

workbook = Workbook()
</pre>
</div>
<div id="adding-worksheets">
<h2>Adding Worksheets</h2>
<p>The workbook alone isn’t very useful. Multiple worksheets can be added to the
workbook and contain the cells with data, formulas, etc. Worksheets are created
from the workbook and require a name:</p>
<pre>sheet1 = workbook.new_sheet('Sheet 1')
</pre>
</div>
<div id="working-with-cells">
<h2>Working With Cells</h2>
<p>Once you have a worksheet you can add some cells to it.:</p>
<pre>sheet1.cell('A1', value='Hello, world')
sheet1.cell('B1', value=7)
sheet1.cell('C1', value=3.14)
sheet1.cell('D1', value=decimal.Decimal("19.99"))
</pre>
<p>Strings, integers, floats and decimals are supported.</p>
<p>You can also add cells via row index and column index.:</p>
<pre>sheet1.cell(coords=(0, 4), value="Added via row/col index")
</pre>
<p>This is useful when iterating over data structures to populate a sheet with
cells.</p>
</div>
<div id="calculations-with-formulas">
<h2>Calculations With Formulas</h2>
<p>Cells can also contain formulas. Formulas are created with a string representing
the formula code. You can optionally supply a precalcuated value and a
<tt>shared</tt> boolean flag if you wish to share the formula across a number of
cells. The first cell to reference a shared formula as its value is the master
cell for the formula. Other cells may also reference the formula.:</p>
<pre>formula = sheet1.formula('B1 + C1', shared=True)
sheet1.cell('C2', formula) # master
sheet1.cell('D2', formula) # shared, references the master formula
</pre>
</div>
<div id="cells-with-style">
<h2>Cells With Style</h2>
<p>The library contains basic support for styling cells. The first thing you do is
create a style format. Style formats are shared on a stylesheet on the
workbook.:</p>
<pre>bigfont = workbook.stylesheet.new_format()
bigfont.font(size=24, bold=True)
</pre>
<p>Once you have a style format you can apply it to cells.:</p>
<pre>sheet1.cell('A2', 'HI', format=bigfont)
</pre>
<p>Other supported style transformations include cell alignment and borders.:</p>
<pre>col_header = workbook.stylesheet.new_format()
col_header.align('center')
col_header.border(bottom='medium')
</pre>
</div>
<div id="adjusting-column-width">
<h2>Adjusting Column Width</h2>
<p>It is possible to adjust column widths on a sheet. The column width is specified
by either number or index.:</p>
<pre># these are the same column
sheet1.col(index=0, width=10)
sheet1.col(number=1, width=10)
</pre>
<p>TODO: Referencing columns by letters.</p>
</div>
<div id="merging-cells">
<h2>Merging Cells</h2>
<p>Cells can be merged together.  The left-most cell in the merge range should
contain the data.:</p>
<pre>from xlsxcessive.worksheet import Cell
a3 = sheet1.cell('A3', 'This is a lot of text to fit in a tiny cell')
a3.merge(Cell('D3'))
</pre>
</div>
<div id="it-s-time-to-save-your-work">
<h2>It’s Time To Save Your Work</h2>
<p>You can save the generated OOXML data to a local file or to an output file
stream.:</p>
<pre># local file
save(workbook, 'financials.xlsx')

# stream
save(workbook, 'financials.xlsx', stream=sys.stdout)
</pre>
</div>
<div id="future">
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>This is certainly a work in progress.  The focus is going to be on improving the
features that can be written out in the .xlsx file. That means more data types,
styles, metadata, etc. I also want to improve the validation of data before it
is written in an incorrect manner and Excel complains about it. I don’t think
this library will ever be crafted to read .xlsx files. That’s a job for another
library that can hate its life.</p>
