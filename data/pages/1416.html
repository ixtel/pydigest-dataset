      <p class="p-first">When I started Lincoln Loop back in 2007, Django was still a pre-1.0 fringe player in the web framework world. It’s come a long way since then and so has its supporting ecosystem. A lot of bad practices have shaken out and we now have a good blueprint for deploying stable, fast, and scalable Django sites.</p>

    <p>I was inspired to write this book by the “in the wild” Django projects we came across in our consulting business. Time and again, we would see very bright and talented
    engineering teams making poor technology decisions. These decisions were not only expensive, but the unknown source of stress and grief. It dawned on me that if
    experienced teams like these were struggling, what chance did your average
    developer have?</p>

    <p>We’ve spent the last few months pouring our years of learning (often times the hard way) into this book. The goal of this book is to give you our blueprint so you can build and deploy
    high performance Django sites with confidence. We hope you enjoy it.</p>
