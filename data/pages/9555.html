<p>Tiny 'shelve'-like database with concurrency support</p>








<p>PickleShare - a small ‘shelve’ like datastore with concurrency support</p>
<p>Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike shelve,
many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a value in
database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the same database.</p>
<p>Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. Hence
the “database” is a directory where <em>all</em> files are governed by PickleShare.</p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre>from pickleshare import *
db = PickleShareDB('~/testpickleshare')
db.clear()
print "Should be empty:",db.items()
db['hello'] = 15
db['aku ankka'] = [1,2,313]
db['paths/are/ok/key'] = [1,(5,46)]
print db.keys()
</pre>
<p>This module is certainly not ZODB, but can be used for low-load
(non-mission-critical) situations where tiny code size trumps the
advanced features of a “real” object database.</p>
<p>Installation guide: pip install path pickleshare</p>
