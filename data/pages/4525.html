<p><a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> is an awesome little Python interpretor that can run on embedded platforms.  Using the familiar <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python programming language</a> you can talk to hardware and control it, much like controlling hardware with an Arduino or other embedded board.  The <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2390">MicroPython board</a> makes it easy to get started using MicroPython, but did you know you can use MicroPython on other platforms like the nifty <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471">ESP8266 WiFi module</a>?  Thanks to recent contributions to MicroPython you can turn an ESP8266 into a MicroPython device, and this guide will show you how to get started by compiling and installing MicroPython firmware for the ESP8266!</p>
<p>Before you get started one thing to note is that MicroPython's support for the ESP8266 is still in <strong>very early stages of development</strong> <strong>and not all MicroPython board functionality is available</strong>.  Currently you can access GPIO pins, connect to a WiFi network, and talk to the internet using a low-level socket-like interface with MicroPython on the ESP8266.  Access to I2C, SPI, or other parts of hardware are not yet supported--<strong>consider MicroPython on the ESP8266 just for advanced users right now!</strong></p>
<p>However if you're interested in hacking on and even contributing to MicroPython for the ESP8266 this guide will show you how to setup a toolchain for building the MicroPython ESP8266 firmware.  You can even use the toolchain built from this guide to create other ESP8266 projects!</p>
<p>Also many thanks to the contributors of the <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk">ESP open SDK</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/themadinventor/esptool">esptool</a> projects.  These excellent open source projects make possible this and other awesome MicroPython &amp; ESP8266 projects--thanks!</p>
