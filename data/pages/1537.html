                        <p>Just click Apply above and we’ll guide you through the process. If you have your ISIC card

                            or can access your student mailbox, it will take only a few minutes.
                            Make sure to read the <a href="license_educational.html">License Terms</a> carefully.

                        <p>At the moment, those are the only two ways we can verify your student status. We do recommend that
                            you get an ISIC card as it offers other bonuses as well.

                        <p>Well, your Academic License is perpetual and you may use it as long as you comply with the license
                            terms in your license agreement. But to get the latest version, you either need to upgrade to a
                            Personal license or apply for a Student License. Note that the Student License covers many more
                            products, and always the latest versions.

                        <p>No, the Student License is valid for one year and perpetual licenses are not provided. After
                            one year you will need to renew your Student License for the next year, or purchase a
                            license if you’re no longer a student.</p>

                                account</a>, or check the email reminder we send out one week before your license

                            discount, which can be used toward the purchase of a new personal subscription for any
                            single JetBrains product or for the <i>All Products pack</i>. A Graduation discount should
                            be
                            redeemed within 1 year of your Student License expiration date. Use your <a href="https://account.jetbrains.com">JetBrains account</a> to purchase a license, and
                            the discount will be applied
                            automatically. Please note that the offer cannot be combined with the Student License
                            renewal. (However, should you renew your Student License, a similar Graduation offer will be
                            available to you the next year.)
