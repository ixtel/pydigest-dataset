During an April 13 keynote at </p><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/">PyCon</a><p>, Van Lindberg, chair of the </p><a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a><p> (PSF) board, announced that PSF membership would now be open to the entire community.  It had previously been a </p><a href="/Articles/545527/#who">self-sustaining membership</a><p>, with current members nominating new members, but that has now changed.  Community members can sign up as PSF members by way of a "Become a Member" button at the bottom of the </p><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python home page</a><p>. Filling out a a form and agreeing to the </p><a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a><p> is all that is required to join. Instead of the roughly 200 members reported at PyCon 2013, he would like to see 30,000 or more PSF members by the end of 2014.  This is part of an effort to diversify the PSF in much the same way that the Python community itself has diversified over the years, Lindberg said.</p><hr align="left"/><p>
