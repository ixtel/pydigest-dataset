		We are provisioning new instances for our python app.<br/>
		Our pypi mirror is running here<br/>
		in our colocation center.<br/>
		Unfortunately compilation of some packages is still failing.<br/>
		It's so bad that we have to ssh in and install dependencies manually.<br/>
		With pip in 3.4 and wheels<br/>
		all this will finally settle down.<br/>
		Mein Fuehrer<br/>
		3.4<br/>
		3.4 isn't being adopted by anyone.<br/>
		Everybody is still sitting on 2.7<br/>
		Leave the room if you are still using 2.7, 2.6, older or pypy.<br/>
		It's been SIX years!<br/>
		It's been SIX god forsaken years!<br/>
		Since 2008 the core devs have practically been doing a circle jerk.<br/>
		And why exactly did we split the community?<br/>
		Just to turn print into a function?<br/>
		Just to get rid of byte strings!?<br/>
		Meanwhile the cheeseshop smells worse than ten year old Limburger.<br/>
		On every package install I'm executing code straight off the internet!<br/>
		Mein Fuehrer, pip will check the ssl certificate.<br/>
		Well then pip install yourself a CERTIFIED backdoor!<br/>
		Mein Fuehrer, you're trusting the package maintainer anyway.<br/>
		Package maintainers can be hacked too.<br/>
		How about declarative package descriptions for a start?<br/>
		I can't tell you how many hours I've spent,<br/>
		searching documentation on how to write a correct setup.py file<br/>
		and I wasn't even trying to compile a C module!<br/>
		distribute v1 and v2, setuptools, packaging, eggs, wheels, scripts, endpoints<br/>
		"There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it."<br/>
		The sadistic bastards who created this mess <br/>
		have caused more misery and pain in this world than Stalin!<br/>
		I give up at this point.<br/>
		I'll just clone a VM, so at least I'll only have to<br/>
		wade in this shit once.<br/>
		As for PyPy.<br/>
		It's like there's a conspiracy to kill every alternative interpreter!<br/>
		Does compatability and adoption mean nothing?!<br/>
		Jython and Iron Python are bleeding demised.<br/>
		Not to forget stiff unladen dead swallow!<br/>
		This is an X language!<br/>
		Come now, Guido will fix it with Pyston.<br/>
		Now we have to deal with Javascript.<br/>
		It's spreading like an STD in a frat house.<br/>
		We're doomed.<br/>
		All because of Netscape.<br/>
		But you gentleman better believe I'm not switching to node.js.<br/>
		I'd rather shoot myself in the head.<br/>
		Bloody callback hell.<br/>
