<h2>A Bulk-Upload Library for DocumentCloud</h2>
<p>pneumatic is a Python 3 library that adds some luxury and safeguards to the bulk-uploading of hundreds, thousands or hundreds of thousands of files to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org" rel="nofollow">DocumentCloud</a>. It is meant to do one thing – upload – and serve as an adjunct to, but not a replacement for, the excellent <a href="http://python-documentcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">python-documentcloud</a> API wrapper.</p>
<p>pneumatic’s name is inspired by the pneumatic dispatch systems in newsrooms of yore, which featured a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tube" rel="nofollow">series of pneumatic tubes</a> for sending copy from the newsrooms to other departments such as the composing room.</p>
