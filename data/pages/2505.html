<h2>What is Democratic Programming?</h2><p>
This is the answer to what would happen if you take a group of people and ask them to make a program by voting on what to do with the source code. </p><p>
The winning option is chosen by chance, every vote makes it more likely the option will win.</p><p>
Example: if A has 500 votes and B has 300 votes then A will on average win 500 out of 800 times.</p><p>
The maximum time between votes is 2 minutes for commands and 1 minute for parameters, every time someone votes this is lowered with 2 seconds untill the vote ends in 30 seconds.
</p><h2>Possible commands</h2>
<h3>changeline</h3><p>
This command changes or creates a line of code.</p><p>
The first argument is the line number, if it is an integer the specified line will be changed.</p><p>
If it is a float then a new line will be inserted between floor(line number) and ceil(line number)</p><p>
Max linenumber: 1000, if higher defaults back to 1000
The second argument is be the code inserted at the given line (max length: 250 chars). 
</p><h3>deleteline</h3><p>

</p><h3>Commit</h3><p>
