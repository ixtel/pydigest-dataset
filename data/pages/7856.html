<p>A network entropy distribution system</p>








<a href="https://travis-ci.org/infincia/NetRNG" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/infincia/NetRNG.svg?branch=master"/></a>
<p><strong>Note: The master branch of this code is alpha quality but usable</strong>.</p>
<p>NetRNG is effectively a network connected hardware random number generator.</p>
<p>It allows devices like the RaspberryPi, Beaglebone, or any machine with a TPM,
Entropy Key, or other hardware random number generator onboard to act as a NetRNG
server, providing high quality random data to other machines on the network.</p>
<p>Virtual machines can potentially benefit the most from NetRNG, as they typically
suffer from poor quality local entropy sources due to their running environment.</p>
<p>No application or kernel changes are required on NetRNG Client machines; any
application using <tt>/dev/random</tt> and <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> will automatically and
transparently receive entropy from the NetRNG server.</p>
<div id="why-it-exists">
<h2>Why it exists</h2>
<p>EntropyBroker is the closest similar project I know of, but it didn’t build when I
tried to use it, and the code seems quite large and complicated for a task that,
conceptually, is very simple.</p>
<p>So I wrote NetRNG. It’s simple code, easy to maintain, easy to deploy, and with
the exception of some network protocol issues before v0.1, it works quite
well.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-it-works">
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>As a complete system, NetRNG links <tt>/dev/hwrng</tt> on one machine, to <tt>/dev/random</tt>
on many others, carefully ensuring that each machine receives unique entropy samples,
while allowing the entropy to be validated for quality and ensuring that entropy
is fairly distributed among connected clients.</p>
<p>It is essentially a persistent pipeline from one machine to many others, with
some minor restrictions on how the pipeline functions to make it suitable for the
task.</p>
<p>However, netrng.py itself does one job and only one job: it moves random data
around on the local network. Other tasks like validating the samples and providing
them to the kernel entropy pool are left to <tt>rngd</tt> from rng-tools, which is
automatically started and managed by NetRNG.</p>
</div>
<div id="server">
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The NetRNG server reads from <tt>/dev/hwrng</tt> (configurable), dividing up the stream
in to non-repeating, non-overlapping samples of a size defined in the configuration
file, then sends each one to clients on the local network.</p>
<p>The maximum number of clients that will be accepted can be configured on the server,
this allows you to prevent a slow HWRNG from being spread too thin among too many
clients.</p>
<p>I’m working on a QoS style load management system that will allow you to guarantee
that each connected client can receive entropy samples at a specific rate, 10KB/s
for example. Clients would be allowed to connect until the server could no longer
guarantee that entropy rate to each of them.</p>
</div>
<div id="client">
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>The client starts <tt>rngd</tt> from rng-tools as a subprocess, then connects to the
server and starts requesting entropy samples from it. Then each sample is forwarded
to <tt>rngd</tt> for processing.</p>
<p>Then, <tt>rngd</tt> validates the quality of the entropy sample before submitting it to
the Linux or FreeBSD kernel for other programs to use via <tt>/dev/random</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div id="common-devices-to-use-as-the-netrng-server">
<h2>Common devices to use as the NetRNG server</h2>
<ul>
<li>RaspberryPi</li>
<li>Beaglebone</li>
<li>PC Engines ALIX</li>
<li>Various server mainboards</li>
<li>Any machine with a TPM chip onboard</li>
<li>Any machine with an Entropy Key</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="setup">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>There is very little actual configuration required for NetRNG, but until it is
packaged and uploaded to PyPi you’ll need to manually clone the repository and
package it for installation.</p>
<p>Feel free to install the generated package wherever you like, but <tt>/opt/NetRNG</tt>
is the default where the bundled init/upstart script are pointed, so if you
install the module somewhere else make sure to change them once they’re copied
to /etc/.</p>
<p>I don’t advise installing the package in the main system python package directory,
use a virtualenv to make things easier :)</p>
<p>Note: these instructions are written for Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives, you’ll
need to determine the equivalent native package names for build-essential and
python-dev.</p>
<p>The virtualenv activation is repeated on purpose in certain steps to ensure that
someone who isn’t following the steps sequentially won’t accidentally install
python modules in the global system (not being root helps here, but just in
case…).</p>

<div id="clone-the-repo">
<h2>Clone the repo</h2>
<pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/
git clone https://github.com/infincia/NetRNG.git
</pre>
</div>
<div id="create-virtualenv">
<h2>Create virtualenv</h2>
<p>Create a virtualenv for NetRNG:</p>
<pre>virtualenv /opt/NetRNG
</pre>
</div>
<div id="setup-build-environment">
<h2>Setup build environment</h2>
<p>Some NetRNG dependencies require building python C extensions, so we need to
install a compiler and python development headers so they’ll build properly
during installation of the NetRNG package:</p>
<pre>apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install python-dev
</pre>
<p>The <cite>wheel</cite> module is also needed to build NetRNG, so we install it in to the
virtualenv:</p>
<pre><span class="nb">source</span> /opt/NetRNG/bin/activate
pip install wheel
</pre>
</div>
<div id="build-and-install-netrng">
<h2>Build and install NetRNG</h2>
<pre><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/NetRNG
<span class="nb">source</span> /opt/NetRNG/bin/activate
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install dist/netrng*.whl
</pre>
</div>

<div id="configuration">
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Copy and rename the sample config file on all machines before use:</p>
<pre>cp /opt/NetRNG/conf/netrng.conf.sample /etc/netrng.conf
</pre>
<p>The NetRNG server requires very little configuration on most systems, but the
client requires setting the right server address and setting the mode to ‘client’.</p>
<p>The rest of the configuration should be fine unless you have a very slow HWRNG and
need to tweak the data flow settings. The defaults send 2KB chunks of random data
to each connected client as fast as possible. You can tweak sample_size_bytes if
needed. This process may be automated in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="run-for-testing">
<h2>Run for testing</h2>
<p>Since the compiled daemon script is available on your path while the virtualenv
is activated, you can run it directly after the config file is determined to be
correct:</p>
<pre><span class="nb">source</span> /opt/NetRNG/bin/activate
netrngd
</pre>
</div>
<div id="long-term-use">
<h2>Long term use</h2>
<p>I have written both Upstart and systemd scripts for netrngd.</p>
<p>If someone would like to contribute other types of init scripts I will gladly
accept a pull request.</p>
<p>To use the the systemd script:</p>
<pre>cp /opt/NetRNG/conf/netrng.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start netrng
</pre>
<p>To use the Upstart script:</p>
<pre>cp /opt/NetRNG/conf/netrng.conf.upstart /etc/init/netrng.conf
service netrng start
</pre>
