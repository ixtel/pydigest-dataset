<p>I am supposed to add a specific label to my <code>CSV</code> file based off conditions. The <code>CSV</code> file has 10 columns and the third, fourth, and fifth columns are the ones that affect the conditions the most and I add my label on the tenth column. I have code here which ended in an infinite loop:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
import sys

w = open(sys.argv[1], 'w')
r = open(sys.argv[1], 'r')

reader = csv.reader(r)
writer = csv.writer(w)

for row in reader:
    if row[2] or row[3] or row[4] == '0':
        row[9] == 'Label'
        writer.writerow(row)

w.close()
r.close()
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know why it would end in an infinite loop.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I made a mistake and my original infinite loop program had this line:</p>

<pre><code>w = open(sys.argv[1], 'a')
</code></pre>

<p>I changed <code>'a'</code> to <code>'w'</code> but this ended up erasing the entire <code>CSV</code> file itself. So now I have a different problem.</p>
