<p>I've had it on github for a while, but I finally released <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ddlgenerator/0.1.1">ddlgenerator</a> to PyPI.</p>

<p>I've been frustrated for years that there was no good open-source way to set up RDBMS tables from flat data files.  Sure, you could import the data - after setting up the DDL by hand.  ddlgenerator handles that; in fact, you can go from zero, setting up and populating a table in a single line.  Nothing up my sleeve:</p>

<pre>
$ psql -c "SELECT * FROM knights"
ERROR:  relation "knights" does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT * FROM knights
                      ^
$ ddlgenerator --inserts postgresql knights.yaml | psql
CREATE TABLE
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
INSERT 0 1
$ psql -c "SELECT * FROM knights"
    name    |         dob         |   kg    | brave

<p>This is a fairly complex tool so I'm sure you'll be using <a href="https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ddl-generator/issues">the bug tracker</a>.  But I hope you'll enjoy it nonetheless!</p>
