Attempt #1, complete.</p><p>It's been about 48 hours since I started this project, and I'm already staring at a somewhat passable model. Of course, there's much room for improvement, but for such little effort I have to say I'm pretty pleased with the results. Stay tuned for attempt #2, in which I plan to:</p><ol><li>actually learn how to use Meshlab</li><li>buy a stepper motor (so I don't have to manually rotate the damn thing)</li><li>configure the webcam to take raw 1080p images (although it's capable of doing so, I was only using 300x480)</li><li>upgrade the Black&amp;Decker level/laser to something of higher quality</li></ol><p>Until next time. Happy researching,</p><p>Will</p></div></div></body></html>
