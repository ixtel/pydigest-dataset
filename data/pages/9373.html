                    <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from my <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com">blog</a>. I'm here to talk to you about a very import subject: <strong>Submitting your talk early to PyCon US.</strong></p>
<p>Last year there were hundreds of talks were submitted for just a very few speaking slots. <strong>Unpaid volunteers</strong> labored for hours before and after their normal jobs reviewing and debating which talks were to get in. The volume of talks combined with simple reviewer fatigue means that earlier submitted talks got more attention.</p>
<p>This year, following the pattern of previous years, we're going to have 25% more talk submissions.</p>

<h2>Production notes for this service message</h2>
<p>I've always wanted to do one of those TV public service messages done by B or C grade actors. As a D-grade blogger I thought I might be a pretty good match for the role. :-)</p>
