<p>This is what your code created</p>

<p>It's a list where the first and last elements are pointing to two numbers (1 and 2) and where the middle element is pointing to the list itself.</p>

<p>In Common Lisp when printing circular structures is enabled such an object would be printed as</p>

<pre><code>#1=#(1 #1# 2)
</code></pre>

<p>meaning that there is an object (labelled 1 with <code>#1=</code>) that is a vector with three elements, the second being the object itself (back-referenced with <code>#1#</code>).</p>

<p>In Python instead you just get the information that the structure is circular with <code>[...]</code>.</p>

<p>In this specific case the description is not ambiguous (it's backward pointing to a list but there is only one list so it must be that one). In other cases may be however ambiguous... for example in</p>

<pre><code>[1, [2, [...], 3]]
</code></pre>

<p>the backward reference could either to the outer or to the inner list.
These two different structures printed in the same way can be created with</p>

<pre><code>x = [1, [2, 3]]
x[1][1:1] = [x[1]]

y = [1, [2, 3]]
y[1][1:1] = [y]

print x, y
</code></pre>

<p>and they would be in memory as</p>
