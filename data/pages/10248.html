<p>Biomolecular simulation remote job submission tool.</p>








<p>Longbow is a piece of software that acts as a job proxying tool for
biomolecular simulations, Longbow reproduces the native look and feel of using
popular molecular dynamics packages (AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD),
with the difference that when those packages are used through Longbow
simulations can be run on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources such as
ARCHER. Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts,
automatically stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back
simulation results. The option is also there to persistently monitor and stage
(realtime local syncing with remote simulation files) simulation files at a
specified time interval.</p>
<p>This is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to
the user as if the simulation has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do
not have to concern themselves with writing submission files, nor do they have
to worry about staging. Longbow provides a convenient interface for generating
large ensembles of simulation jobs which in effect extends the packages it
supports.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Releases can be installed either via pip or can be installed manually, to
install via pip:</p>
<p>pip install longbow</p>
<p>or to install manually (see docs) Longbow can be downloaded here:</p>

<p>Please note: In cases where you run the setup script, Longbow will create the
host configuration file in a hidden directory in your user directory. In some
cases doing a manual install (not using the setup.py) then you will have to
make this yourself.</p>
