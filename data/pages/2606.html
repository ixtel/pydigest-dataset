I had blogged a few times earlier about </p><a href="http://www.dominodatalab.com/">Domino Data Lab</a><p>, which is the maker of </p><b>Domino</b><p>, a </p><b>Python PaaS (Platform as a Service) for data science</b><p> (though it can also be used for general programming in the cloud). I had done a trial of it and found it to be quite good and easy to use. In fact Domino's ease of use for cloud programming was one of the points I specifically noticed and commented on, after trying it out.

Here is the last of those posts:

That post links to my earlier posts about Domino.

Today I got to know that they are hosting a free webinar on parallel programming with Python and R, using Domino. Here are the details:

</p><p>
Free webinar on parallel programming in R and Python
</p><p>
We'll show you how to utilize multi-core, high-memory machines to dramatically accelerate your computations in R and Python, without any complex or time-consuming setup.
</p><p>
You'll learn:
</p><p>
How to determine whether your tasks can be parallelized on multi-core, high-memory machines
</p><p>
General purpose techniques in R and Python for parallel programming
</p><p>
Specific applications of parallel programming in a machine learning context, including how to speed up cross-validation, grid search, and random forest calculations
</p><p>
Finally, how to use Domino for easy access to powerful multi-core machines where you can utilize these techniques.

About the instructor
</p><p>
The webinar will be led by Nick Elprin, one of Domino’s co-founders. Before starting Domino, Nick was a senior technologist and technology manager at a large hedge fund, where he managed a team that designed, developed, and delivered the firm’s next generation research platform. He has a BA and MS in computer science from Harvard.
