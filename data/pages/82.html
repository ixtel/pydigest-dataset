    <p><strong>django-ckeditor</strong> repository wasn't updated from a long time and a lot of issues collected. With the release of Django 1.6 django-ckeditor stopped working due to "defaults" in urls.py import. I've decided to polish and release <a href="https://github.com/riklaunim/django-ckeditor/commits/master">my fork</a> as a pypi package to make it easier to install the newer version. You can install it via pip using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-ckeditor-updated"><strong>django-ckeditor-updated</strong></a> as name. Current version is 4.2.1.</p>
<p>Biggest change compared to the upstream is <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/files/storage/">Django storage API</a> usage for file uploads (to make it easier to configure and to allow using other backends than local folder - like S3 storage). Other updates give CKEditor 4.2.1 as well as Django 1.6 support (should also work on 1.4 and 1.5).</p>
<p>This application gives you the CKEditor on a model field in Django admin or in your forms. The editor can be configured (interface) and it can upload images (with the help of pillow).</p>
