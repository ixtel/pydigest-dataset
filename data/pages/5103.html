	<p><strong>1. Whitenoise</strong></p>
<blockquote class="large"><p>With a couple of lines of config, WhiteNoise allows your web app to serve its own static files, making it a self-contained unit that can be deployed anywhere without relying on nginx, Amazon S3 or any other external service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whitenoise handles Gzipping your content and setting far-future cache headers on content. With a trivial amount of work, you can configure your app to automatically append a hash to each of your static files every time you deploy changes, so that you can set the cache headers as so.</p>

<p>A WSGI compliant app literally requires a few lines of code changes to deploy Whitenoise:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">from whitenoise import WhiteNoise

from my_project import MyWSGIApp

application = MyWSGIApp()
application = WhiteNoise(application, root='/path/to/static/files')
application.add_files('/path/to/more/static/files', prefix='more-files/')
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this important? Using Gzip significantly reduces file sizes / page load for static files. Search engines also detect Gzip compression, penalizing websites that don’t implement it. Being discovered is critical for any early-stage company, and enabling Gzip is low hanging fruit to enable this (not to mention, also providing a better user experience). Thanks to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/peterldowns">Peter</a> for showing this to me.</p>

<p>You can find Whitenoise <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whitenoise">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Phonenumbers (lite)</strong></p>

<p>Validating phone numbers is not easy, and there are tons of valid formats that make using regular expressions impossible. Moreover, even if a number passes a regular expression for formatting, it may still not be valid.</p>

<p>Invalid: 222-222-2222 (but it would pass common regular expression tests)<br/>
Valid: 313-442-1231 ext. 901</p>

<p>Relying solely on a regular expression would mean you reject valid phone numbers and accept invalid ones!</p>

<p>Solution: use <a href="https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers">python-phonenumbers</a>, a port of Google’s libphonenumber. </p>

<p>We chose to use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phonenumberslite/7.0.2">phonenumberslite</a> because it does not include geocoding, carrier, and time zone metadata and is significantly smaller.</p>

<p>This library makes it trivial to validate phone numbers. Using this library ensures that you accept a variety of formats, with various formats / schemes and ensure they are valid.</p>

<p><strong>3. Pdfkit</strong></p>

<p>Pdfkit makes it simple to generate PDFs from html. Why would one use this? Let’s say you have an invoice page in your app – you can use the same code to render that page to render a downloadable PDF for customers or your own records. Here’s how simple it is:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">import pdfkit

pdfkit.from_file('test.html', 'out.pdf')

# Generating PDFs from strings and web-pages is equally easy:

pdfkit.from_string('Hello!', 'out.pdf')
pdfkit.from_url('http://google.com', 'out.pdf')
</code></pre>

<p>Another perk of this library is that it is a binding to the extremely resilient and maintained library <a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/">wkhtmltopdf</a>.</p>

<p>You can find pdfkit <a href="https://github.com/JazzCore/python-pdfkit">here</a>.</p>

<p>Tons of APIs exist for creating PDFs – however, we’re fans of this library because it’s actually easier than connecting to an API, and totally free.</p>

<p><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></p>

<p>These are 2 libraries we love, but they are so common that they don’t merit their own section. If you haven’t used them, they are certainly worth a look:</p>

<p><strong>Requests</strong>: requests is an elegant HTTP library.</p>

<p><strong>Python-dateutil</strong>: Numerous date utilities for calculating differences, etc. The most useful of these is a resilient date parser:</p>

<pre><code class="prettyprint">import dateutil.parser

&gt;&gt;&gt; dateutil.parser.parse("May 4th, 2012") 
datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 4, 0, 0) 

&gt;&gt;&gt; dateutil.parser.parse("5-4-2012") 
datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 4, 0, 0) 

&gt;&gt;&gt; dateutil.parser.parse("5.4.2012") 
datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 4, 0, 0) 

&gt;&gt;&gt; dateutil.parser.parse("4th May 2012") 
datetime.datetime(2012, 5, 4, 0, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>These are a few libraries we found extremely useful.  What other libraries do you think merit consideration?</p>
