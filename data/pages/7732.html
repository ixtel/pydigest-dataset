<p>Hi Vancouver Pythonistas!</p>
<p>The next <b>Vancouver Python Meetup</b> will be held on <b>November 25 at 7PM</b>. This meetup is graciously hosted by <a href="http://www.mobify.com/">Mobify</a>. <b>Doors open at 6:30 and we intend to start at 7 PM sharp</b><span>, so please schedule your arrival accordingly.</span></p>
<p>We have two excellent talks scheduled:</p>
<p><b>Adaptors and the Death of a 300-Line If</b>  <br/>Michael JasonSmith</p>
<p>Sometimes code gets away from us. In this talk, Michael will present a war story about a 300-line if-statement that lurked deep within the code base for the GroupServer mailing list manager, how the code came about, and how he wrangled it to something that could be managed more easily. For those new to Python, he will present some techniques and libraries for managing data. For more experienced Pythonistas, he will demonstrate a way to implement the Adaptor pattern, which is a useful technique to decompose software into smaller parts.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Process Management with Chalmers</b>  <br/>Sean Ross-Ross</p> 
<p>Sean is a senior software developer at Continuum Analytics and the author of <i>Chalmers</i>, a Python an application that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on any operating system. Sean will provide an overview of Chalmers, and will discuss how it can benefit your process management needs.</p>
<p>Please RSVP today. See you at the meetup!</p>
