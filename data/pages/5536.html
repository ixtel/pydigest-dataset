<h2>EB-CLI</h2>
<p>EB Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you deploy and manage
your AWS Elastic Beanstalk applications and environments. It also
provides integration with Git. This file provides a sample walkthrough of EB CLI. To view a list of commands, type:</p>
<blockquote>
eb –help</blockquote>
<p>For more information about a specific command, type:</p>
<blockquote>
eb {cmd} –help</blockquote>
<p>For detailed information about EB CLI, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-reference-eb.html" rel="nofollow">EB Command Line Reference.</a></p>
<div id="installation">
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>You will need administrator/sudo privileges unless you install into a virtual environment.
To install you will first need to install Python and Pip.
The most recent version of Python now includes pip.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow">To install Python, go here.</a></p>
<p>If you already have Python, but need to install Pip, <a href="http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html" rel="nofollow">go here.</a></p>
<p>After you have installed Pip, run the following command:</p>
<p>pip install awsebcli</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>EB CLI requires you to have AWS security credentials.
For procedures to get security credentials, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html" rel="nofollow">see the documentation.</a></p>

<h3>EB CLI Commands</h3>
<p>This section describes some EB CLI 3 commands and why you would use them.</p>
<div id="view-environment-status">
<h4>1. View environment status.</h4>
<blockquote>
eb status -v</blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>The status command will show you the current state of your application. This includes things such as:</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Environment Name</li>
<li>Application Version</li>
<li>Solution Stack</li>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Number of running instances</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div id="list-your-running-environments">
<h4>2. List your running environments.</h4>
<blockquote>
eb list</blockquote>
<p>The list command will show you a list of running environments.
The environment with an asterisk next to it is the default environment.
To see more detailed information about your environments, type the following to use verbose mode:</p>
<blockquote>
eb list -v</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="change-your-current-environment">
<h4>3. Change your current environment.</h4>
<p>You can run most commands with any environment by using the following syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
eb {cmd} &lt;environment&gt;</blockquote>
<p>To change your default environment, type the following:</p>
<blockquote>
eb use [environment_name]</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="open-the-aws-elastic-beanstalk-management-console">
<h4>4. Open the AWS Elastic Beanstalk management console.</h4>
<p>To view your environment in the AWS Management Console, type the following:</p>
<blockquote>
eb console</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="change-environment-variables">
<h4>5. Change environment variables.</h4>
<p>You can set environment variables for your running environment at any time by typing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
eb setenv foo=bar</blockquote>
<p>You can view your environment variables by typing the following:</p>
<blockquote>
eb printenv</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="using-eb-cli-with-git">
<h3>Using EB CLI with Git</h3>
<p>EB CLI 3 provides integration with Git. After running “git clone” or “git init”, run the following command:</p>
<blockquote>
eb init</blockquote>
<p>EB CLI 3 will now recognize that your application is set up with Git.</p>
<p>To use Git with EB CLI 3:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make any change to your code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After you make a change to your code, type the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>git commit</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Deploy your updated code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when you run the “eb deploy” command, EB CLI will only deploy the code that was under source control.
Make sure to always commit what you want to deploy.
EB CLI uses your commit ID and message as the version label and description, respectively.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy to production.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are ready to deploy an updated version of your code, use Git tags.</p>
<blockquote>
git tag -a v1.0 -m “My version 1.0”</blockquote>
<p>The tag will be used for the version label so you always know which version your environment is running on.
If you have already deployed this version, EB CLI will deploy that version to your environment instead of uploading a new application version.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use branches.</li>
</ol>
<p>EB CLI enables you to associate different branches with different branches of your code.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>git checkout master</p>
<p>eb use prod</p>
<p>git checkout develop</p>
<p>eb use dev</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now whenever you switch to a new branch, your default environment will also switch.</p>
