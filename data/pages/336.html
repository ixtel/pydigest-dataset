<html><body><div><div class="post-body"><p>A.K.A <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute">distribute</a> is dead; long live distribute!</p>
<h2><a name="why-" class="anchor" href="#why-"/>Why?</h2>
<p>Hopefully most people know that distribute is now deprecated, and the
entirety of its functionality has been merged into the updated and now
active <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a> project. If you didn't, consider yourself informed.</p>
<p>If you've never used distribute or setuptools before, they are almost worth
it solely for their addition of <code>install_requires</code> in a python package's
<code>setup()</code> function, which allows one to specify software dependencies
of your python code before it will install.
That, and they are required by the wonderful <a href="http://pip-installer.org">pip</a>.
Along with active development, setuptools and python packaging are improving
at a rapid pace, making things easier and simpler for everyone. If you are
currently using distribute or your packages work directly with it, please
consider updating your little bit of python to the latest tools!</p>
<p>There are also practical reasons for updating: not only a myriad of bug fixes,
until roughly v1.0, setuptools/distribute didn't properly use a
verified HTTPS connection to download all resources. You <strong>want this</strong> for
the thing that installs your software! Over time it's also gained support
for a new installation format as well, which you'll hear about below.
At the time of writing, PyPI tells me that distribute has been downloaded
384810 times this week. We need to move on!</p>

<h3><a name="with-a-python-package-" class="anchor" href="#with-a-python-package-"/>With a python package:</h3>
<p>You might have a file called <code>distribute_setup.py</code> in the root of your python
project. This is a bootstrap file that can import all that nice installation
functionality if the user doesn't have setuptools or distribute installed.
When run directly through python it would also install distribute for you.
Essentially, you should replace this file with one called <code>ez_setup.py</code>
which can be retrieved from
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py">https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py</a></p>
<p>Notice the use of bitbucket's TLS connection to ensure you receive the
correct file. Your code in setuptools might then look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">setuptools</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">ImportError</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">ez_setup</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">use_setuptools</span>
    <span class="n">use_setuptools</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">setuptools</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">find_packages</span>

<span class="o">...</span>

<span class="n">setup</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>If you have any automated process to retrieve and install distribute, replace
it with setuptools.</p>
<h3><a name="with-your-system-s-python-" class="anchor" href="#with-your-system-s-python-"/>With your system's python:</h3>
<p>If you have distribute installed on your system (or a very old &lt;=0.6
setuptools), you should first uninstall or delete it as necessary,
and then install a new setuptools (easiest way to ensure you upgrade cleanly).</p>
<p>Installing setuptools from scratch can be done on a *nix system like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh"><div class="highlight"><pre>wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py <span class="p">|</span> python
</pre></div>
</code></pre>
<p>It may need to be done as root to update your system files.</p>
<p>On Windows you should be be able to simply download and double click the file
to have python run it.</p>
<p>Your goal is to have setuptools 2.x if you run Python &gt;=2.6, or 1.4.2 if you
are unfortunate enough to run 2.4 or 2.5. Or at the <em>very</em> least
some version &gt;1.</p>
<p>Please also consider updating to the latest versions of <code>pip</code>, <code>setuptools</code>
and <code>virtualenv</code>, if you use those.
Such a command to do so is <code>pip install -U pip setuptools virtualenv</code>.</p>
<h2><a name="why-now-" class="anchor" href="#why-now-"/>Why now?</h2>
<p>If you've been in the python packaging business for a few years, either
trying to distribute your own code, or just installing others', you might have
seen this image floating around at some point in your travels:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CZoLou4.png" alt="Distribute and Pip are the new hotness!"/></p>
<p>Ahh, the days when "new hotness" was still a cool phrase.</p>
<p>It's from a time when not so many cared about the python packaging ecosystem,
but a few were trying to improve it. Ian Bicking was working on some
cool new installation tool called <a href="http://pip-installer.org">pip</a> (now with the ability to
<em>uninstall</em> things!) and Tarek Ziad√© had forked the languishing <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">setuptools</a>
project into distribute, to further improve it (python 3 compatibility was
nice). Tarek has evidently put a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/overview">lot</a> of <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0376/">work</a> into <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/packaging.html">python
packaging</a> as a whole when many others weren't, so unless I missed it
I believe a lot of thanks is owed to him that he never received, for pushing it
as far as he did when it needed it most. As far as I can gather, he took so
much heat for his troubles and effort that he decided to stop working on the
problem all together. Fortunately it didn't stop him writing great python; his
newest <a href="http://circus.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">baby</a> looks extremely cool.</p>
<p>Around 2011, a lot of other people realised that the state of python's
"standard" packaging tools could be in a hell of a lot better shape than they
were, and weren't serving users that well. Some decided to create alternative
systems like <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/conda/index.html">conda</a>, while some decided to improve what was already there.
Probably the largest sea-change was to reinvigorate setuptools
by merging most of distribute into it (or possibly the other way around). To
this day I am a little confused as to why the merge was named "setuptools"
rather than "distribute", because it retroactively made the above image and
its advice unfortunately misleading. I imagine more than a few heads were
scratched coming to terms with the fact that the name of the active project
to be preferred had completely swapped. But it is as it is.</p>
<p>There is a <em>lot</em> more to be said about the history of python's
packaging ecosystem, and I really haven't done any justice to it,
but that's a little outside of this post's scope.
<a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2014/Thursday/75-Python_Packaging_2.0_Playing_Well_With_Others_-_Nick_Coghlan.mp4">This video</a> should be an interesting watch if you want to
know more.</p>
<p>As 2014 comes around a lot has changed and practically all for the better,
so it's a great time to update what you're using. <a href="http://wheel.readthedocs.org/">Wheels</a> are out, which
are a binary distribution format that essentially supersede eggs, are
pip-installable, and make things a lot easier for anyone distributing code that
isn't pure-python. But you'll need a recent setuptools and pip to use them!
I now whole-heartedly recommend <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org">virtualenv</a> to manage isolated python
environments, which are amazingly useful if you ever happen to work on more
than one python project involving 3rd party packages.</p>
<p>There is still a lot of work to be done also, especially for folks like Numpy.
They have complex binary dependencies to make their scientific python as fast
as it is, and sorting out how to manage those and still make things easy for
the user is by no means a solved problem. So <code>pip install numpy</code> is not yet a
recommended practice (you'll most likely get a very slow Numpy from doing so,
if it even installs at all). There is also a lot of bad blood to wash away
from when setuptools was a <em>completely</em> inadequate solution for them.</p>
<p>So of course, in order to improve things as fast as possible, it's best to
move on from legacy packaging tools, which are as of writing <code>distribute</code>
and <code>easy_install</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org">The Python Packaging User Guide</a> aims to be the ultimate resource
to help out anyone with regards to python packages. Just getting something
cool installed, or building your own. If someone asks you "so how do I
install python package <em>x</em>?", you can now give them this link.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's run by the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA), which have prominent
<a href="https://github.com/pypa">Github</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/">Bitbucket</a> accounts that organise and build
some of the most central packaging software around. You can talk in <code>#pypa</code>
on the Freenode IRC network, or their <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pypa-dev/">Google Group</a> as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine">Twine</a>, by Donald Stufft, makes it both very easy and secure to upload
packages of all kinds to PyPI. Check it out!</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a> makes working with virtualenvs <em>even easier</em> once you
learn a few of its awesome commands, like <code>mkproject</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For anyone that ever installs and tests a lot of package-based software,
wheels should make this process a <em>lot</em> faster. Not only are they fast to
install, you can create a cache of them from which <code>pip</code> can fetch them
locally, rather than downloading and installing each time. Check out the
<code>pip wheel</code> command and the <a href="http://wheel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#usage">Usage Section</a> of the wheel docs.
Integrating this workflow into python software building should cut down
almost anyone's build times drastically.</p>
<p>For anyone that's interested in cryptographically making sure their packages
are what they say they are and come from who they're supposed to, wheel also
comes with the <code>keygen</code>, <code>sign</code>, and <code>verify</code> commands to do this easily. I
bet there will come a time when this attack vector becomes important enough
for everyone to really start taking it seriously, so it's great to see python
is doing something about it now.</p>
<p>The soon-to-be-released python 3.4 should also start coming with pip <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.4.html#pep-453-explicit-bootstrapping-of-pip-in-python-installations">out of 
the box</a>, which will be awesome for starting off newbies.
Lastly, there's also work to refresh the venerable PyPI with a better, tested
code base to allow even more cool stuff to be done in the future - <a href="https://github.com/pypa/warehouse">warehouse</a>.</p>
<p>It's a bright and fervorous time for python packaging!</p>
