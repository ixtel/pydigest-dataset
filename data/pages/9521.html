<p>Docker Compose</p>
</div>
<p>Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your
application’s services. Then, using a single command, you create and
start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all
the features of Compose see <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/release/docs/overview.md#features" rel="nofollow">the list of
features</a>.</p>
<p>Compose is great for development, testing, and staging environments, as
well as CI workflows. You can learn more about each case in <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/release/docs/overview.md#common-use-cases" rel="nofollow">Common Use
Cases</a>.</p>
<p>Using Compose is basically a three-step process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Define your app’s environment with a <tt>Dockerfile</tt> so it can be
reproduced anywhere.</li>
<li>Define the services that make up your app in <tt><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt>
so they can be run together in an isolated environment:</li>
<li>Lastly, run <tt><span class="pre">docker-compose</span> up</tt> and Compose will start and run your
entire app.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <tt><span class="pre">docker-compose.yml</span></tt> looks like this:</p>
<pre>web:
  build: .
  ports:
   - "5000:5000"
  volumes:
   - .:/code
  links:
   - redis
redis:
  image: redis
</pre>
<p>For more information about the Compose file, see the <a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/release/docs/compose-file.md" rel="nofollow">Compose file
reference</a></p>
<p>Compose has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your
application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start, stop and rebuild services</li>
<li>View the status of running services</li>
<li>Stream the log output of running services</li>
<li>Run a one-off command on a service</li>
</ul>
