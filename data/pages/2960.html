<p>For some reason I've been thinking a lot about LOST lately--thinking about it enough that I rewatched the pilot a few nights ago. I got to thinking: how have all of the actors fared in their post-LOST careers? Despite it's trials and tribulations, did acting on LOST give a sense of purpose, just like Jack felt with the Island? Is it time yet for a career revitalizing LOST reboot?</p>
<p>Normally these questions are relegated to some very simple <a href="http://www.tvguide.com/galleries/lost-stars-1066587/">slide show listicle</a>. However, we don't have to settle for that! We've got data! We can perform a far more interesting analysis than   googling "Matthew Fox."</p>
<h3 id="The-Data">The Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Data">¶</a></h3><p>I scraped all of this data from IMDB, following the process below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get each actor that appears on the main page for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/">LOST</a> in IMDB (the top 15 actors by episode appearances).</li>
<li>Go to each actor's page and grab the list of movies/tv they have been in.</li>
<li>Go to each of those movie/tv pages and grab the title, score, and year info.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Additional-Notes">Additional Notes<a class="anchor-link" href="#Additional-Notes">¶</a></h3><p><strong>Minor Roles:</strong> To eliminate minor roles, I only counted roles where that actor appeared on the main cast list for that movie/tv. For example: Jorge Garcia was in two episodes of How I Met Your Mother, but doesn't appear on the main HIMYM IMDB cast page.</p>
<p><strong>Year info:</strong> For TV shows, the year included is the year that TV show premiered. It's not the year in which an actor might have appeared on the show. For example: everyone who appeared in LOST will have a year of 2004, regardless of when they actually started on the show. Actors this impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Emerson (first appeared 2006)</li>
<li>Elizabeth Mitchell (2006)</li>
<li>Ken Leung (2008)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Language:</strong>
I'll use <em>actors</em> to refer to both actors and actresses throughout this exploration. I'll use the term <em>media</em> to refer to the general collection of TV or Movies.</p>
