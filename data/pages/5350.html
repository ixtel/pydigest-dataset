<h2>What is Ibis?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-ibis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ibis is a new Python data analysis framework with the goal of enabling data
scientists and data engineers to be as productive working with big data as they
are working with small and medium data today. In doing so, we will enable
Python to become a true first-class language for Apache Hadoop, without
compromises in functionality, usability, or performance. Having spent much of
the last decade improving the usability of the single-node Python experience
(with pandas and other projects), we are looking to achieve:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>100% Python end-to-end user workflows</li>
<li>Native hardware speeds for a broad set of use cases</li>
<li>Full-fidelity data analysis without extractions or sampling</li>
<li>Scalability for big data</li>
<li>Integration with the existing Python data ecosystem (pandas, scikit-learn,
NumPy, and so on)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ibis Vision and Roadmap<a class="headerlink" href="#ibis-vision-and-roadmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ibis is being designed to take advantage of architectural synergies with the
<a class="reference external" href="http://impala.io/">Impala project</a> that will enable high performance Python
at massive scale without serialization or other interface
bottlenecks. Specifically, we have on the roadmap:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Support for Impala’s forthcoming <strong>complex types</strong>: lists, maps, and structs
as first-class value types.</li>
<li>Fast Python API for a canonical <strong>in-memory columnar data format</strong> being
developed for Impala and to be standardized amongst software components.</li>
<li>Enabling intepreted Python user-defined functions to be run on Impala nodes
and perform computations directly on columnar data in shared memory without
any need for deserialization. This will enable users to leverage the
<strong>existing Python data ecosystem</strong>, both tools and libraries, at performance
and scale never seen before.</li>
<li>Expanding the useful set of Python that can be translated to LLVM IR to
achieve true <strong>native performance at scale</strong> on complex data within Impala.</li>
<li>Exposing <strong>machine learning functionality</strong> already available in MADLib.</li>
</ul>
<p>This current version of Ibis includes a great deal of useful big data
functionality, putting Impala, the open source interactive SQL-on-Hadoop
engine, right at your fingertips in Python:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A pandas-like data expression system providing comprehensive coverage of the
functionality already provided by Impala. It is composable and semantically
complete; if you can write it with SQL, you can write it with Ibis, often
with substantially less code. This even includes such tricky relational data
concepts as<ul>
<li>Window functions</li>
<li>Correlated and uncorrelated subqueries</li>
<li>Self-joins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High level analytics tools like bucketing, top-k, histogram, and
value_counts.</li>
<li>Tools for performing computations directly on datasets in HDFS, hiding the
low-level details of Impala for accessing such data.</li>
<li>Tools to simplify interactions with HDFS</li>
<li>Interoperability with pandas: executing expressions returns pandas objects,
and pandas objects can be written back to HDFS (experimental).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s possible to support other compute engines in Ibis, or SQL databases like
PostgreSQL. In particular, Ibis’s data expressions are decoupled from the
Impala expression executor/compiler. We welcome community contributions to
integrate Ibis with other backend systems. Keep in mind that it’s a design goal
of Ibis to hide as much of backend complexity as possible.</p>
