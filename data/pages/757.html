<p>I've just released <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.2/">Morepath</a> 0.2! Morepath is your friendly
neighborhood Python web microframework with super powers.</p>
<p>Major changes include:</p>

<p>And various smaller tweaks. You can also read the <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.2/changes.html">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>What makes Morepath special? You can read about its <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.2/superpowers.html">superpowers</a> and read
how it <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.2/compared.html">compares</a> to other web frameworks, but here are some highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Route to model, then look up views. This leads to better link generation,
better generic views, better reusable code.</li>
<li>Have apps that can extend other apps, combine apps together. Extend
and override anything, even Morepath behavior itself, but don't
affect other apps in the same runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's lots of power contained in a small codebase.</p>
<p>(If you followed the <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/0.2/">Morepath</a> link above, ignore the <tt class="docutils literal">0.1</tt> in the
title bar there: those <em>are</em> the 0.2 docs, not 0.1. I've now fixed the
doc building configuration to include the version number from the
package itself.)</p>
