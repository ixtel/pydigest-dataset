<html><body><div><div class="sqs-block-content"><p>There are two files that might not look familiar. </p><p><strong>requirements.txt </strong>specifies the project's dependencies for pip, which is a dependency manager for Python. Heroku uses this file for two purposes: Detecting that the app is indeed a Python app and loading the dependencies.</p><p>By the way there's a good tutorial on running Python apps on Heroku <a target="_blank" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction">here</a>. Read it now if you're not familiar with running Python apps on Heroku. </p><p>How about <strong>.buildpacks</strong> then?</p><p>Not to go in too deep to Heroku's internals, but <a target="_blank" href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a> are responsible for how apps are detected, built and deployed. At the time of writing <a target="_blank" href="http://phantomjs.org">phantomjs</a> can't be used with the default Python buildpack. So we need to use two external build packs, which are specified in the file.</p><p>This would be good moment to try the test project for yourself. You need to have a <a target="_blank" href="https://signup.heroku.com/www-home-bottom">Heroku account</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com">Heroku command-line tools</a> installed first, though. Once you have those, just run the following commands.</p></div></div></body></html>
