				<h2>How to: Find out what modules a Python script requires</h2>
				<time>May 1, 2014</time>
		
				<p>I do a lot of my academic programming in Python, and – even though I often write about the importance of reproducible research – I don’t always document my code very well. This sometimes leads to problems where I have some code running fine, but I don’t know which modules it requires. These could be external libraries, or modules I’ve written myself – and it’s very frustrating to have to work out the module requirements by trial and error if I transfer the code to a new machine.</p>
<p>However, today I’ve realised there’s a better way: the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/modulefinder.html">modulefinder</a> module. I’ve written a short piece of code which will produce a list of all of the ‘base’ or ‘root’ modules (for example, if you run <tt>from LandsatUtils.metadata import parse_metadata</tt>, then this code will record LandsatUtils) that your code uses, so you know which you need to install.</p>
<p>Hopefully, like me, it’ll save you some time.</p>
