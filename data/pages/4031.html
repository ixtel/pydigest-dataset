<html><body><div><div class="sqs-block-content"><p>I've decided to start a tutorial series looking at how I go about prototyping projects using Python. As the goal is to get things done quickly but efficiently (and as I'll be learning a fair amount of this as I go), there WILL be mistakes. But hey, it's free!</p><p>Whilst this video is a basic introduction to NetworkX (one of the modules I'll be using, at least initially) the ultimate aim for the project is to grab data from the Transport For London API, map the tube lines and stations using NetworkX/MatPlotLib, and then customise the map drawing based upon attributes of the data (e.g. number of visitors, GPS coordinates etc.)</p><p>I'm hoping to get about one of these done a week if I can, though we'll see :) In the meantime, enjoy Episode 1...Â </p><p>NetworkX : <a href="http://networkx.github.io">http://networkx.github.io</a><br/>TFL API : <a href="http://api.tfl.gov.uk">http://api.tfl.gov.uk</a><br/>TFL Open Data : <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/</a></p></div></div></body></html>
