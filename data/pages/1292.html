<div class="section" id="morepath-videos">
<h2>Morepath videos!</h2>
<p>You may have noticed I linked to Morepath 0.5.1 before, not Morepath
0.5. This is because I had to as I was using a new youtube extension
that gave me a bit too much on readthedocs. I replaced that with raw
HTML, which works better. The Morepath docs now include two videos.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On the <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">homepage</a> is my talk about Morepath at EuroPython 2014 in
July. It's a relatively short talk, and gives a good idea on what
makes Morepath different.</li>
<li>If you're interested in the genesis and history behind Morepath, and
general ideas on what it means to be a creative developer, you can
find another, longer, video on the Morepath <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/history.html">history page</a>.  This
was taken last year at PyCon DE, where I had the privilege to be
invited to give a keynote speech.</li>
