    <p class="markdown">PyCon is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. PyCon is organized [by the Python community](/2016/about/ "") for the community. We try to keep registration far cheaper than most comparable technology conferences, to make PyCon accessible to the widest group possible. PyCon is a [diverse conference](/2016/about/diversity/ "") dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience to everyone. Our [code of conduct](/2016/about/code-of-conduct/ "") is intended to help everyone maintain the PyCon spirit. We thank all attendees and staff for observing it.
