<p>The fundamental misunderstanding here is in thinking that <code>range</code> is a generator. It's not. In fact, it's not any kind of iterator.</p>

<p>You can tell this pretty easily:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = range(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(list(a))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(list(a))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>If it were a generator, iterating it once would exhaust it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = my_crappy_range(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(list(b))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(list(b))
[]
</code></pre>

<p>What <code>range</code> actually is, is a sequence, just like a list. You can even test this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import collections.abc
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(a, collections.abc.Sequence)
True
</code></pre>

<p>This means it has to follow all the rules of being a sequence:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a[3]
3
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>The difference between a <code>range</code> and a <code>list</code> is that a <code>range</code> is a <em>lazy</em> or <em>dynamic</em> sequence; it doesn't remember all of its values, it just remembers its <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>step</code>, and creates the values on demand on <code>__getitem__</code>.</p>

<p>(As a side note, if you <code>print(iter(a))</code>, you'll notice that <code>range</code> uses the same <code>listiterator</code> type as <code>list</code>. How does that work? A <code>listiterator</code> doesn't use anything special about <code>list</code> except for the fact that it provides a C implementation of <code>__getitem__</code>, so it works fine for <code>range</code> too.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>Now, there's nothing that says that <code>Sequence.__contains__</code> has to be constant timeâ€”in fact, for obvious examples of sequences like <code>list</code>, it isn't. But there's nothing that says it <em>can't</em> be. And it's easier to implement <code>range.__contains__</code> to just check it mathematically (<code>(val - start) % step</code>, but with some extra complexity to deal with negative steps) than to actually generate and test all the values, so why <em>shouldn't</em> it do it the better way?</p>

<p>But there doesn't seem to be anything in the language that <em>guarantees</em> this will happen. As Ashwini Chaudhari points out, if you give it a non-integral value, instead of converting to integer and doing the mathematical test, it will fall back to iterating all the values and comparing them one by one. And just because CPython 3.2+ and PyPy 3.x versions happen to contain this optimization, and it's an obvious good idea and easy to do, there's no reason that IronPython or NewKickAssPython 3.x couldn't leave it out. (And in fact CPython 3.0-3.1 <em>didn't</em> include it.)</p>

<hr/>

<p>If <code>range</code> actually were a generator, like <code>my_crappy_range</code>, then it wouldn't make sense to test <code>__contains__</code> this way, or at least the way it makes sense wouldn't be obvious. If you'd already iterated the first 3 values, is <code>1</code> still <code>in</code> the generator? Should testing for <code>1</code> cause it to iterate and consume all the values up to <code>1</code> (or up to the first value <code>&gt;= 1</code>)?</p>
