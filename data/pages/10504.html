      <div class="plain"><pre>We are providing this code as-is. You are responsible for protecting yourself,
your property and data, and others from any risks caused by this code. This
code may cause unexpected and undesirable behavior to occur on your machine.
This code may not detect the vulnerability on your system.

Note that this POC consists of two components: server code and client code.
The server code triggers the vulnerability and therefore will crash the client
code. Note also that it is necessary to set the nameserver to point to the
server code, and doing so could cause other programs that call into the
getaddrinfo() function to crash while testing is underway. This POC code is
provided "as is" with no warranties, whether express or implied, including
without limitation any warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular
use and noninfringement. Google assumes no responsibility for your proper
installation and use of the POC code.
