<html><body><div><div class="comment-body"><p>I’ve been using IDEA since … version 2?  I can’t remember.  A long time.  Since then I have at different times purchased and used many of the JetBrains products.</p>
<p>During all the intervening years, I have believed the productivity argument that good tools often pay for themselves, and JetBrains tools (most of the time) meet the definition of “good” or even “best” tools.  I have debated long and hard with Eclipse fans — and users of Emacs, vi, you name it — and gotten companies I’ve consulted for over the years to buy licenses for whole teams.  I have done this not out of any particular favor for JetBrains, but because it is the best thing for my clients.</p>
<p>The debates with this subscription model that focus on pricing miss the point.  The pricing can always be tweaked, and we can assume that JetBrains will do so to maximize their income from these products, which (we hope, but I think likely) also means maximizing the number of people willing to pay.  If the prices are too high, that will work itself out.  And whether or not this represents a price increase is immaterial; prices could just as easily go up within the existing license model.</p>
<p>The deeper issue here is productivity, and risks to it.  Those debates about tools I’ve been through over the years have taught me how much inertia a development toolchain represents; getting people to change to IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs has never been a quick chat followed by a purchase, but rather a conversation that unfolded over several months: showing staff developers the tools, getting them over the humps that one faces with any new tool as well as the quirky ones specific to the JetBrains tools, and ultimately proving to them that the productivity boost is real and worth the investment, not just in licensing cost, but in developer time taken away from progress toward project goals.</p>
<p>The fact is that the cost of changing high-touch tools like IDEs is almost never small at team scale, and resistance to change comes from the foreknowledge that getting *out* of an untried IDE that ultimately doesn’t work out will be tough, particularly mid-project, and a significant hit to the timeline.  In other words, there is already a bit of feeling held hostage to this class of product, at least for managers of teams.  Free tools are (mostly) of lower quality, but they are inert, and not actively exploiting this already uncomfortable position of the development team.</p>
<p>Under the perpetual license model, to a customer it does not feel any more like active exploitation; it just feels like you’re paying more for a higher quality product.  If the quality is not there, you don’t buy — simple.</p>
<p>I understand that behind the scenes there is a dynamic where in order to ensure renewals you (JetBrains) end up batching improvements and new features, but this doesn’t risk customer access to already purchased features.  If it was good enough when the developer customers evaluated it, that will only change over time if the customer requirements change.  The decision can be made at a point in time, for a known cost, and both the price and the value received are constant from that point.</p>
<p>With the subscription/service model, that goes out the window.  Now, the ground can shift under us while our projects are in flight.  While we’re focused acutely on delivering, we now have to start thinking about: do I need to renew?  When?  Sure, the software starts to warn us if we forget, but is that early enough to get the next purchase through the potentially byzantine requisition process?  And, how long will that process take *this* time?  What if the price goes up?  What if the bean counters say no this time around?</p>
<p>And even if we plan for it, I’ve consulted for companies of all sizes, and I’ve never seen a company of any size with a purchasing process to which I would trust key elements of the team’s ability to deliver my project.  And forget about setting up a recurring purchase; the companies capable of such things invariably require all kinds of support arrangements and price guarantees, more than a dev manager can afford to worry about.</p>
<p>But to that point, more generally: business arrangements regarding critical functions usually involve contracts with mutual assurances.  This licensing model does not, as far as I can see, make any guarantees regarding the future delivery of services.  Yes, your licensing servers may crash at a critical moment, or you may go out of business, or you may simply decide that it is time to raise prices by some significant multiple.  You can give assurances that these things will not happen, and perhaps many developers will believe you; but I have encountered few legal departments or executives who would be comfortable with such assurances.  Are you prepared to enter into binding contracts with every corporate customer?  And even if you are, many will not want to take on *your* business risk on top of theirs.</p>
<p>And when you pile these risks on top of the already present feeling of being stuck with your IDE choice, at least for the duration of work in progress, I hope you can see why people are using phrases like “held hostage”.  It feels an awful lot like maneuvering customers into an even weaker bargaining position, for a benefit that seems to apply only to customers licensing many of your products per seat.</p>
<p>To some extent it doesn’t matter how you break down the different license options, with annual/monthly/hourly and kitchen-sink/a la carte; the fact is that having the risk of one’s most precious development tool ceasing to work hanging over one’s development effort is a non-starter.  Even if it is of lower quality, a tool that a team manager doesn’t need to worry about *during* a project is the one many will choose, because they simply already have too much to think about.  Team velocity is hard to increase, but by comparison easy to manage for; changing tools mid project is the kind of thing that is impossible to estimate, and really can’t be managed.</p>
<p>I would assume you have done some research about this before announcing this model, but perhaps the sampling of customers you surveyed was skewed toward some characteristics for which this model works.  I’m sure they’re out there, but I know they aren’t my clients.  Judging by the feedback, there are clearly very many for whom it will not.</p>
<p>Maybe the ones in favor of this model are numerous enough, despite their thin representation here, to sustain your business, in which case, good luck, but we must now part ways.  But if not, then there must be another way to solve whatever problem you guys think this solves, including raising prices if you must.  At least then there is still a conversation to be had about cost/benefit, and honestly, among my clients the price has rarely been an issue — your products have been generally reasonably priced, and within the reach of a productivity justification.  But the risk issue trumps price concerns handily; I think you could charge only $5/seat/year, and it would still be a non-starter because it puts business continuity at perpetual risk.</p>
<p>To be clear: IDEs are not like other development tools or other technologies like database engines.  Developers *live* in their development environments.</p>
<p>To take the metaphor further — this change is saying to the customer: we’ve been selling you apartments for a one time fee, and once every year or so you have been able to buy a new one from us for a discount, if you like, or you could just continue living in the old one, though it gradually falls out of date with current standards of living.</p>
<p>But now, we have a better deal!  Move into our new apartments, but instead of having to worry about *buying* them, you can just rent!  And we’ll maintain them while you live in them, for as long as you live in them!  It works out to be roughly the same cost as before, though some people will pay more or less than now, and the apartments are basically the same ones we’ve been selling you outright … but we hope this arrangement will make it possible to improve the quality of the apartments!</p>
<p>But in the fine print, we see that if we fail to make a rent payment, we have 30 days, and then we are automatically dumped, with all our stuff, on the street.  And that the automatic dump mechanism is wired to a deadman switch, so if the landlord (JetBrains) disappears, *everyone* gets evicted, and the apartments will just stand empty.</p>
<p>Would anyone *want* to live in such conditions?  Would anyone except the most risk-tolerant find this to be a good deal, when there is an endless supply of not terribly comfortable but completely and perpetually free apartments around the corner?</p>
