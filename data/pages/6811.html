<p>Right now, <code>count</code> feels like an arbitrary number, and it may seem like we're done. However, there is more! We need to consider all the different N that have some common multiples.</p>
<p>For example, if one <code>N</code> is 5, we count all of its multiples: 5, 10, <strong>15</strong>, 20...</p>
<p>If another <code>N</code> is 3, we count: 3, 6, 9, 12, <strong>15</strong>, 18...</p>
<p>This means that we're overcounting certain numbers, since they're multiples of different N. <em>And we're overcounting the multiples of these certain numbers too.</em> In this example, the number 30 is also counted in both lists. So is 45. This means that we need to find a list of the least common multiples between various <code>N</code> and we need to subtract them and their multiples from our <code>count</code>.</p>
<p>Computing all the LCMs for so many numbers however is going to be very computationally expensive again. A naive approach I tried ran for 30 mins straight without yielding any answer at all. So I started looking for patterns, and I found one.</p>
<p>It seems like the LCMs of all the combinations of prime multiples formed by choosing 4 primes out of 5 are the same. That sentence is a bit dense, so let's unpack it.</p>
<p>You have 5 primes as follows, and you create all the possible prime multiples you can by choosing 4 out of the 5.</p>
