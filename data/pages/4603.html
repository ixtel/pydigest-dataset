<h2>Interested in organizing DjangoCon Europe 2016?</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on May 18, 2015 </span>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://2015.djangocon.eu">DjangoCon Europe 2015</a> is just a few short weeks away - but we need to start planning for next year!</p>
<p>Each DjangoCon Europe event is run by a different volunteer organizing committee. That committee takes full financial responsibility for all aspects of the event: booking venues and catering, organizing any insurance that is required, finding speakers and sponsors, selling tickets and organizing swag. This usually involves the creation of a not-for-profit organization in the host country. Any profits from the event go back to that host organization to fund future Django activities in the host city.</p>
<p>The host city for DjangoCon Europe 2016 will hopefully be chosen and announced at this year's event. Anyone interested in hosting will be asked to make their pitch to a panel made up of past DjangoCon Europe organizers at this year's DjangoCon Europe. Based on those pitches, the panel will select the host for next year, and the Django Software Foundation will license the use of the "DjangoCon Europe 2016" name to that group.</p>
<p>At this time, we're looking for expressions of interest for hosting DjangoCon Europe 2016. If you're interested in hosting, you should also do some initial research so you're in a good position to pitch. The ideal pitch would be able to provide the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Key staff. Ideally, it won't be just yourself, but a core team of of 3-5 people who are willing to commit to the event. Past experience organising an event the size of DjangoCon Europe would be well regarded, but is not required.</li>
<li>Initial scoping of venues. We don't want you to sign contracts, but it would be good to have a short list in mind, know that those venues are available, have capacity, and are appropriately priced.</li>
<li>Indicative numbers on costs associated with flights, accommodation, food etc - i.e., what's the "all included" price likely to be for an attendee.</li>
<li>General information about the host city, any why it's an attractive venue.</li>
<li>Any grand ideas you have for how to make your event spectacular.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not in a position to provide all this information, that's fine - but the more you can provide, the better the chances for your pitch. At this point, none of the data you present would be "locked in" - we're not asking for final budgets, just evidence that you've done some initial research, have a realistic expectation of how much work is involved, and have a team that can make the event happen.</p>
<p>If you are interested in taking on the task of organizing DjangoCon Europe 2016, or if you'd like more information, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:foundation@djangoproject.com">please get in touch</a>.</p>
