<p>The Django core team is pleased to announce the addition of two new members.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jarshwah">Josh Smeaton</a> spent the better part of a year shepherding a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/f59fd15c4928caf3dfcbd50f6ab47be409a43b01">major patch</a> to the Django ORM to unify the representation of SQL expressions and allow much more flexible annotations and aggregations, and has been active in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/commits?author=jarshwah">other work</a> related to the ORM.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MarkusH">Markus Holtermann</a> was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/graphs/contributors?from=2014-01-01&amp;to=2015-01-09&amp;type=c">the most active non-core-team code contributor</a> to Django in 2014, with a particular focus on the new migrations system.</p>
<p>We thank Josh and Markus for their contributions, and look forward to their continued work to improve the Django project.</p>
