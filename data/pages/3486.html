Unfortunately the version bundled has at least these hugs if not more:<br/><br/>- cis files on windows don't work, installing a package from \\computer\directory\package will fail<br/><br/>- symbolic links in install target or /tmp locations, which seem to be prevalent on macos, result in incomplete installations when building binary modules<br/><br/>So you need to upgrade pip asap from the stock version: pip install --upgrade pip

Thanks for the info. I actually thought of doing that, and did it (the upgrade), though not for the reason you said. Anyway, good to know.<br/><br/><br/>
