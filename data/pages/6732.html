          <h2>Experiment</h2>
          <p>The interactive notebook format lets you try out Python
          code, get instant feedback, then tweak your code as many times as you need.
          Mix text and code to keep notes of what you're doing and organize
          your thoughts as you go.

          <h2>Visualize</h2>
          <p>Get immediate graphical feedback inside your notebook. Notebooks
          can include graphs, plots, images, sounds, 3D visualizations,
          and HTML. Use the built-in advanced Python libraries to make
          data visualization easy.

          <h2>Share</h2>
          <p>IPython notebooks are an open standard for sharing, publishing,
          and archiving computational work. Notebooks can be shared directly,
          or exported to HTML, PDF, Markdown, or commented pure Python.

          <h2>Standalone</h2>
          <p>Pineapple is a self-contained application that requires
          no other components to work. Installation is a simple
          drag-n-drop into your Applications folder. It will not
          interfere with any other installations of languages, libraries,
          or environments.

          <h2>Native</h2>
          <p>The classic IPython notebook interface uses a web
          browser for the user interface. Pineapple controls are native
          to the operating system for a consistent, integrated
          experience.

          <h2>Streamlined</h2>
          <p>Powerful enough for beginners, simple enough for advanced
          users.
          Many standard
          useful Python libraries included. Integrated help examples.
          Add libraries with a single command
          in your notebook, no need for the command line.
