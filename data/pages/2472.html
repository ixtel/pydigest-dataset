<html><body><div><div class="section" id="get-id">

<p>Retrieves paste or url redirect.</p>
<p>If a paste: returns the matching paste, verbatim and unmolested.</p>
<p>If a url redirect: returns HTTP code 301 with the location of the
redirect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="get-id-lexer">

<p>Like the above, but decodes and applies syntax highlighting to pastes
via HTML/CSS.</p>
<p>Line numbering and fragments are included, and can be used to link to
individual lines within the paste.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="post-handler">

<p>Run the request body through the handler and return the mangled output
in the response body--do not pass go, do not collect $200.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="post">

<p>Creates a new paste; returns GET URL and secret UUID.</p>
<p>Only multipart/form-data is supported; other content types are not
tested.</p>
<p>At least one 'name' disposition extension parameter must be present,
and its value must be 'c'.</p>
<p>If the 'p' form parameter exists and its value evaluates to true, the
paste will be a private paste where the paste can only be retrieved by
knowledge of its sha1 hexdigest.</p>
<p>Unless the 'filename' disposition extension parameter is specified,
the form data is decoded. The value of the 'filename' parameter is
split by period-delimited extension, and appended to the location in
the response.</p>
<p>If the 's' form parameter is specified, the paste
will be deleted after the given amount of time has passed. Its value
must be a positive integer and represents the number of seconds (after
having been pasted) that the paste should survive before being
automatically deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="post-vanity">

<p>Same as above, except the paste is a 'vanity' paste, where the GET URL
path is identical to the POST path.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="post-u">

<p>Creates a new url redirect (short url).</p>
<p>The form content will be decoded, and truncated at the first newline
or EOF, whichever comes first. The result of that is then returned in
a HTTP 301 response with the form content in the Location header.</p>
</div>
