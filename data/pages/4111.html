<p>Hello Py People!</p>
 
<p>In a continuation of our recent blog posts, we present to you our newest article dedicated to well known software and services based on Python.
In this roundup we've written about some popular services the community commented on in the previous article.</p>
 
<p>Let's start with a tech rockstar: Dropbox!</p>
 
<p><b>Dropbox</b></p><p>
</p><p>Dropbox is a file hosting service, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. Dropbox allows users to create a special folder on their computer which Dropbox synchronizes with their servers so the folder is accessible and up to date across multiple computers and via their web site and mobile app.</p>
<p>Originally, both the Dropbox server and desktop client software were primarily written in Python. From mid-2013 Dropbox began migrating its backend infrastructure to Go. The desktop client continues to use Python GUI toolkits such as wxWidgets and Cocoa along with a few notable Python libraries including Twisted, ctypes, and pywin32. While it uses Python to run some of its services, Dropbox also depends on the librsync binary-delta library, which is written in C.</p>

<p><b>Pinterest</b></p>
<p>Pinterest is a web and mobile application company, which operates an eponymous photo sharing website. Users can upload, save, sort, and manage images and other media content, known as pins, through collections known as pinboards. Pinterest uses Python with a heavily modified version of Django at the application layer. Tornado and node.js are used as web-servers.  Memcached and membase / redis for object- and logical-caching, respectively.  RabbitMQ as a message queue and so much more. You can find a breakdown of the internal structure for Pinterest here if you're curious: <a href="http://engineering.pinterest.com/post/65713073803/how-we-use-gevent-to-go-fast"> here's an article.</a></p>
