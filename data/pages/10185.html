<h2>KBOC16 Database</h2>
<p>This package contains the access API and descriptions for the <a href="#kboc16-database" rel="nofollow">KBOC16
Database</a>.</p>
<p>You would normally not install this package unless you are maintaining it. What
you would do instead is to tie it in at the package you need to <strong>use</strong> it.
There are a few ways to achieve this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can add this package as a requirement at the <tt>setup.py</tt> for your own
<a href="https://github.com/idiap/bob/wiki/Virtual-Work-Environments-with-Buildout" rel="nofollow">satellite package</a>
or to your Buildout <tt>.cfg</tt> file, if you prefer it that way. With this
method, this package gets automatically downloaded and installed on your
working environment, or</li>
<li>You can manually download and install this package using commands like
<tt>easy_install</tt> or <tt>pip</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The package is available in two different distribution formats:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can download it from <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi" rel="nofollow">PyPI</a>, or</li>
<li>You can download it in its source form from <a href="https://github.com/mgbarrero/bob.db.KBOC16" rel="nofollow">its git repository</a>. When you download the
version at the git repository, you will need to run a command to recreate
the backend SQLite file required for its operation. This means that the
database raw files must be installed somewhere in this case. With option
<tt>a</tt> you can run in <cite>dummy</cite> mode and only download the raw data files for
the database once you are happy with your setup.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can mix and match points 1/2 above based on your requirements. Here are
some examples:</p>
<div id="modify-your-setup-py-and-download-from-pypi">
<h3>Modify your setup.py and download from PyPI</h3>
<p>That is the easiest. Edit your <tt>setup.py</tt> in your satellite package and add
the following entry in the <tt>install_requires</tt> section (note: <tt>...</tt> means
<cite>whatever extra stuff you may have in-between</cite>, donâ€™t put that on your
script):</p>
<pre>install_requires=[
  ...
  "bob.db.kboc16",
],
</pre>
<p>Proceed normally with your <tt>boostrap/buildout</tt> steps and you should be all
set. That means you can now import the <tt>bob.db.kboc16</tt> namespace into your
scripts.</p>
</div>
<div id="modify-your-buildout-cfg-and-download-from-git">
<h3>Modify your buildout.cfg and download from git</h3>
<p>You will need to add a dependence to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer/" rel="nofollow">mr.developer</a> to be able to install from our
git repositories. Your <tt>buildout.cfg</tt> file should contain the following
lines:</p>
<pre>[buildout]
...
extensions =mr.developer
auto-checkout = *
eggs = ...
       bob.db.kboc16
