<p>What's <a class="reference external" href="http://bowerstatic.readthedocs.org">BowerStatic</a>? It's a little WSGI framework application for
Python that is easy to plug into any WSGI web framework. What you can
do with it is declare in Python code that you want some Bower package
included in the web page. It knows about dependencies and such. Like
<a class="reference external" href="http://fanstatic.org">Fanstatic</a> but for <a class="reference external" href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>.</p>

<p>I've released <a class="reference external" href="http://bowerstatic.readthedocs.org/en/0.4/changes.html">BowerStatic 0.4</a>. This fixes a bug and clears away
some technical debt that's been accumulating in BowerStatic for a
little while and was causing bugs. Goes to show that instead of doing
workarounds, be bold and refactor things a bit more heavily -- life
gets better and refactoring doesn't have to take a lot of time,
especially if you have proper automated tests.</p>
<p>BowerStatic has <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org">Morepath</a> integration in the form of <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/more.static">more.static</a>.</p>
