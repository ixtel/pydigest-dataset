<html><body><div><div id="watch-description-text" class=""><p id="eow-description">You can now run Python 3.4 on microcontrollers that cost less than a cup of coffee (in a up-market Parisian restaurant :)<br/><br/>MicroPython (<a href="http://www.micropython.org/" class="yt-uix-sessionlink  " data-sessionlink="ei=NKDVVs-_F8afYJCesMAO" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.micropython.org/</a>) is a very active port of Python 3 to low-end microcontrollers with minimal RAM (eg. 192k RAM, yes: "k", as in kilobytes) but lots of useful I/O.<br/><br/>Learn how to set up a very cheap microcontroller with wifi and a range of I/O and then program it with MicroPython.<br/><br/>The live demos are guaranteed to fail in spectacular ways as all live demos do, but will hopefully show enough blinking lights to tempt you to leave your i7 hyperthreaded clusters and join the cute but very practical world of cheap, embedded Python.<br/><br/>PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In 2015, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World. <br/><br/>July 31-August 4, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</p></div>  </div></body></html>
