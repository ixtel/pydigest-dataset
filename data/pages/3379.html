<p>So I feel like there is not a lot of good information out their on how to use Bayes Theorem for modeling – especially with Python code.  Like try figuring out how to understand a Bayesian Linear Regression from just Google searches – not super easy. So I thought I would maybe do a series of posts working up to Bayesian Linear regression.</p>
<p>The first post in this series is an introduction to Bayes Theorem with Python. I hope this post helps some understand what Bayes Theorem is and why it is useful. As well as get a small insight into how it differs from frequentist methods.</p>
<p>If anything isn’t clear or you have any comments, please let me know! Also, if you have any great Bayes resources, please share, and I can add them to the site.</p>
