<a name="UnderaweektogoclosesFriday8thMay"/><h3>Under a week to go - closes Friday 8th May</h3>
<p>With just under a week to go until the PyCon Australia 2015 Call for Proposals closes, we thought it would be a good idea to give everyone an update and a reminder. We’re very happy with the proposals we’ve already received, but we’re eager to receive more! We hope our proposal writing working bees in Brisbane have been of help, and hope to roll them out to more cities next year. If you’ve got any questions please get in touch (numerous contact details are up on <a href="http://pycon-au.org">pycon-au.org</a>). We would like to give a special shout out for the Education MiniConf, which is new this year: if you know people teaching and using computing in the education realm, please forward this CFP on.
</p><p>
The deadline for proposal submission is <b>Friday 8th May, 2015</b>.</p>

<a name="Conference"/><h3>Conference</h3><p>
The conference this year will be held on Saturday 1st and Sunday 2nd August 2015 in Brisbane. PyCon Australia attracts professional developers from all walks of life, including industry, government, and science, as well as enthusiast and student developers. We’re looking for proposals for presentations and tutorials on any aspect of Python programming, at all skill levels from novice to advanced.
Presentation subjects may range from reports on open source, academic or commercial projects; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program.
We're especially interested in short presentations that will teach conference-goers something new and useful. Can you show attendees how to use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an application?
</p><a name="Miniconfs"/><h3>Miniconfs</h3><p>
Four Miniconfs will be held on Friday 31st July, as a prelude to the main conference. Miniconfs are run by community members and are separate to the main conference. If you are a first time speaker, or your talk is targeted to a particular field, the Miniconfs might be a better fit than the main part of the conference. If your proposal is not selected for the main part of the conference, it may be selected for one of our Miniconfs:
</p><b>DjangoCon AU</b><p> is the annual conference of Django users in the Southern Hemisphere. It covers all aspects of web software development, from design to deployment - and, of course, the use of the Django framework itself. It provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the state of the art of web software development with other developers and designers.</p><p>
The </p><b>Python in Education Miniconf</b><p> aims to bring together community workshop organisers, professional Python instructors and professional educators across primary, secondary and tertiary levels to share their experiences and requirements, and identify areas of potential collaboration with each other and also with the broader Python community.</p><p>
The </p><b>Science and Data Miniconf</b><p> is a forum for people using Python to tackle problems in science and data analysis. It aims to cover commercial and research interests in applications of science, engineering, mathematics, finance, and data analysis using Python, including AI and 'big data' topics.</p><p>
The </p><b>OpenStack Miniconf</b><p> is dedicated to talks related to the OpenStack project and we welcome proposals of all kinds: technical, community, infrastructure or code talks/discussions; academic or commercial applications; or even tutorials and case studies. If a presentation is interesting and useful to the OpenStack community, it will be considered for inclusion. We also welcome talks that have been given previously in different events.
</p><a name="FirstTimeSpeakers"/><h3>First Time Speakers</h3>
<p>We welcome first-time speakers; we are a community conference and we are eager to hear about your experience. If you have friends or colleagues who have something valuable to contribute, twist their arms to tell us about it! Please also forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be interested.</p><p>
The most recent call for proposals information can always be found at: </p><a href="http://pycon-au.org/cfp">pycon-au.org/cfp</a><p>

See you in Brisbane in July!
