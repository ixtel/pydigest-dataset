          <p><a href="https://github.com/sciunto" class="user-mention">@sciunto</a> That 'ssh' fork will merge back into this one shortly, for what it's worth. It's also not Python3 compat yet, though there are patches.</p>

<p>Speaking personally, Python 3 support is a medium priority -- my hope is for Fabric 2.x to be Python 2.6=&gt;3.x compatible, and that will require doing the same for some Paramiko version.</p>

<p>For Fabric and my other projects, I'm hoping to go the "one codebase that works on both Python versions" approach. As mentioned above, I'm not sure if that is feasible for Paramiko due to it being bigger, more complex and more IO oriented. I also haven't experienced the joy/sadness of 2to3/3to2 yet -- if they work and don't make maintenance a huge pain, awesome. If not, hard to say what will happen.</p>
