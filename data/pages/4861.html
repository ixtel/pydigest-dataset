<p>Well it's been over a month since we launched <a href="https://github.com/yhat/rodeo">Rodeo</a>. 
It's been really exciting seeing how people have been using it and the sorts of features
they've been asking for. Lucky for them, we've been listening! Today we're
announcing the second major release of Rodeo.</p>
<p>We've added some great features for things like Spark, autocompletion, and 
enhancing the customization of the Rodeo UI. Hope you like them. </p>
<h3>Install / Upgrade</h3>
<p>First off, if you haven't already, go ahead and install/upgrade to the latest
version of Rodeo. You can do this using <code>pip</code>:</p>
<p><code>bash
$ pip install --upgrade rodeo</code></p>
<h3>Spark Integration</h3>
<p><a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html">PySpark</a> is all the rage
these days, so it was of little surprise when this was <a href="https://github.com/yhat/rodeo/pull/70">one of the first PR's</a> we got
on GitHub. Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jbencook">Ben Cook</a> from <a href="http://www.hudl.com/">Hudl</a> for submitting
this.</p>
<p>The Spark integration allows you to connect Rodeo to a Spark cluster. Configure
your Spark environment variables, (<code>SPARK_HOME</code>, <code>SPARK_OPTS</code>, <code>SPARK_LOG</code>), then fire up PySpark and then pass the <code>--pyspark</code> flag to the <code>rodeo</code> command.</p>

<h3>Resizeable panes</h3>
<p>One big feature request that we got from the initial launch was support for 
resizeable panes. We've added in the ability to resize the 4 panes that appear
in the UI. We've also made the app more responsive, so those of you with 
smaller screens will be able to enjoy Rodeo in it's full glory.</p>

<h3>Personalized Configs</h3>
<p>Another big gripe about Rodeo was that the font size was too big/small, 
or that the syntax highlighting wasn't quite right. To combat this
we've added a few configurable UI features: color scheme, font-size, and 
keyboard shortcuts (which includes VIM and Emacs modes).</p>

<h3>Autocomplete</h3>
<p>Another feature that's made a lot of progress is the autocomplete. Previously, 
Rodeo was using <a href="http://jedi.jedidjah.ch/en/latest/"><code>Jedi</code></a> which is a really
cool project, but it felt a little awkward since we were using the IPython
kernel for everything else.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../static/img/rodeo-autocomplete.png"/></p>
<p>We've switched over entirely to the IPython autocompleter and with it fixed some
UI defects regarding the autocompletion. What's really cool about this is that
by switching entirely over to IPython, we're now one step closer to being able
to <em>support languages other than Python</em>.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, the work for non-Python languages has largely been done by the 
great folks at the IPython project--we're just following in their footsteps. In 
the next release, we're going to roll out beta support for a new programing 
language! (exact language is still TBD)</p>

<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
<p>There's still a lot of work to be done, but the core of Rodeo is fairly stable.
In the coming releases, get ready for an improved UI, more configuration
options, and better support for server-side deployments.</p>
