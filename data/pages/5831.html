<p>Airport model and worldwide airport data for Django</p><p>








django-airports</p><p>===</p><p>### Airport model and worldwide airport data for Django</p><p>----</p><p>django-airports provides you with airport related model and data (from [OpenFlights](http://openflights.org/)) that can be used in your django projects.</p><p>Authored by [Basil Shubin](https://github.com/bashu) inspired by [django-cities](https://github.com/coderholic/django-cities)</p><p>[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-airports.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-airports/)</p><p>[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/django-airports.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-airports/)</p><p>[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/bashu/django-airports.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-airports/)</p><p>[![Code Health](https://landscape.io/github/bashu/django-airports/develop/landscape.svg?style=flat)](https://landscape.io/github/bashu/django-airports/develop)</p><p>----</p><p>### Requirements</p><p>You must have *django-cities* installed and configured, see the [django-cities documentation](https://github.com/coderholic/django-cities) for details and setup instructions.</p><p>### Setup</p><p>Either clone this repository into your project, or install with ```pip install django-airports```</p><p>You'll need to add ```airports``` to ```INSTALLED_APPS``` in your project's ```settings.py``` file:</p><p>```python</p><p>import django</p><p>INSTALLED_APPS = (</p><p>    ...</p><p>    'airports',</p><p>)</p><p>if django.VERSION &lt; (1, 7):</p><p>    INSTALLED_APPS += (</p><p>        'south',</p><p>    )</p><p>```</p><p>Then run ```./manage.py syncdb``` to create the required database tables, and ```./manage.py airports``` to import all of the airports data. **NOTE:** This can take some time.</p><p>Please see ``example`` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package. This also serves as a good example.</p><p>You need Django 1.4 or above to run that. It might run on older versions but that is not tested.</p><p>### Notes</p><p>The ```airports``` manage command has options, see ```airports --help``` output.  Verbosity is controlled through LOGGING.
