<h1>Django and Flask: Why and When To Use Which</h1>
</p>
<p>In this videoÂ <a href="https://www.hakkalabs.co/engineers/eric-schles">Eric Schles</a>, Dev evangelist at <a href="https://www.hakkalabs.co/companies/syncano">Syncano</a>, gives a compare and contrast talk on Django and Flask frameworks. Eric walks through some strengths of Flask: low overhead, easy to set up, good for prototyping etc., and some weaknesses: poor built-in debugging tools, not built to scale well, not strongly object-oriented. On the Django side of things, Eric points to strengths: object oriented, production level code under a deadline, and the benefits of the admin panel. However, Eric cautions viewers about the high overhead of set up and warns beginners about challenges.</p>
