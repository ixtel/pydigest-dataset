<html><body><div><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="text"><p>Imagine world where you can use all the webservices in the world via single
command. Here comes ws - single, generic command-line tool to access all kind of web services.</p>

<p>Add you service to ws service directory and let anyone use it without 
the need to create or deploy any software or installing anything beyond ws client.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring any api to the command line</li>
<li>Process local files with various cloud-based services</li>
<li>Try new services without installing any software (you'll need only ws client)</li>
<li>Learn just one tool</li>
<li>Use any mix of webservices and locally installed unix tools to slice, dice and filter your data,
combining them with no effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>$ ws example/cowsay say hello

 ------
&lt; hello &gt;
 -------
 \ ^__^
  \ (oo)\_______
    (__)\ )\/\
         ||----w |
         ||     ||

<p>Installation:</p>

<pre><code>You will need ws client. Its a simple python script, depending only on
requests library. You can install it from you distribution repository,
or use virtualenv to create local copy.

To get it in debian or ubuntu, run:
    sudo apt-get install python3-requests

Alternatively, you can set up virtualenv:

    sudo aptitude install virtualenv
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    ./venv/bin/pip install requests
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>./ws -h
./ws --help
./ws service_provider/service_name command options
./ws --file remotename localname service options

#note: remotename is a name under which file will be sent
while local name defines which your file will that be.
"-" as localname refers to standard input,
so you can pip through ws.
</code></pre>

<p>Creating your own service:</p>

<pre><code>You can find example service here:
https://github.com/Fiedzia/cow-as-as-service

Note that this is only an example. You can create your service
with any language or framework you choose,
as long as it speaks http.
The service needs to accept GET or POST request.
    Following parameters will be passed to the request:
            comand: name of the command
            You can define your commands and handle them however you want,
            but you should display list of supported cmmands and brief documentation
            when passed help command.

            arg - any number (possibly none) of additional arguments for command

    Its your service responsibility to validate parameters and return meaningfull and helpful
    message if they are wrong.


    Response:
        Return 200 response if you were able to parse command and its arguments,
        and you have data to return. Any output will be printed to standard output.

  Return 422 if a command or arguments are invalid.
</code></pre>

<p>Adding your service to service directory:</p>

<pre><code>See https://github.com/Fiedzia/servicedirectory.
Add simple json file and make a pull request,
and it should be soon added there.
