    <p>PlotDevice</p>
    <p class="small-print">A Python-based graphics language for<br/> designers, developers, and tinkerers</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>A Scriptable Graphics Factory</h1>
    <p>PlotDevice is a Macintosh application that lets you write Python scripts to generate
      2D graphics using simple drawing commands.

      <br/>  
      Under the hood, your code drives the system's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_2D">Quartz</a>
      imaging engine, giving your scripts the same graphical power as a full-fledged Cocoa app.
    </p>
    <p>Your code can combine basic geometric <a href="/tut/Primitives">shapes</a>, <a href="/ref/Typography#text()">typography</a>,
      freeform <a href="/tut/Bezier_Paths">Bézier</a> curves, and a panoply of
      <a href="/ref/Primitives.html#image()">image</a> formats. This omnivorousness makes PlotDevice ideal for
      both workaday tasks like image-processing as well as more exotic<br/> uses ranging from procedural
      texture generation to data visualization.</p>
    
    <hr/>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Write once, export everywhere</h1>
    <p>PlotDevice is more than just an updated version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)">Logo</a>. The graphics you create in the
      app can be exported to a variety of popular file-types.

      <br/>  
      In fact, without changing a single line of code, a script can <a href="/tut/Environment#export">generate</a> bitmaps
      (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, or GIF) or scalable vector images (PDF or EPS). Whether you're
      designing for print or screen, PlotDevice speaks your language.</p>

    <p>In addition to static images, your scripts can easily generate multi-frame <a href="/tut/Animation">animations</a>. Movies can be exported as H.264-encoded QuickTimes, animated GIFs, and even PDF ‘flipbooks’.

      <br/>  
      PlotDevice lets you focus on the design first and only worry about the production details
       as necessary.
    </p>

  </div>


  <div class="section">
    <h1>Draw with code</h1>
    <p>The application gives you everything you need to start writing programs that draw to a virtual canvas. It features a text editor with syntax highlighting and tab completion plus
      a zoomable graphics viewer and a variety of export options.

      <br/>  
      PlotDevice's simple but com­pre­hen­sive set of graphics commands will be familiar to users
      of similar graphics tools like <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Home">NodeBox</a> or <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>. And if you're new to programming,
      you'll find there's nothing better than being able to <span>see</span> the results of your
      code as you learn to think like a computer.
</p>
    
    <hr/>
  </div>


  <div class="section">
    <h1>Iterate and Automate</h1>
    <p>The scripts you write in PlotDevice are useful even outside of the app. You can use the
      included <a href="/tut/Console">command line tool</a> to run scripts and export images from
      the Terminal. The graphics routines can be imported from your own external Python scripts using
      the PlotDevice <a href="/tut/Console#standalone">module</a>,
      leaving your code in the driver's seat.
    </p>

    <p>PlotDevice also provides a form of <a href="/tut/Environment#clipboard">graphics sneakernet</a> using the clipboard. Within the
      app you can copy the graphical output as a PDF and paste it into the illustration program
      of your choice. This allows for semi-automated designs combining code-driven structure
      and handmade detailing.</p>
    
    <hr/>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Fully Documented</h1>
    <p>The PlotDevice <a href="manual#ref">Reference</a> describes the ins and outs of the drawing
     commands and datatypes available to your scripts. The entries discuss each command's syntax and
     demonstrate their use.</p>

    <p>Those looking for a more narrative walk through the API will want to dive into<br/> the
      <a href="/tut/Getting_Started">Tutorial</a> – a short book describing the PlotDevice
      drawing model and how to use it efficiently and expressively. </p>

    <p>Perhaps the best way to learn a new language is to look at sample code. The app comes
      with a slew of terrific scripts written by Tom De Smedt which are accessible from the
      “Examples” menu. </p>

        <h1>Family Tree</h1>

        <p>This project is a fork of the <a href="http://nodebox.net/code">NodeBox 1</a> application which was developed in the
        early oughts at the <a href="http://www.emrg.be">Experimental Media Research Group</a> in Antwerp and derived from an early version of DrawBot. Its original goals were
        twofold: offering a powerful graphics tool for Pythonistas and providing a learning environment for budding programmers.</p>

        <p>PlotDevice is an “existential refactor” of the NodeBox code, updating it to work with modern versions
         of Python and OS X and adding syntactic sugar as judiciously as possible. Its main code-level innovation
         is the use of the Python <code><a href="http://pd.local/tut/Graphics_State#with">with</a></code> statement to
         reversibly modify graphics state. Despite these changes, it maintains backward compatibility with all the original NodeBox commands.
        </p>

        <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

        <p>PlotDevice is primarily the work of <a href="http://samizdat.cc">Christian Swinehart</a>, with significant API-design contributions from <a href="http://studiosnack.net">Marcos Ojeda</a>.
           Special thanks to Alexander Bohn, Anselm Levskaya, and Adam Suharja for beta testing and essential feedback. Authors of the earlier projects in the app's lineage include:</p>

        <h1>Alternatives</h1>
        <p>PlotDevice is hardly the only app of its kind. It differs from similar projects in its focus on automation, expressiveness, and export quality over rendering speed or interactivity.
        If these trade-offs don’t match your project's use case, you still have a number of terrific packages to choose from:</p>

        <div class="see-also">
          <p class="nodebox icon"/>
          
          <p>The original inspiration for this project, NodeBox has gone in an interesting, <a href="http://cycling74.com">Max/MSP</a>-like
           direction in recent years and is now growing toward a <a href="https://maak.io">web based</a> future incarnation.</p>

          <p>A cross-platform implementation of the NodeBox API. Rendering is offloaded to the GPU for high-performance interactive graphics.</p>

          <p>NodeBox was originally a fork of this app which<br/> is currently enjoying a renaissance of active development. Its commands are similar to PlotDevice’s but hew closer to the underlying imaging model for a less “abstracted” experience.</p>

          <p>Ben Fry &amp; Casey Reas kicked off the current wave of programmatic-drawing environments
            with their release of Processing in 2001. In addition to being “the original”, it’s the most
            time-tested and has by far the largest community.</p>
