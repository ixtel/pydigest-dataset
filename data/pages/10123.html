<p>the django celery settings affects only workers running on the django server itself.</p>

<p>if all your workers are remote workers (the way as i do it), then on the sender side all you need is to put the configuration necessary to submit a task to the task queue.</p>

<p>and all the other settings need to be set on the remote workers.</p>

<p>and for the tasks, on the sender side, all i need to do is to define the task signature like this:</p>

<pre><code>@app.task(name='report_task')
def reportTask(self, link):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>then on the worker side, you need to create a new Celery app with the same name and pointing to the same broker; for other celery settings you need to declare them on the remote workers.</p>

<p>and implement the tasks logic on the remote workeres (you can have different tasks logic per worker as long as they have the same task name and the function arguments)</p>
