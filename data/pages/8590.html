<p><strong>SoundScrape</strong> makes it super easy to download artists from SoundCloud
(and Bandcamp and MixCloud) - even those which don’t have download
links! It automatically creates ID3 tags as well (including album art),
which is handy.</p>
<div id="usage">
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>First, install it:</p>
<pre>pip install soundscrape
</pre>
<p>Then, just call soundscrape and the name of the artist you want to
scrape:</p>
<pre>soundscrape rabbit-i-am
</pre>
<p>And you’re done! Hooray! Files are stored as mp3s in the format <strong>Artist
name - Track title.mp3</strong>.</p>
<p>You can also use the <em>-n</em> argument to only download a certain number of
songs.</p>
<pre>soundscrape rabbit-i-am -n 3
</pre>
</div>
<div id="sets">
<h3>Sets</h3>
<p>Soundscrape can also download sets, but you have to include the full URL
of the set you want to download:</p>
<pre>soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/vsauce-awesome/sets/awesome
</pre>
</div>
<div id="groups">
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>Soundscrape can also download tracks from SoundCloud groups with the
<em>-g</em> argument.</p>
<pre>soundscrape chopped-and-screwed -gn 2
</pre>
</div>
<div id="tracks">
<h3>Tracks</h3>
<p>Soundscrape can also download specific tracks with <em>-t</em>:</p>
<pre>soundscrape foolsgoldrecs -t danny-brown-dip
</pre>
<p>or with just the straight URL:</p>
<pre>soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/danny-brown-dip
</pre>
</div>
<div id="likes">
<h3>Likes</h3>
<p>Soundscrape can also download all of an Artist’s Liked items with <em>-l</em>:</p>
<pre>soundscrape troyboi -l
</pre>
<p>or with just the straight URL:</p>
<pre>soundscrape https://soundcloud.com/troyboi/likes
</pre>
</div>
<div id="high-quality-downloads-only">
<h3>High-Quality Downloads Only</h3>
<p>By default, SoundScrape will try to rip everything it can. However, if
you only want to download tracks that have an official download
available (which are typically at a higher-quality 320kbps bitrate), you
can use the <em>-d</em> argument.</p>
<pre>soundscrape sly-dogg -d
</pre>
</div>
<div id="folders">
<h3>Folders</h3>
<p>By default, SoundScrape aims to act like <em>wget</em>, downloading in place in
the current directory. With the <em>-f</em> argument, however, SoundScrape acts
more like a download manager and sorts songs into the following format:</p>
<pre>./ARTIST_NAME - ALBUM_NAME/SONG_NUMBER - SONG_TITLE.mp3
</pre>
<p>It will also skip previously downloaded tracks.</p>
<pre>soundscrape murdercitydevils -f
</pre>
</div>
<div id="bandcamp">
<h3>Bandcamp</h3>
<p>SoundScrape can also pull down albums from Bandcamp. For Bandcamp pages,
use the <em>-b</em> argument along with an artist’s username or a specific URL.
It only downloads one album at a time. This works with all of the other
arguments, except <em>-d</em> as Bandcamp streams only come at one bitrate, as
far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Note: Currently, when using the <em>-n</em> argument, the limit is evaluated
for each album separately.</p>
<pre>soundscrape warsaw -b -f
</pre>
</div>
<div id="mixcloud">
<h3>Mixcloud</h3>
<p>SoundScrape can also grab mixes from Mixcloud. This feature is extremely
expermental and is in no way guaranteed to work!</p>
<p>Finds the original mp3 of a mix and grabs that (with tags and album art)
if it can, or else just gets the raw m4a stream.</p>
<p>Mixcloud currently only takes an invidiual mix. Capacity for a whole
artist’s profile due shortly.</p>
<pre>soundscrape https://www.mixcloud.com/corenewsuploads/flume-essential-mix-2015-10-03/ -of
</pre>
</div>
<div id="audiomack">
<h3>Audiomack</h3>
<p>Just for fun, SoundCloud can also download individual songs from
Audiomack. Not that you’d ever want to.</p>
<pre>soundscrape -a http://www.audiomack.com/song/bottomfeedermusic/top-shottas
</pre>
</div>
<div id="opening-files">
<h3>Opening Files</h3>
<p>As a convenience method, SoundScrape can automatically <em>‘open’</em> files
that it downloads. This uses your system’s ‘open’ command for file
associations.</p>
<pre>soundscrape lorn -of
</pre>
</div>
<div id="issues">
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>There’s probably a lot more that can be done to improve this. Please
file issues if you find them!</p>
