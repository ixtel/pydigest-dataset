IPython notebooks are great for many things, but they're a little awkward to embed in blog post platforms like Blogger, Wordpress, etc. When the nbconvert feature was a standalone command-line tool, there was a blog export template, but that seems to have disappeared now that nbconvert has been folded within IPython.</p>
<p>
Out of the box, nbconvert just has two html export options:
</p><ul>
<li><pre>--html</pre>which includes a lot of CSS that interferes with a blog's CSS, and:</li>
<li><pre>--html --template basic</pre>which has no CSS and so pretty much negates the benefit of using an IPython notebook. However, it does have CSS classess in the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>
My solution was to whip up a quick CSS stylesheet that could be included in the blog post. It seems to work pretty well; you can have a look at:
</p>
<div><p>
Note that, for aesthetic reasons, I removed all the </p><pre>In [1]</pre><p>-style tags because of the narrow columns on this blog. Your mileage may vary.</p></div>
<p>
<br/></p>

<h2>
1. Convert .ipynb notebook to HTML</h2>
<p>
In the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the .ipynb file and type:

</p><pre>ipython nbconvert --to html --template basic filename.ipynb</pre>

<h2>
2. Paste HTML in blog</h2>
<p>
Note: if you're using the Blogger platform, never switch back to the Compose interface after you use the HTML interface, it changes all your tags.

</p><h2>
3. Add CSS to blog HTML</h2>
<p>
This seems to reproduce the native syntax highlighting of IPython.

</p><pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
