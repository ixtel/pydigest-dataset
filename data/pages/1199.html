<p>This is to inform you about the new stable release of <a class="reference external" href="http://nuitka.net">Nuitka</a>. It is the extremely compatible Python compiler. Please see the page <a class="reference external" href="../pages/overview.html">"What is Nuitka?"</a> for an overview.</p>
<p>This release is aiming at preparatory changes to enable optimization based
on SSA analysis, introducing a variable registry, so that variables no longer
trace their references to themselves.</p>
<p>Otherwise, MinGW64 support has been added, and lots of bug fixes were made to
improve the compatibility.</p>
<div class="section" id="new-optimization">
<h2>New Optimization</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using new variable registry, now properly detecting actual need for sharing
variables. Optimization may discover that it is unnecessary to share a
variable, and then it no longer is. This also allows <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--debug</span></tt> without it
reporting unused variable warnings on Python3.</li>
<li>Scons startup has been accelerated, removing scans for unused tools, and
avoiding making more than one gcc version check.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-fixes">
<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Compatibility: In case of unknown encodings, Nuitka was not giving the name
of the problematic encoding in the error message. Fixed in 0.5.3.3 already.</li>
<li>Submodules with the same name as built-in modules were wrongly shadowed.
Fixed in 0.5.3.2 already.</li>
<li>Python3: Added implementations of <tt class="docutils literal">is_package</tt> to the meta path based
loader.</li>
<li>Python3.4: Added <tt class="docutils literal">find_spec</tt> implementation to the meta path based loader
for increased compatibility.</li>
<li>Python3: Corrections for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--debug</span></tt> to work with Python3 and MSVC compiler
more often.</li>
<li>Fixed crash with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--show-scons</span></tt> when no compiler was found. Fixed in 0.5.3.5
already.</li>
<li>Standalone: Need to blacklist <tt class="docutils literal">lib2to3</tt> from standard library as well. Fixed
in 0.5.3.4 already.</li>
<li>Python3: Adapted to changes in <tt class="docutils literal">SyntaxError</tt> on newer Python releases, there
is now a <tt class="docutils literal">msg</tt> that can override <tt class="docutils literal">reason</tt>.</li>
<li>Standalone Windows: Preserve <tt class="docutils literal">sys.executable</tt> as it might be used to fork
binaries.</li>
<li>Windows: The caching of Scons was not arch specific, and files could be
used again, even if changing the arch from <tt class="docutils literal">`x86</tt> to <tt class="docutils literal">x86_64</tt> or
back.</li>
<li>Windows: On 32 bit Python it can happen that with large number of generators
running concurrently (&gt;1500), one cannot be started anymore. Raising an
<tt class="docutils literal">MemoryError</tt> now.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="organizational">
<h2>Organizational</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added support for MinGW64. Currently needs to be run with <tt class="docutils literal">PATH</tt> environment
properly set up.</li>
<li>Updated internal version of Scons to 2.3.2, which breaks support for VS 2008,
but adds support for VS 2013 and VS 2012. The VS 2013 is now the recommended
compiler.</li>
<li>Added RPM package and repository for RHEL 7.</li>
<li>The output of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--show-scons</span></tt> now includes the used compiler, including the
MSVC version.</li>
<li>Added option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--msvc</span></tt> to select the MSVC compiler version to use, which
overrides automatic selection of the latest.</li>
<li>Added option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-python-flag=no_warnings</span></tt> to disable user and deprecation
warnings at run time.</li>
<li>Repository for Ubuntu Raring was removed, no more supported by Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cleanups">
<h2>Cleanups</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Made technical and logical sharing decisions separate functions and implement
them in a dedicated variable registry.</li>
<li>The Scons file has seen a major cleanup.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This release is mostly a maintenance release. The Scons integrations has been
heavily visited, as has been Python3 and esp. Python3.4 compatibility, and
results from the now possible debug test runs.</p>
<p>Standalone should be even more practical now, and MinGW64 is an option for those
cases, where MSVC is too slow.</p>
