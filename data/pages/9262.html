<p>Hello Pythoneers!</p>
<p><b>Kojo Idrissa</b> will lead us through an introduction to testing your Python code: "What is software testing? Why should you do it? How can you do it? These questions, and possibly others, will be answered! This talk will be aimed at new programmers and MAYBE experienced programmers who're new to testing." <br/></p> 
<p><span>NEW LOCATION: Our meetup is located at the </span><strong>Black Labrador Pub</strong><span>, near Richmond and Montrose. Please enjoy their menu and drink offerings, so they continue to enjoy hosting us! Lastly, </span><strong>please RSVP</strong><span> (even if you're a "Maybe"!) to assist us with capacity planning.</span> <br/></p>
<p><strong>Share your Lightning Talks!</strong> A "lightning talk" is a quick mini-presentation (5 minutes maximum) on any Python topic you'd like. Â We'll save time for 2-3 of these each month: to save a spot, post a comment with your talk's title/topic. Beginner topics are always welcome!</p>
<p><strong>Presentations Wanted:</strong> If you'd like to share a topic with the group at an upcoming, let's talk!</p>
