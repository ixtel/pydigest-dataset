I've been working with David Whale (</p><a href="http://blog.whaleygeek.co.uk/">blog.whaleygeek.co.uk</a><p>) since February writing a book called "Adventures in Minecraft" and today it started arriving through people's doors!
</p><p>
It's a book written especially for 11-15 year old's and its a fun way to not only get into programming using </p><a href="http://python.org/">Python</a><p> but also learn how to do amazing things with Minecraft. 
</p><p>
All the adventures, projects and programs in the book work with </p><a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a><p> on the PC and Apple Mac as well as </p><a href="http://pi.minecraft.net/">Minecraft: Pi Edition</a><p> on the </p><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a><p>.

</p>
<p>
I have created a </p><a href="http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/adventures-in-minecraft.html">small mini site</a><p>, including a </p><a href="http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/adventures-in-minecraft-forum.html">forum</a><p> for the readers of the book to come together get support, share ideas and I personally can't wait to see the projects you create.
</p><p>
Its available from </p><a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111894691X.html">Wiley</a><p>, Amazon (</p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/111894691X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=111894691X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stuabocod-21">UK</a><p>, </p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/111894691X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=111894691X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stuabocod-20&amp;linkId=V56BNBRN5NXWF3TG">US</a><p>) and loads of other book stockists.

Minecraft programming experts David Whale and Martin O′Hanlon walk you step–by–step through everything you need to know to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get started writing Minecraft programs in Python on your PC, Mac, or Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Build houses and other structures in the blink of an eye, and make a 3D duplicating machine</li>
<li>Write interactive games like a field that charges you rent, and a treasure hunt using magic vanishing bridges</li>
<li>Build custom game control panels using simple electronic circuits</li>
<li>Easily build huge 2D and 3D structures such as spheres and pyramids</li>
<li>Build intelligent objects like a massive Minecraft clock, and program an alien invasion</li>
<li>Plan and write a complete interactive arena game</li>
</ul><p>
Using the programming skills you learn from this book, writing Minecraft programs offers endless possibilities to create anything you can imagine.
</p><p>
To make your journey that much easier, the Adventures in Minecraft companion website, </p><a href="http://wiley.com/go/adventuresinminecraft">wiley.com/go/adventuresinminecraft</a><p> supplies you with a video for each adventure in the book, downloadable code files, helpful programming reference tables, a bonus adventure, and badges to collect for your Minecraft accomplishments.</p></div>

Myself and David are really proud of what we have created and think it really is a great way to get into creating your own Minecraft mods, tools and games.
