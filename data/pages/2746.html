<p>If you're not familiar with the problem yet, have a look at the comic below.</p>  <p><a href="http://xkcd.com/936/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png"/></a></p>  <p>Come along <a href="https://github.com/redacted">redacted</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/redacted/XKCD-password-generator">XKCD-password-generator</a> which turns this into a Python-module reality for us to easily plug into our code.</p>  <code class="brush: bash;">pip install xkcdpass </code>  <p>And in your code:</p>  <code class="brush: py;"> from xkcdpass import xkcd_password<br/> <br/> wordfile = xkcd_password.locate_wordfile()<br/> mywords = xkcd_password.generate_wordlist(wordfile=wordfile)<br/> random_password = xkcd_password.generate_xkcdpassword(mywords, n_words = 3, delim='.') </code>  <p>This is all fine and very easy to use. However, there is a small catch.</p>  <h4>priest.fucking.choirboy</h4>  <p>Believe it or not, this is a combination that is possible with the default dictionary. </p>  <p>By using the default password file supplied by <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/">12Dicts</a> in the function <strong>locate_wordfile()</strong>, you are potentially including swear words and religious references. The potential mix of these and regular words CAN be offensive, especially when you're automatically generating these for users and sending them out blindly.</p>  <p>Depending on how this code is used, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting">the recent events at Charlie Hebdo's office in Paris</a> is a good motivation to make sure watch your words.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-j67hC9hbQMU/VLXtsgHd7zI/AAAAAAAAETU/XxnRGGNggK0/s1600-h/belldem%25255B4%25255D.jpg"><img title="belldem" border="0" alt="belldem" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-tmUP5-b7D6Q/VLXtttqcInI/AAAAAAAAETc/KlDA4QlxETM/belldem_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800"/></a>Â  <br/><font>When random words suddenly have meaning...</font></p>  <h4>Here's one I prepared earlier</h4>  <p>I spent about 2 days scanning the file for potentially offensive words. I've taken out as many words as I could relating to the following categories:</p>  <ul>   <li>religion </li>    <li>swearing </li>    <li>sex and sexual connotations </li>    <li>drugs </li>    <li>health and/or disease related words </li>    <li>violence </li>    <li>names of people or countries </li> </ul>  <p>Since it was a horribly mundane task, I'm sure I've missed some. If you find some, please let me know by leaving a comment below.</p>  <p>For those inclined to download and run, you can grab a <a href="https://github.com/twig/twigstechtips-snippets/tree/master/xkcd-password-generator">cleansed password file from github</a>.</p>  <p>Then fix the code to use your own file:</p>  <code class="brush: py;"> from xkcdpass import xkcd_password<br/> <br/> wordfile = "users/passwords.txt" # Previously xkcd_password.locate_wordfile()<br/> mywords = xkcd_password.generate_wordlist(wordfile=wordfile)<br/> random_password = xkcd_password.generate_xkcdpassword(mywords, n_words = 3, delim='.') </code>  <p>I've provided a patch/diff file for the words I've removed.</p>    <h4>Sources</h4>
