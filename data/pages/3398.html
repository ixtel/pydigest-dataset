<p>This article went through a series of changes!</p>
<p>I was initially writing on a different topic (related to analytics). I had almost finished writing it. I had put in about 2 hours and written an average article. If I had made it live, it would have done OK! But something in me stopped me from making it live. I was just not satisfied with the output. The article didn’t convey how I am feeling about 2015 and how useful Analytics Vidhya could become for your analytics learning this year.</p>
<p>So, I put that article in Trash and started re-thinking which topic would do the justice. This is what I ended up with – let me write awesome articles and guides about what was my biggest learning in 2014 – The Scikit-learn library in Python. This was my biggest learning because it is now the tool I use for any machine learning project I work upon.</p>
<p>Creating these articles would not only be immensely useful for readers of the blog, but would also challenge me in writing about something I am still relatively new at. I would also love to hear from you on the same – what was your biggest learning in 2014 and would you want to share it with readers of this blog?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is scikit-learn?</strong></h3>
<p>Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python. It is on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib, this library contains a lot of effiecient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.</p>
<p>Please note that scikit-learn is used to build models. It should not be used for reading the data, manipulating and summarizing it. There are better libraries for that (e.g. NumPy, Pandas etc.)</p>

<h3><strong>Components of scikit-learn:</strong></h3>
<p>Scikit-learn comes loaded with a lot of features. Here are a few of them to help you understand the spread:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervised learning algorithms:</strong> Think of any supervised learning algorithm you might have heard about and there is a very high chance that it is part of scikit-learn. Starting from Generalized linear models (e.g Linear Regression), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees to Bayesian methods – all of them are part of scikit-learn toolbox. The spread of algorithms is one of the big reasons for high usage of scikit-learn. I started using scikit to solve supervised learning problems and would recommend that to people new to scikit / machine learning as well.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-validation:</strong> There are various methods to check the accuracy of supervised models on unseen data</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised learning algorithms:</strong> Again there is a large spread of algorithms in the offering – starting from clustering, factor analysis, principal component analysis to unsupervised neural networks.</li>
<li><strong>Various toy datasets:</strong> This came in handy while learning scikit-learn. I had learnt SAS using various academic datasets (e.g. IRIS dataset, Boston House prices dataset). Having them handy while learning a new library helped a lot.</li>
<li><strong>Feature extraction:</strong> Useful for extracting features from images and text (e.g. Bag of words)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Community / Organizations using scikit-learn:</strong></h3>
<p>One of the main reasons behind using open source tools is the huge community it has. Same is true for scikit-learn ass well. There are about 35 contributors to scikit learn till date, the most notable being Andreas Mueller (P.S. Andy’s <a href="http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.in/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html" target="_blank">machine learning cheat sheet</a> is one of the best visualizations to understand the spectrum of machine learning algorithms).</p>
<p>There are various Organiations of the likes of Evernote, Inria and AWeber which are being displayed on <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html" target="_blank">scikit learn home page</a> as users. But I truly believe that the actual usage is far more.</p>
<p>In addition to these communities, there are various meetups across the globe. There was also a <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-london-scikit-learn" target="_blank">Kaggle knowledge contest</a>, which finished recently but might still be one of the best places to start playing around with the library.</p>

<h3><strong>Quick Example:</strong></h3>
<p>Now that you understand the eco-system at a high level, let me illustrate the use of scikit learn with an example. The idea is to just illustrate the simplicity of usage of scikit-learn. We will have a look at various algorithms and best ways to use them in one of the articles which follow.</p>
<p>We will build a logistic regression on IRIS dataset:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the relevant libraries and read the dataset</strong></p>
<div id="stb-container-1133" class="stb-container-css stb-grey-container stb-image-none stb-ltr stb-corners stb-side-none"><aside class="stb-icon"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp-special-textboxes/images/gears-b.png" data-recalc-dims="1"/></aside><div id="stb-box-1133" class="stb-grey_box stb-box">
<p>import numpy as np</p>
<p>import matplotlib as plt</p>
<p>from sklearn import datasets</p>
<p>from sklearn import metrics</p>
<p>from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression</p>
</div></div>
<p>We have imported all the libraries. Next, we read the dataset:</p>
<div id="stb-container-3144" class="stb-container-css stb-grey-container stb-image-none stb-ltr stb-corners stb-side-none"><aside class="stb-icon"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp-special-textboxes/images/gears-b.png" data-recalc-dims="1"/></aside><div id="stb-box-3144" class="stb-grey_box stb-box">
<p>dataset = datasets.load_iris()</p>
</div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Understand the dataset by looking at distributions and plots</strong></p>
<p>I am skipping these steps for now. You can read <a title="Baby steps in Python – Exploratory analysis in Python (using Pandas)" href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/08/baby-steps-python-performing-exploratory-analysis-python/" target="_blank">this article, if you want to learn exploratory analysis</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Build a logistic regression model on the dataset and making predictions</strong></p>
<div id="stb-container-8772" class="stb-container-css stb-grey-container stb-image-none stb-ltr stb-corners stb-side-none"><aside class="stb-icon"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp-special-textboxes/images/gears-b.png" data-recalc-dims="1"/></aside><div id="stb-box-8772" class="stb-grey_box stb-box">
<p>model.fit(dataset.data, dataset.target)</p>
<p>expected = dataset.target</p>
<p>predicted = model.predict(dataset.data)</p>
</div></div>
<p><strong>Step 4: Print confusion metrix</strong></p>
<div id="stb-container-7208" class="stb-container-css stb-grey-container stb-image-none stb-ltr stb-corners stb-side-none"><aside class="stb-icon"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp-special-textboxes/images/gears-b.png" data-recalc-dims="1"/></aside><div id="stb-box-7208" class="stb-grey_box stb-box">
<p>print(metrics.classification_report(expected, predicted))</p>
<p>print(metrics.confusion_matrix(expected, predicted))</p>
</div></div>
<p> </p>
