<p>I recently saw a poll on <em>/r/Python</em>, about how many people used IDLE, which is sort of the default IDE Python comes with. I used IDLE for a long time, but its shortcomings start to catch up with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing up moves the cursor up, and doesn’t run the last instruction (which is the default behaviour on most command lines)</li>
<li>Working with files/directories on your disk is a nightmare (you have to use horrible ways like <em>os.get_cwd</em> or <em>os.chdir</em>).</li>
<li>The GUI is ugly. Real ugly</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are other IDEs, many require you to spend six hours creating a project, when all you want to do is run 5 lines of code.</p>
<p>I discovered IPython by mistake, and ignored it at first. This is because unlike other IDEs, there aren’t people shouting <em>OMG! IPython is the bes</em>t. Well, it’s time to change that.</p>
<p><strong>OMG! IPython is the Best</strong></p>
<p>IPython is really slick, with a lot of cool features. We’ll only go over a few of them. My goal is to convince you to dump IDLE for IPython.</p>
<p>IPython comes in two flavors: QT Console which runs as a desktop app, and Notebook, which runs as a web service. Let’s looks at QT Console first:</p>
<p><strong>Code completion</strong></p>
<p>If you import a library, say Pandas, and forget which function reads a csv file, pressing <em>tab</em> will give you all possible choices:</p>

<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy2.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1575"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1579" src="//i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy2.png?resize=250%2C98" alt="ipy2" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Great directory/file access</strong></p>
<p>IPython supports most Linux commands, so you can run commands like cd, pwd, ls etc. It makes changing directories, looking up files so easy:</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy3.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1575"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1580" src="//i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy3.png?resize=408%2C395" alt="ipy3" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy3.png?resize=300%2C290 300w, http://i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy3.png?w=408 408w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>In the example above, I do a <em>pwd</em>, then list all files in the directory using <em>ls</em>, then finally change my directory with <em>cd</em>. Try doing that with IDLE.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Magic features</strong></p>
<p>Another cool feature is that IPython comes with many magic features. These allow you to do things like change directories, which we saw above.</p>
<p>We can also run any Python script from within IPython using <em>%run</em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy4.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1575"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1576" src="//i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy4.png?resize=553%2C413" alt="ipy4" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy4.png?resize=300%2C224 300w, http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy4.png?w=553 553w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>What if you want to run other system commands? Simple, run them by adding a <em>!</em> to the front. Here is me getting info about my Windows system (by running Windows specific commands):</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy7.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1575"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1582" src="//i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy7.png?resize=739%2C510" alt="ipy7" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy7.png?resize=300%2C207 300w, http://i2.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy7.png?w=739 739w" sizes="(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>What if you want to see which variables you have defined?</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy6.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1575"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1581" src="//i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy6.png?resize=593%2C220" alt="ipy6" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy6.png?resize=300%2C111 300w, http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy6.png?w=593 593w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>Or embed your graphs directly within IPython:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy5.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1575"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1577" src="//i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy5.png?resize=476%2C531" alt="ipy5" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy5.png?resize=269%2C300 269w, http://i1.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy5.png?w=476 476w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>There are hundreds of magic commands for everything and anything you could need.</p>
<p><strong>IPython Notebook</strong></p>
<p>The IPython Notebook is another feature that blows you out of the water the first time you use it. It’s power is that you can mix code with Markdown/Latex formatted code. Which means that if you write tutorials, you no longer have to switch between text and code (and neither do your students). Everything is in one place:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy8.png" class="grouped_elements" rel="tc-fancybox-group1575"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1584" src="//i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy8.png?resize=1024%2C831" alt="ipy8" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy8.png?resize=300%2C243 300w, http://i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy8.png?resize=1024%2C831 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/pythonforengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ipy8.png?w=1204 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>Let that sink in for a moment. You can read a tutorial, and run the code, <em>right in the tutorial itself</em>, without having to open another window/shell.</p>
<p>If you change your tutorial, your code gets automatically updated, as they are in the same place.</p>
<p>And not only that, you can share your IPython Notebook as a HTML, Markdown, Rst, and in newer versions, PDF as well.</p>
<p><strong>The future</strong></p>
<p>IPython has evolved into the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter </a>project, which takes IPython and extends it to other languages like R and Julia (for now).</p>
<p>I am waiting for the time when someone writes an entire book purely in IPython. There are a few problems at the moment, but if you know someone who has done this, or trying to do it, please let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Updated based on reader feedback</strong></p>
<p>Ipython can also be run in a pure shell mode. Thanks to Denilson and Simon for pointing that out. Here is an online demo: <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">https://www.python.org/shell/</a></p>
<p>And as <cite class="fn">Rachel Thomas</cite> points out, there are several books written in Ipython! <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#entire-books-or-other-large-collections-of-notebooks-on-a-topic">Here is a selection</a>.</p><p>
PS: Want a </p><strong>free</strong><p> 1+ hour </p><strong>video</strong> <strong>course</strong><p>,</p><em> Introduction to Web Scraping and Data Analysis</em><p>?
Also get a </p><strong>free</strong><p> mini-book,</p><em> Python: From Apprentice to Master.</em>
