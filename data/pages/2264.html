<p>I want to create a new module for myself but I also want some colleagues to be able to use it. I started writing my docstrings in English but then I realized that it will make the module useless for some of them who are not good understanding this language. </p>

<p>My first idea was to type both English and, on the same docstring, Spanish. But this doesn't seem right, what if I want some Russian friends to use it too? What if I've got friends who have friends all over the world who don't have any common language to read docs in?</p>

<p>What's the easiest way to write and then read docstrings in multiple languages? </p>
