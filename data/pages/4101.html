PyDev just reached version 4.0 --- after 11+ years that's not so much, is it? ;)</p>
<p>
The major improvement in this release is that PyDev can now unpack compound types when doing code-completion (i.e.: </p><b>list(str), dict(int:str)</b><p>, etc).
</p><p>
The screenshot below shows a completion unpacking types by analyzing the current scope:

</p>

<p>
The second example shows a completion unpacking types by analyzing a docstring (see: </p><a href="http://pydev.org/manual_adv_type_hints.html">http://pydev.org/manual_adv_type_hints.html</a><p> for more details on the formats supported).

</p>

<p>
This release also enables </p><b>Unicode literals and Byte literals to have different colors</b><p>, so, it's easy to spot what you're working with (and it should respect the semantics of Python 2 </p><i>from __future__ import unicode_literals</i><p> and Python 3).
</p><p>
Another nice feature for those that work more in the interactive side of Python is that PyDev now allows users to define a template to send a custom command to the interactive console.
</p><p>
PyDev already has an </p><b>F2</b><p> binding which sends a line to the console, but let's say that you do something else a lot in the console (such as </p><b>plot(variable)</b><p>). With this feature you can bind something as </p><b>Ctrl+F2</b><p> to send the selected text as </p><b>plot(${text})</b><p> to the console (the screenshot below shows how that configuration would be achieved).

</p>

<p>
Also, the PyDev update site is now hosted on </p><a href="http://bintray.com/">http://bintray.com</a><p> -- note that the update site urls didn't change, so, this change should (hopefully) be imperceptible to end-users...
</p><p>
There are also other nice things (see </p><a href="http://pydev.org/">http://pydev.org</a><p> for more details).
</p><p>
To finish, a special thanks to all the </p><a href="https://sw-brainwy.rhcloud.com/supporters/PyDev/">PyDev supporters</a><p> (it definitely wouldn't be possible without your help -- for those that want to help supporting it, please access the related links at </p><a href="http://pydev.org/">http://pydev.org</a><p>).
