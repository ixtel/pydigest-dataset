<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Twitter started the trend of ‘People to Follow’. This later got replicated by other platforms such as Facebook, Linkedin, Quora and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>. This cool feature lets you connect with the rockstars of various domains and get an access to what is going on their end without bothering them much. For the influencers, this has become an effective way to communicate with their followers.</p>
<p>The lives of people on GitHub doesn’t appear to as tempting as you would observe on other platforms, but if you love coding, programming and data science, you’ll surely enjoy the company of 9 million users on this platform!</p>
<p>Following influencers is usually a good practice. It has helped me in multiple ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever I run out of inspiration, I look at these influencers and see what they have achieved. This brings back the energy and I am back on my projects</li>
<li>You can follow these influencers to see which events are they attending, what are they reading and what are they working on. This can quickly become a wealth of knowledge in itself.</li>
<li>To some extent, it also provides a human touch to these influencers. By just looking at their profiles, they might come across as some one out of the world. But, when you start folllowing them regularly, you tend to relate yourself with the influencers.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you haven’t tried this yet, it’s your turn now. I have compiled a list of some awesome Data Scientists on GitHub. In addition, you’ll also find the list of best data science tutorials available on GitHub. Specially for beginners, if don’t know about GitHub, here’s the quick introduction in simple words.</p>

<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
<p>You can best understand GitHub as a social network for coders across the globe. Coders across the world can share their codes and work in collaborative manner using GitHub. GitHub started in 2008 and is a web based platform which provides online project hosting using Git.</p>
<p>Git is a version control system which helps you save various versions of your project in the original form and allows you to retrieve them later without any problem. Git was created by Linus Torvalds (he also created Linux) and has been a boon to programmers across the world. It is a free, open source platform, where programmers from all over the world can save, display their codes. GitHub has not only made procuring codes an easy task, but have also rendered immense support to the programmers, coders worldwide.</p>
<p>To be honest, it is difficult to imagine the programming world without Git today!</p>

<h2>End Notes</h2>
<p>GitHub is not just about coding and sharing codes. Its utility extends to connecting with experts and learn from them. The intent behind writing this article is to give you an overview of GitHub and its uses.</p>
<p>In this article, I have displayed the list of top 30 data scientists to follow on GitHub. I have also list down some of the best tutorials I felt are awesome. I hope these repositories turns out to be useful for you!</p>
<p>If you think, I’ve missed out on any useful tutorial or data scientist, feel free to add them in the comments section below.</p>
