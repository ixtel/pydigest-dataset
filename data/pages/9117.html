<p>A tool to manage conversion of C++ code to Python.</p>








<p>A tool to manage conversion of C++ code to Python.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will find a great algorithm, but find that the only
implementation of that algorithm is written in C or C++. In some cases
it might be possible to wrap that C/C++ code in a Python C module.
However, if a C module is not an option, you need to be able to convert
the C/C++ implemention into a Pure Python implementation.</p>
<p>SeaSnake was written to automate the conversion of <a href="https://webkit.org" rel="nofollow">WebKit</a> sources
into a version that could be used by <a href="http://github.com/pybee/colosseum" rel="nofollow">Colosseum</a>.</p>
<div id="quickstart">
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<p>In your virtualenv, install SeaSnake, and then run it, passing in
the name of a C++ source file (or files, if you want to provide
the header as well as the cpp file):</p>
<pre>$ pip install seasnake
$ seasnake path/to/MyClass.h path/to/MyClass.cpp -o MyClass
</pre>
<p>This will generate a <tt>MyClass</tt> Python module.</p>
