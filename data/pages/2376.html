<p>As a bit of a delayed answer, several of my packages (marrow.script, WebCore, etc.) use annotations where available to declare typecasting (i.e. transforming incoming values from the web, detecting which arguments are boolean switches, etc.) as well as to perform additional markup of arguments.</p>

<p>Marrow Script builds a complete command-line interface to arbitrary functions and classes and allows for defining documentation, casting, and callback-derived default values via annotations, with a decorator to support older runtimes.  All of my libraries that use annotations support the forms:</p>

<pre><code>any_string  # documentation
any_callable  # typecast / callback, not called if defaulting
(any_callable, any_string)  # combination
AnnotationClass()  # package-specific rich annotation object
[AnnotationClass(), AnnotationClass(), â€¦]  # cooperative annotation
</code></pre>

<p>"Bare" support for docstrings or typecasting functions allows for easier mixing with other libraries that are annotation-aware.  (I.e. have a web controller using typecasting that also happens to be exposed as a command-line script.)</p>
