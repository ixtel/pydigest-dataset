              <p>We’re looking for proposals on every aspect of Python: programming
from novice to advanced levels, applications and frameworks, or how you
have been involved in introducing Python into your organization.
EuroPython is a community conference and we are eager to hear about your
experience.</p>

<p>Please also forward this Call for Proposals to anyone that you feel may be interested.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Submissions will be open until Sunday, March 6, 23:59:59 CET.</b></p>

<br/><br/><h2>Presenting at EuroPython</h2>

<p>We will accept a broad range of presentations, from reports on academic and commercial projects to tutorials and case studies. As long as the presentation is interesting and potentially useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the program.</p>

<p>Can you show something new and useful? Can you show the attendees how to: use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an application? If so, please consider submitting a talk.</p>

<p>There are four different kinds of contributions that you can present at EuroPython:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p><strong>Regular Talk</strong> / approx. 150 slots</p>

	<p>These are standard “talks with slides”, allocated in slots of</p>

	<ul><li>30 minutes (ca. 50% of the talk slots)</li>
		<li>45 minutes (ca. 50% of the talk slots)</li>
		<li>60 minutes (only ca. 5 slots)</li>
	</ul><p>depending on your preference and scheduling constraints. A Q&amp;A session is held at the end of the talk and included in the time slot.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Trainings</strong> / 20 slots.</p>

	<p>Deep-dive into a subject with all details. These sessions are 2.5 - 3.5 hours long. The training attendees will be encouraged to bring a laptop. They should be prepared with less slides and more source code. Room capacity for the two trainings rooms is 70 and 180 seats.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Panels</strong>    <i><strong>NEW in 2016</strong></i></p>

	<p>A panel is group of three to six experts plus a moderator discussing a matter in depth, an intensive exchange of (maybe opposite) opinions. A panel may be 60-90 minutes long. We have introduced this interactive format for EuroPython 2016 due to the many requests we have received to make the conference more interactive and have more challenging / mind-bending content in place. If you have any questions or if you want to discuss an idea for a panel upfront, please feel free to <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=mailto%3Aprogram%40europython.eu&amp;t=Mzc3YmFlNzM3NDdkM2IwMTA1N2FjZjU1MDhlOWQxMDIyZWI3N2QxMSxLYUVlS0JsWA%3D%3D" target="_blank">contact the Program WG</a> to discuss.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Interactive</strong>    <em><strong>NEW in 2016</strong></em></p>

	<p>This is a completely open 60-minute format. Feel free to make your suggestions. There are only two rules: it must be interactive, real-time human-to-human-interaction and of course compliant with the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fep2016.europython.eu%2Fen%2Fcoc%2F&amp;t=MjRlNTY0OTBjMzk5YTc0MzI3MzcxOTM3ZTNjMWI0YmZmNzE2MjU2YixLYUVlS0JsWA%3D%3D" target="_blank">EuroPython Code of Conduct</a>. If you want to discuss an idea upfront, please feel free to <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=mailto%3Aprogram%40europython.eu&amp;t=Mzc3YmFlNzM3NDdkM2IwMTA1N2FjZjU1MDhlOWQxMDIyZWI3N2QxMSxLYUVlS0JsWA%3D%3D" target="_blank">contact the Program WG</a> to discuss.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Posters</strong> / approx. 30 slots</p>

	<p>Posters are a graphical way to describe a project or a technology, printed in large formats; posters are exhibited at the conference, can be read at any time by participants, and can be discussed face to face with their authors during the poster session.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Helpdesk </strong>/ 10 slots</p>

	<p>Helpdesks are a great way to share your experience on a technology, by offering to help people answering their questions and solving their practical problems. You can run a helpdesk by yourself or with colleagues and friends. Each helpdesk will be open for 3 hours in total, 1.5 hours in the morning and 1.5 hours in the afternoon. People looking for help will sign up for a 30 minute slot and talk to you. There is no specific preparation needed; you just need to be proficient in the technology you run the helpdesk for.</p>
	</li>
</ul><h2>Tracks</h2>

<p>You may suggest your submission for a track. Tracks are groups of talks, covering the same domain (e.g. Django), all in the same room in a row. You may choose one of these specialized tracks: </p>

<ul><li>Business Track (running a business, being a freelancer)</li>
	<li>Django Track</li>
	<li>Educational Track</li>
	<li>Hardware/IoT Track</li>
	<li>Science Track</li>
	<li>Web Track</li>
</ul><h2>PyData @ EuroPython 2016</h2>

<p>There will be a <img alt="Link" id="plugin_obj_1434" src="/static/cms/images/plugins/link.png" title="Link - PyData conference"/> as satellite event at this year’s conference. Please submit your papers for PyData through the EuroPython form, make sure to select “PyData” as sub community in the form. PyData will take place in at the same time as EuroPython 2016, the exact date will be announced soon.</p>

<h2>Discounts for speakers and trainers</h2>

<p>Since EuroPython is a not-for-profit community conference, it is not possible to pay out rewards for talks or trainings. Speakers of regular talks, panels, posters and interactive will instead have a special 25% discount on the conference ticket. Trainings get a 100% discount to compensate for the longer preparation time. Please note that we can not give discounts for helpdesks.</p>

<h2>Topics and Goals</h2>

</ul><h2>Language for Talks &amp; Trainings</h2>

<p>Talks and training should, in general, be held in English.</p>

<p>However, since EuroPython is hosted in Bilbao and EuroPython has traditionally always been very open to the local Python communities, we are also accepting a number of talks and trainings in Spanish and Basque.</p>

<p>The talk submission form lets you choose the language you want to give the talk in.</p>

<p>If you speak Basque/Spanish and don’t feel comfortable speaking English, please submit the talk title and abstract directly in Spanish/Basque. If you are able to give the talk in multiple languages, please submit one proposals for the talk in each language, with title and description adjusted accordingly. Please note that tags are only available in English.</p>

<h2><br/>
Inappropriate Language and Imagery</h2>

<p>Please consider that EuroPython is a conference with an audience from a broad geographical area which spans countries and regions with vastly different cultures. What might be considered a “funny, inoffensive joke” in a region might be really offensive (if not even unlawful) in another. If you want to add humor, references and images to your talk, avoid any choice that might be offensive to a group which is different from yours, and pay attention to our<a> </a><a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fep2016.europython.eu%2Fen%2Fcoc%2F&amp;t=MjRlNTY0OTBjMzk5YTc0MzI3MzcxOTM3ZTNjMWI0YmZmNzE2MjU2YixLYUVlS0JsWA%3D%3D" target="_blank">EuroPython Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h2>Community Based Talk Voting</h2>

<p>Attendees who have bought a ticket in time for the Talk Voting period gain the right to vote for talks submitted during the Call For Proposals.</p>

<p>The Program WG will also set aside a number of slots which they will then select based on other criteria to e.g. increase diversity or give a chance to less mainstream topics.</p>

<h2>Release agreement for submissions</h2>

<p>All submissions will be made public during the community talk voting, to allow all registrants to discuss the proposals. After finalizing the schedule, talks that are not accepted will be removed from the public website. Accepted submissions will stay online for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>We also ask all speakers/trainers to:</p>

<ul><li>
	<p>accept the video recording of their presentation</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>upload their talk materials to the EuroPython website</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>accept the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fep2016.europython.eu%2Fen%2Fspeaker-release-agreement%2F&amp;t=ZjljOGRmNWViZmEyYjM2MzY4OWEwYjViZjY1MTY0ZTEyMTI1ZDYyOCxLYUVlS0JsWA%3D%3D" target="_blank">EuroPython Speaker Release Agreement</a> which allows the EPS to make the talk recordings and uploaded materials available under a CC BY-NC-SA license</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>To simplify the organization, we ask all speakers and trainers to accept the video recording and publishing of their session. All talks will be recorded. Whether trainings will be recorded as well, is not yet clear.
