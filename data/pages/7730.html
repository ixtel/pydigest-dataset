<h2>Django 1.9 release candidate 1 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on November 16, 2015 </span>

<p>As part of the Django 1.9 release process, today we've released Django 1.9
release candidate 1, a preview/testing package that represents the third stage in the 1.9
release cycle and an opportunity for you to try out the changes coming
in Django 1.9.</p>
<p>Django 1.9 has a myriad of goodies which you can read about in
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.9/">the in-development 1.9 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>This release marks the string freeze and the call for translators <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/localizing/#translations">to submit translations</a>. Provided no major bugs are discovered that can't be solved in the next two weeks, 1.9 final will be issued on or around December 1. Any delays will be communicated on the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/33itn-jSDIQ/discussion">django-developers mailing list thread</a>.</p>
<p>As with all prerelease packages, this is <strong>not</strong> for production use. But
if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and
fix bugs (which should be reported to <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue tracker</a>), you can grab a
copy of the release candidate package from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a> or on PyPI. As  always,
signed MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.9rc1.checksum.txt">checksums</a> of the release are available.</p>
<p>The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
