<h1>Setting up Zoho Apps on your Django website</h1>
<time class="date">01 May 2015</time>


<p>I'm building StreetBarz for 9 months and only now I decided to setup e-mail for business. I tried Google Apps, but the cost of $5/mo per user is not attractive.</p>

<p>While setting up, first I had to verify that I was the owner. I've added that to my urls:</p>

<pre><code>(r'^zohoverify/verifyforzoho.html', lambda x:
HttpResponse('response-from-the-code-generated')),
</code></pre>

<p>In Zoho website you will download a file, so just place the long string inside HttpResponse.</p>

<p>After that, I had to setup my application to send e-mails through Zoho's SMTP Server. Spent some time trying to figure out that Django default's backend doesn't work with SSL. So what you have to do is:</p>

<p>1) Install https://github.com/bancek/django-smtp-ssl</p>

<p>2) Add these lines to your settings:</p>

<pre><code>EMAIL_PORT = 465
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_smtp_ssl.SSLEmailBackend'
EMAIL_USE_SSL = True
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.zoho.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'user@streetbarz.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL should be the same as EMAIL_HOST_USER, if not, Zoho will give you a ConnectionTimeout when trying to send an e-mail.</p>
