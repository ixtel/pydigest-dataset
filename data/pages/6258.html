<h2>About product</h2>
<p>Every product when it becomes big needs to collect statistics and metrics.</p>
<p>Typical uses are services like: </p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics, but it's not quite handy for backend metrics</li>
<li>datadog.com - great service that allows to set custom backend metrics in your app, but it's fully closed and proprietary</li>
<li><a href="http://graphite.readthedocs.org/">graphite</a>- it's open source tool written in python that store time-series data and show graphs based on this, but it's time consuming to setup and maintain it for small team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloudflipper is a tool that takes all advantages of graphite plus it care on all setup and maintenance work. Think of it as cloud monitoring tool.</p>
<p>You can have personal graphite instance to which you can send any kind of statistics using different formats like: collectd, statsd, custom json.</p>

<h3>First stage</h3>
<p>We've started with stripe integration and than converted in full scale development process.
While work we build Django app that handles all the user management and payment stuff. </p>
<h3>Second stage</h3>
<p>Next step was to handle actual statistics and metrics engine. As a core service we have used graphite, which we adjusted to be compatible with django app we wrote so user don't need to authorize on them both. Graphite service is being deployed to Amazon EC2 servers per each user/team that use it. It full automized starting from preparing and EC2 instance for user to creating separate DNS record using AWS Route53. It involved deep knowledge of AWS and system administration skills. To work with AWS from python we've used <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a> library which is great. To cover app with tests we've used <a href="https://github.com/spulec/moto">moto</a> which emulate responses from AWS.
Important part was to make sophisticated backup system, it works on two levels, we periodically store whole system including graphite installation, plus in addition we store most critical parts like database separately. It's also handled using AWS API.</p>

<h3>P.S.</h3>
<p>We've got lots of experience working with Amazon Web Services api and graphite while doing this project. So, if you have project in mind that correlates with those technology and don't clashes with CloudFlipper it would be interesting to work together.</p>
