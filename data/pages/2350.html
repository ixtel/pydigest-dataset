    <p>We are proud to announce the 3.4 release of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tryton.org/">Tryton</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual improvements of existing features for users and
developers, this release has seen a lot of work done on the accounting part.</p>
<p><cite>Of course, migration from previous series is fully supported with the obvious
exception of the ldap_connection module which was removed.</cite></p>
<div class="section" id="major-changes-in-graphical-user-interface">
<h2>Major changes in graphical user interface</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="first">The search of relation record has been re-worked to take advantage of the
auto-completion. The search box of the pop-up window is filled with the text
entered in the widget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The <cite>search</cite>/<cite>open</cite> button of the <cite>Many2One</cite> widget is now inside the entry
box and the <cite>create</cite> button is removed in favor of auto-completion actions or
pop-up button. This change allow to harmonize the size of all widgets inside
a form.</p>
<img alt="many2one button inside" class="img-rounded" src="../images/tryton_many2one_button_inside.png"/>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">A new image widget is available on list/tree view.</p>
<img alt="widget image tree" class="img-rounded" src="../images/tryton_widget_image_tree.png"/>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The client can now perform a pre-validation before executing a button action.
The validation is based on a domain and so the offending fields can be
highlighted and focused instead of having an error message pop-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The selection label are now available in addition of the internal value for
the export data (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a>) functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The export data window is now predefined with the fields of the current view.
This gives a fast way to export what you see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The predefined export can now be replaced directly with a new selection of
fields. This eases the process of creating such predefined exportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">It is now possible to re-order the list of the exported fields using drag and
drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The range operator of the search box is now including on both endpoints. It
appears to be less astonishing behavior for users even if the previous
behavior including-excluding had some practical advantages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">The client loads now plug-ins defined in the user local directory
(<cite>~/.config/tryton/x.y/plugins</cite>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="major-changes-on-the-server-side">
<h2>Major changes on the server side</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A new <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin">Mixin</a> <cite>MatchMixin</cite> is
introduced. It allows to implement a common pattern in Tryton to find records
that match certain values.</li>
<li>Another <cite>UnionMixin</cite> is also introduced. It allows to define a <cite>ModelSQL</cite>
which is the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(SQL)#UNION_operator">UNION</a> of some
<cite>ModelSQL</cite>'s.</li>
<li>Actually, Tryton doesn't update a record defined in a <cite>XML</cite> file if this one
has been modified outside the <cite>XML</cite>. Now, it is possible to find those
records and force the update to get the record synchronised with the <cite>XML</cite>.</li>
<li>A <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/descriptor.html">Python descriptor</a> has
been added to the Selection field. It allows to define an attribute on a
Model which will contains the selection label of the record. It is planned to
update all the reports to use such descriptor instead of hard-coded values.</li>
<li>A new configuration file format is introduced for the server. It is easily
extendable to be used by modules. For example, the <cite>ldap_authentication</cite>
module starts using it in replacement of the removed <cite>ldap_connection</cite>.</li>
<li>It is now possible to give a logging configuration files to setup the server
logging. This file uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.config.html#configuration-file-format">Python logging configuration format</a>.</li>
<li>The context defined on relation fields are now used to instantiate the target.</li>
<li>The SQL clause for a domain on a field can be now customized using a
<cite>domain_&lt;field&gt;</cite> method. This method allows in some cases a more efficient
SQL query. The method is designed to support joins.</li>
<li>The access rights has been reworked to be active only on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a> calls. With this
design, Tryton follows the principle of checking input on the border of the
application. So it is no more required to switch to the root user when
calling methods requiring some specific access rights as far as it is not
from an RPC call.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modules</h2>
