<p>My completely anecdotal view on the state of Python 3 in 2016. Based on my own recent experience, observations, and exchanges with other members of the Python community.</p>

<p>I did my <a href="https://twitter.com/hynek/status/699928792752594944">first tweet storm</a> today and people asked me to write it up properly so here we go.</p>

<h2 id="gloom:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab">Gloom</h2>

<p>Looking at the PyPI download statistics<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:skewed"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:skewed">1</a></sup>, the Python 3 situation seems <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/45sm94/what_are_the_most_recent_python_3_vs_python_2/czzy5wa">gloomy</a>: all Python 3 versions together are about as popular as Python 2.6 that nobody should use anymore.</p>

<p>And if my company is any indication, Python 2 applications are unlikely to be ported to Python 3.  Why should they?  Python 2 is officially supported until 2020.  Who knows whether the app will exist in that form by then.</p>

<p>The number of these applications is <em>huge</em>.  And this number won‚Äôt decline significantly in the foreseeable future.  Nobody wants to touch their working systems<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:easy"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:easy">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="the-very-gradual-improvement:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab">The Very Gradual Improvement</h2>

<p><strong>But</strong>.</p>

<p>The vast majority of important libraries on PyPI are hybrid:  they support both Python 2 and 3.  It‚Äôs very rare that someone releases a Python 2-only library nowadays (I‚Äôm rather seeing occasionally the opposite).</p>

<p><em>New</em> projects and applications <em>are</em> started frequently<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:nail"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:nail">3</a></sup> in Python 3.  For example, <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/14/moving-from-php-to-python-3-with-patreon">Patreon moved from PHP to Python 3</a>.  Why not?  Unless you intend to use <a href="http://pypy.org/py3donate.html">PyPy</a> (and some rare low-level unicode edge cases aside) it‚Äôs objectively the nicer language.  How often are new projects started?  In the days of micro services maybe more often than one‚Äôd think.</p>

<p><strong>Given the state of the libraries, choosing between Python 2 and 3 is a matter of personal preference and company policy rather than technical reasons</strong>.</p>

<p>Especially community members that joined us later and don‚Äôt have such an ingrained antipathy to Python 3 find it natural to use Python 3.  I‚Äôve seen that both in the Twisted and the Pyramid communities.  People have been trying to use Twisted on Python 3 long before it was really fit for it.  Django ‚Äì one of the main entry drugs to Python ‚Äì by itself did a dent in Python 3 usage by using its syntax in their documentation.</p>

<p>Now remember what enormous growth the Python community had in the past months and years.  At some point those people are going to be in charge while the old guard yells at clouds.  This transition has already begun.</p>

<p><code>asyncio</code> is another interesting topic.  I was surprised how alive and well that little corner of the Python community is (albeit in mainly Russian speaking countries üôÇ).  Deservedly so I may add.  So I‚Äôm <em>not</em> surprised that Python 3.4 was the first one with serious adoption.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab">Conclusion</h2>

<p>What does all that mean?</p>

<p>It means we have to write hybrid libraries for PyPI for the foreseeable future<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:py26"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:4b446252e182cd944dcdae12180464ab:py26">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It means that the PyPI download statistics won‚Äôt look much better anytime soon due to sheer numbers of written Python 2-only code and Python 2.7 <em>still growing</em>.</p>

<p>But it also means that Python 3 is growing.  A new generation of Python developers likes it and doesn‚Äôt understand why anyone would want to subclass <code>object</code> in each class.</p>

<p>And finally it means that Python 3 is not the death of Python.  But we‚Äôll have to live with two Pythons for quite a while.  If we manage to not kill each other over it, everyone‚Äôs gonna be fine.</p>

<hr/>

<p>We for one start all our new projects in Python 3.5 nowadays and don‚Äôt want to go back.  So stop arguing about it and just join us.  I think you‚Äôll like it.</p>
