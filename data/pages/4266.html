        <p>If you're testing out a new idea or getting a product going, you have to choose a web stack to build it on.
For Python devs, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> are the two most popular web framework options.
I have experience with both and have chosen one or the other for my myriad of projects and companies.
My current product, <a href="https://wakatime.com/">WakaTime</a> is built with Flask and this choice has helped us achieve our goals of building an API heavy product which enables 27,000+ developers to use and extend.</p>

<p>Having experienced the benefits of choosing the right framework, I created a worksheet to help other devs decide.
You can go through it and get a "result" of the best framework to use.</p>

<p><a href="/django-vs-flask-worksheet" target="_blank">Django vs Flask worksheet</a></p>

<p>Additionally, if you are interested, here are some comparison points for both Django and Flask.</p>

<h3>Differences between Django and Flask</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/django/django">Django</a> is older and larger, but <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask">Flask</a> has a more active community according to GitHub.</p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>

<p>Many companies use Django and Flask because they save time building the product in the beginning and can scale to handle millions of users as their webites grow.</p>



<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Flask serves JSON responses slightly faster than Django.</p>



<p><br/></p>

<p>However, they are both insignificant when compared to frameworks in other languages.
<em>The reason to use Django or Flask is to increase dev performance, build faster, and have a "fast enough" framework.</em></p>



<p><br/></p>

<p>In conclusion, the reason to use Django or Flask is to save dev time and build faster.
You should use your best judgment and <a href="https://wakatime.com/django-vs-flask-worksheet">this worksheet</a> when deciding which framework is best suited for your use case.</p>

<p>I would also be happy to chat and help you decide between Django or Flask.

<p>P.S. Pirates use Flask, the Navy uses Django. <a href="https://wakatime.com/">WakaTime</a> is a pirate ;)</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Emilien Klein found an <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/_compare?project_0=Flask&amp;project_1=Django">interesting open-source comparison</a> of Flask and Django.</p>

<p><em>Update 2:</em> There is a new tool to visually compare open-source projects: <a href="http://codeology.braintreepayments.com/mitsuhiko/flask/">Flask</a> vs <a href="http://codeology.braintreepayments.com/django/django/">Django</a></p>
