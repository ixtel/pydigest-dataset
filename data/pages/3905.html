<p>Wing IDE Pro's debugger makes it easier to work interactively with Python. In
addition to debugging, it is also a great way to navigate and understand
unfamiliar code, and to write new code interactively in the live runtime
state for which it is being designed.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title-2">Debug Probe</h2>
<p>The Debug Probe is an important part of Wing's support for interactive
development.  This is a Python shell that works in the current debug stack
frame when the debug process is paused by a breakpoint or exception.</p>
<img alt="Debug Probe" backrefs="" class="" dupnames="" ids="" names="" src="/images/blog/debug-probe/debug-probe.png"/><p>To use the Debug Probe, set a breakpoint in your code and start debugging
from the toolbar icon <img alt="debug" backrefs="" class="" dupnames="" ids="" names="" src="/images/blog/debugger/debug_continue.png"/> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Debug</span></tt> menu.  When you reach the breakpoint
or any exception, you can start working interactively in the Debug Probe.</p>
<p>The menus at the top of the Debug Probe are used to select the process,
thread, and stack frame you want to work within. Any changes made in the
Debug Probe, or side effects of code that is invoked here, are made within
the selected stack frame.</p>
<p>The Debug Probe provides auto-completion that is integrated with Wing's
Source Assistant, where you can see call signature, documentation,
and other information relevant to the code you are typing.</p>
<img alt="Source Assistant" backrefs="" class="" dupnames="" ids="" names="" src="/images/blog/debug-probe/source-assistant.png"/><p>You can easily jump to point of definition of symbols in the debug probe or
their types by pressing <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">F4</span></tt> or by navigating from the links in the Source
Assistant.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="title-2">Conditional Breakpoints</h2>
<p>Conditional breakpoints are handy for isolating a particular case for which
new code is being written, giving you direct and convenient access to
the actual data being passed to the code that you are working on.  Everything
you write can immediately be tested against the live runtime state.</p>
<img alt="Setting a Conditional Breakpoint" backrefs="" class="" dupnames="" ids="" names="" src="/images/blog/debug-probe/conditional-breakpoint.png"/><p>To set or edit a conditional breakpoint, right click on the left-most margin
in the editor.  Breakpoints can also be ignore-counted or enabled/disabled
from here, and an overview of breakpoints with statistics is available in
the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Breakpoints</span></tt> tool in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Tools</span></tt> menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title-2">Active Ranges</h2>
<p>In some cases it's useful to set a range of code in the editor as active in
the Debug Probe, in order to make it easier to execute while working
on it. This is done with the icons in the upper right corner of the Debug
Probe.</p>
<img alt="Active Range in the Debug Probe" backrefs="" class="" dupnames="" ids="" names="" src="/images/blog/debug-probe/active-range.png"/><p>Once an active range is set, it is highlighted in the editor and can be
sent to the Debug Probe by pressing the icon in the top right of the
Debug Probe or by binding a key to the command
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">debug-probe-evaluate-active-range</span></tt>.</p>

<p>A quick introduction to Wing IDE's features can be found in our
<a class="reference" href="http://localhost/blog/new-screencast">Feature Overview Screencast</a>.</p>
<p>Or just <a class="reference" href="http://wingware.com/downloads">download Wing IDE</a> and
give it a try.  The <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Tutorial</span></tt> in Wing's <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Help</span></tt> menu is a great
way to get started.</p>
