<pre>Hello,

MicroPython is a lean and efficient Python implementation for
microcontrollers, embedded, and mobile systems (which also runs just as
fine on desktops of course).

<a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython">https://github.com/micropython/micropython</a>

Recent 1.5 release is an important milestone for the project, major
changes including:

1. Advanced REPL support with smart auto-indent and auto-completion for
comfortable interactive typing pf Python code, easily switchable to
paste mode to copy pre-made code snippets.

2. Support for client SSL connections.

3. upip, MicroPython builtin package manager, is now fully standalone
thanks to SSL support.

4. There's new, elaborated API to access hardware features ("machine"
module).

5. There're now 2 well-supported microcontroller boards for
MicroPython, and dozen(s) community-supported ones.

6. MicroPython was selected as one of the languages supported for BBC
micro:bit initiative:

7. There's work on native efficient JNI bridge, inspired by Kivy's
PyJNIus module, included into growing Android port.


More detailed changelog for this version is at
<a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.5">https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.5</a>

MicroPython supports growing subset of Python3 standard library
(including simplified asyncio package) - not included by default with
an executable, but easily installable per-module using builtin "upip"
package manager:
