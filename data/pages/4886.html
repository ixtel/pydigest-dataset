    <div><p>Python is not a functional programming language, but it is a multi-paradigm language that makes functional programming easy to perform, and easy to mix with other programming styles. In this paper, David Mertz, a director of Python Software Foundation, examines the functional aspects of the language and points out which options work well and which ones you should generally decline.</p><p>Mertz describes ways to avoid Python’s imperative-style flow control, the nuances of callable functions, how to work lazily with iterators, and the use of higher-order functions. He also lists several third-party Python libraries useful for functional programming.</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul><li>Using encapsulation and other means to describe "what" a data collection consists of, rather than "how" to construct a data collection</li><li>Creating callables with named functions, lambdas, closures, methods of classes, and multiple dispatch</li><li>Using Python’s iterator protocol to accomplish the same effect as a lazy data structure</li><li>Creating higher-order functions that take functions as arguments and/or produce a function as a result</li></ul><p>David Mertz is a director of the Python Software Foundation, and chair of its Trademarks and Outreach &amp; Education Committees. He wrote the columns <i>Charming Python</i> and <i>XML Matters</i> for IBM developerWorks and the Addison-Wesley book <i>Text Processing in Python</i>. David has spoken at multiple OSCON and PyCon events.</p></div>
