<p>Python implementation of Lua-style pattern matching</p>








<p>A Python 3.3+ implementation of the <a href="http://www.lua.org/home.html" rel="nofollow">Lua language’s</a> pattern matching
functions. Lua’s pattern matching is simpler than regular expressions
and lacks several features that regexes have, such as <tt>|</tt> for
alternation, but also contains some features difficult or impossible to
duplicate in most regex flavors, such as the ability to easily match a
balanced pair of parentheses (or any two other characters).</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p><tt>pip install luapatt</tt></p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>For documentation on how pattern matching works, please read the <a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.4.1" rel="nofollow">Lua
reference manual</a>. This library contains the following differences from
stock Lua:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>%c</tt>, <tt>%g</tt>, <tt>%p</tt>, and their negated counterparts are not
available; attempting to use them will raise the built-in
<tt>NotImplementedError</tt>.</li>
<li>Other character classes that rely on the meaning of a character call
Python’s <tt>str.is*</tt> family of methods, and so use the Unicode
definition of that meaning.</li>
<li>String positions are zero-based instead of one-based, reflecting the
fact that Python is generally zero-based (as opposed to Lua, which
has one-based indexes). This affects position captures and the
indexes returned as the first two results from <tt>find()</tt>.</li>
<li>Function return values are combined into a tuple, as is standard with
Python. However, singleton tuples are not returned; the single value
is returned directly instead.</li>
<li><tt>gsub()</tt> does <em>not</em> return the number of substitutions by default,
instead returning only the new string. To get the count, pass the
named argument <tt>count=True</tt> to the call (which will result in a
2-tuple of the new string and the count).</li>
<li>An extra function, <tt>set_escape_char()</tt>, is provided to change the
escape character. It takes one argument: the new escape character,
which must be a <tt>str</tt> object of length 1. The escape character
cannot be set to any of the other special characters. While it is
possible to set it to a letter or number, this is not recommended as
it may interfere with other aspects of pattern matching, and doing so
may be disallowed in the future.<ul>
<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> Because <tt>set_escape_char</tt> modifies global state, it is
<strong>not</strong> thread-safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unlike Lua, which has no notion of a Unicode string and assumes all
characters are one byte in length, this library operates on full
Unicode strings (i.e. <tt>str</tt> objects). If you pass bytes objects to
this library, the behavior is undefined.</li>
</ul>
