<p>Wing IDE Pro's debugger makes is easier to work interactively with Python. In
addition to debugging, it is also a great way to navigate and understand
unfamiliar code, and to write new code interactively in the live runtime
state for which the code is being designed.</p>
<p>A great little feature in Wing's debugger is the ability to move the program
counter back to code you have already executed.  This way, if you debug too far
you can go back without having to restart your debug process.</p>
<p>This is done by right-clicking on the line where you want to move the program
counter and selecting <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Move</span> <span class="pre">Program</span> <span class="pre">Counter</span> <span class="pre">Here</span></tt>:</p>
<img alt="Move Program Counter" backrefs="" class="" dupnames="" ids="" names="" src="/images/blog/move-program-counter/move-counter.png"/><p>That's all there is to it!</p>
<img alt="Move Program Counter Result" backrefs="" class="" dupnames="" ids="" names="" src="/images/blog/move-program-counter/move-result.png"/><p>Note that due to the way Python is implemented, the program counter can only
be moved within the current bottom-most stack frame.</p>
<p>To try this out, <a class="reference" href="/downloads">download Wing now</a>!</p>
