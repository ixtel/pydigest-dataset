PyDev 3.9.1 has just been released.</p>
<p>
There are some noteworthy improvements done:
</p><ul>
<li>Preferences may now be saved and persisted per project or to the user settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For configuring the preferences, the approach is a bit different from most other Eclipse plugin, as it extends the existing preferences pages instead of creating project property pages and allows saving the options to multiple projects or to the user settings from there.

</p>








<ul>
<li>The pytest integration had some critical issues fixed (related to expected failures no longer being reported as failures and conftest loading fixed by automatically running from the proper folder).</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The attach to process is now working in Mac OS.</li>
</ul>
