<p>Simple middleware to restrict access to "private beta" sites</p>








<p>This is a simple Django app with middleware to block access (in a
user-friendly, but not particularly secure way) to early beta or testing sites.</p>
<p>The middleware checks for the presence of a session token. If it matches the
token specified in settings, the request procedes normally; if it doesn’t,
the middleware displays a “please enter the token” form instead.  A single
token is shared for all authorized viewers.</p>
<p>The point is not to provide high security, but to instead prevent casual
visitors and crawlers from poking around a beta or testing site, while at the
same time making it <em>super easy</em> to give access to designers and people of
varying computer literacy.  You just have to tell them:  “Oh, the magic word is
‘fiddlesticks’”, and they can instantly get access without having to do any
sort of registration.  The goal is to be nicer user experience than HTTP basic
auth for this purpose.</p>

<li><p>Add middleware:</p>
<pre>MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES += ("fence.middleware.Fence",)

{# Add a class to &lt;body&gt; which lets us hide footers/headers/etc. #}
{% block body_class %}front-gate{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

    &lt;form method='post' action=''&gt;{% csrf_token %}
        &lt;p&gt;We're still in beta.  What's the magic word?&lt;/p&gt;
        {{ form }}
        &lt;input type='submit' value='Let me in!' /&gt;
