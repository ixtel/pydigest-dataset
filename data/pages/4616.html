                                Did you know that Australia is making text-based computer programming a core requirement for high school students? Grok Learning is building the platform to make teaching it to kids a joy for teachers and students. Our guest, Dr. James Curran is a key player in both of these projects.
</p>
<p>Join Michael in a conversation with Dr. Curran from Sydney University and co-founder of Grok Learning to learn about both of these and more! You'll learn about the different types of online tutorials, or short courses, you can use for learning or teaching including a text-based MUD game!
