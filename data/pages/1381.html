<p>The goal of this project is to be a concise guide for those transitioning from Python to Scala. This is by <em>no means</em> meant to be a complete guide to Scala, but rather some (hopefully) helpful snippets of code to help you translate between the two languages.</p>
<p>This guide loosely follows along with the text of <a href="http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html" target="_blank">Scala for the Impatient</a>, a great introductory book for those learning Scala. You might find it helpful to read it alongside the chapters from this repo.</p>
<p>Note that in general, you should not try to directly translate idioms from one language to another; you don't want to write Scala that looks like Python- you want to write Scala that looks like Scala! You should strive to write idiomatic code whenever possible. A good starting point is Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/" target="_blank">Effective Scala</a></p>
<p>I recommend reading through the guide in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variables and Arithmetic</li>
<li>Conditionals</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Strings</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>Classes</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some Scala topics not discussed above that I think are important to review:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pattern Matching</strong> This is like a switch statement on turbo, and is very powerful and oft used. The <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026914.do" target="_blank">Scala Cookbook</a> has really great practical examples.</li>
<li><strong>Auxiliary Constructors</strong> Classes can have multiple constructors that operate on different argument types/number of args.</li>
<li><strong>Case Classes</strong> as an immutable, record-like data-structure that can be pattern-matched.</li>
<li><strong>Scala Collections</strong> There is a lot of power in all of the methods available to data structures like Vector, Array, List, Sequence, Set, etc. Just take a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Seq" target="_blank">look</a> at all of the available methods.</li>
</ul>
