<p><code>attrgetter</code> is designed to be used in places where a function is required as a replacement for <code>lambda</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code># equivalent
heads = map(attrgetter('head'), objs)
heads = map(lambda o: o.head, objs)
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, the point of <code>attrgetter</code> is to create a side-effect-free function that returns a useful value, and which can be used in expressions that require a function. An <code>attrsetter</code>, on the other hand, would only operate by side effect, and would need to return <code>None</code> by Python convention. Since <code>attrsetter</code> would not be at all useful as argument to <code>map</code> and similar, it is not provided. If you need <code>attrsetter</code>, simply write a normal <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>Also note that both of the above idioms are better expressed with a list comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>heads = [o.head for o in objs]
</code></pre>

<p><code>attrgetter</code> is rarely needed and has lost much of its appeal once it was announced that <code>lambda</code> will not be removed from Python 3 after all.</p>
