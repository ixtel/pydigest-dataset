<p>Redis locking mechanism</p>








<p>redlock-py - Redis distributed locks in Python</p>
<p>This python lib implements the Redis-based distributed lock manager algorithm
[described in this blog post](<a href="http://antirez.com/news/77" rel="nofollow">http://antirez.com/news/77</a>).</p>
<p>To create a lock manager:</p>
<blockquote>
dlm = Redlock([{“host”: “localhost”, “port”: 6379, “db”: 0}, ])</blockquote>
<p>To acquire a lock:</p>
<blockquote>
my_lock = dlm.lock(“my_resource_name”,1000)</blockquote>
<p>Where the resource name is an unique identifier of what you are trying to lock
and 1000 is the number of milliseconds for the validity time.</p>
<p>The returned value is <cite>False</cite> if the lock was not acquired (you may try again),
otherwise an namedtuple representing the lock is returned, having three fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>validity, an integer representing the number of milliseconds the lock will be valid.</li>
<li>resource, the name of the locked resource as specified by the user.</li>
<li>key, a random value which is used to safe reclaim the lock.</li>
</ul>
<p>To release a lock:</p>
<blockquote>
dlm.unlock(my_lock)</blockquote>
<p>It is possible to setup the number of retries (by default 3) and the retry
delay (by default 200 milliseconds) used to acquire the lock.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This code implements an algorithm which is currently a proposal,
it was not formally analyzed. Make sure to understand how it works before using it
in your production environments.</p>
