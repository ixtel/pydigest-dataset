<p>I'm using GoogleAppEngine SDK 1.9.30 on osX10.10.5, with readlineV6.2.4.1 and when I enter pdb.set_trace(), readline doesn't seem to be active.</p>

<p>When I start dev_appserver.py and enter the breakpoint, 
If I attempt to use the up arrow to recall earlier statements displays ^[[A or to correct a mistake on the same line with the back arrow prints ^[[D  </p>

<p>How can I get readline working with pdb in App Engine?</p>

<p>EDIT: 
I believe the SDK has python modules designed to work with App Engine, so you can't just add the path to my local site-packages dir. </p>

<p>I tried adding just the required modules:  </p>

<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/readline.pyc')  
sys.path.append('/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gnureadline.so')  

import readline 
</code></pre>

<p>I still got: 
   ImportError: No module named readline </p>
