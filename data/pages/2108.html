<br/>
<span><a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/oauth-authentication-with-flask" target="_blank">OAuth Authentication with Flask</a></span><br/>
This post gives you an introduction to the OAuth protocol and then shows you a complete Flask application that implements "Sign In with Facebook" and "Sign In with Twitter" functionality. With these two implementations as a guide you should find it easy to add any other OAuth providers you may need.<br/>
<br/>

Although PyPy STM is still a work in progress, in many cases it can already run CPU-bound code faster than regular PyPy, when using multiple cores. Here we will see how to slightly modify Tornado IO loop to use transaction module.<br/>

<span><a href="http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2014/11/18/python-for-data-science/" target="_blank">A modern guide to getting started with Data Science and Python</a></span><br/>
Python has an extremely rich and healthy ecosystem of data science tools. Unfortunately, to outsiders this ecosystem can look like a jungle (cue snake joke). This post provides a step-by-step guide to venturing into this PyData jungle.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://beneathdata.com/how-to/visualizing-my-location-history/" target="_blank">Visualizing My Location History with Python, Shapely, and Basemap</a></span><br/>
This post focuses on how to analyze your location history data and produce some cool maps to visualize how you spend your time.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://tech.marksblogg.com/crushing-caching-cdn-django.html" target="_blank">Crushing, caching and CDN deployment in Django</a></span> <br/>
Caching pages, or even portions of pages is one of the easier ways to speed up a website's performance. Minifying markup can help save space in memory-based data stores. Using a CDN means your users can potentially download the content closer to where they are. This post walks through performing all the above in a Django project.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://caremad.io/2014/11/distributing-a-cffi-project/" target="_blank">Distributing a CFFI Project</a></span><br/>
CFFI is a great tool for calling into C from within Python and while it does have a number of problems when it comes to packaging up software using CFFI none of those issues are deal breakers or which can't be worked around in some fashion. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2255110" target="_blank">Integrating Python and .NET Using IronPython</a></span> <br/>
Jesse Smith shows you how to combine the two languages to serve the same .NET application. You get the best of both worlds: Python and .NET work together to provide reusable code functionality without your having to rewrite the code base for a single environment.<br/>

<span><a href="https://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2014/11/13/stealthy-django-deployments/" target="_blank">Stealthy Django Deployments</a></span><br/>
This post outlines what we're currently doing to quickly deploy new versions of our main Django application in the middle of the day, while most of the company is online and working, without interrupting any user requests or long-running tasks.<br/>

<strong><span><span><span>Books</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1783989483/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1783989483&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=pythonweekly-20&amp;linkId=FZSCNF7AUKTR7W7T" target="_blank">Scikit-Learn Cookbook</a></span><br/>
The book starts by walking through different methods to prepare your data--be it a dataset with missing values or text columns that require the categories to be turned into indicator variables. After the data is ready, you'll learn different techniques aligned with different objectives--be it a dataset with known outcomes such as sales by state, or more complicated problems such as clustering similar customers. Finally, you'll learn how to polish your algorithm to ensure that it's both accurate and resilient to new datasets.<br/>

<strong><span><span><span>Interesting Projects, Tools and Libraries</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/Russell91/runcython" target="_blank">runcython</a></span><br/>
runcython lets you compile and run cython in one line. There's no need to muck around with distutils or intermediate files. Using cython the typical way would require creating 5 distinct files, accum.pyx, accum.c, accum.so, setup.py, and use.py. That's a lot of moving parts to keep track of. runcython keeps things simple so that you can just focus on writing fast code.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/danderu/rapid.py" target="_blank">rapid.py</a></span><br/>
rapid.py is basically a python template designed for creating high-fidelity prototypes fast. The main purpose of rapid.py is to allow people to create prototypes without having to implement unused code in the final version of their product. You can create an API for your mobile app, or a responsive web version of your app or service. Put rapid.py in a production environment and store data with MongoDB for analyze it later.<br/>

Combi is a Pythonic package for combinatorics. It  lets you explore spaces of permutations and combinations as if they were Python sequences, but without generating all the permutations/combinations in advance. It lets you specify a lot of special conditions on these spaces. It also provides a few more classes that might be useful in combinatorics programming.<br/>
