This is the first article in what will become a set of tutorials on how to carry out natural language document classification, for the purposes of sentiment analysis and, ultimately, automated trade filter or signal generation. This particular article will make use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify text documents into mutually exclusive groups.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.defuze.org/archives/315-create-a-docker-container-for-your-cherrypy-application.html" target="_blank">Create a docker container for your CherryPy application</a></span><br/>
This article guides you through the steps to create a base container image that will support creating per-project images that can be run in containers.<br/>

This post explains how to extract text from images like these using the Ocropus OCR library. Plain text has a number of advantages over images of text: you can search it, it can be stored more compactly and it can be reformatted to fit seamlessly into web UIs.<br/>

<span><a href="https://github.com/iminurnamez/pyroller" target="_blank">Py Rollers Casino</a></span><br/>
Py Rollers Casino is a group Pygame project focused on creating a collection of casino mini-games. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/bjarneo/Spotipy" target="_blank">Spotipy</a></span><br/>
Use this cli application as a Spotify remote. Including search and start songs.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/amscanne/huptime" target="_blank">Huptime</a></span><br/>
Huptime is a tool for achieving zero downtime restarts without the need to modify your program in any way. Although many applications support reloading configurations while running, a zero downtime restart allows for upgrading the application code without rejecting any clients.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/secforce/sparta" target="_blank">SPARTA</a></span><br/>
SPARTA is a python GUI application which simplifies network infrastructure penetration testing by aiding the penetration tester in the scanning and enumeration phase. It allows the tester to save time by having point-and-click access to his toolkit and by displaying all tool output in a convenient way. If little time is spent setting up commands and tools, more time can be spent focusing on analysing results. Despite the automation capabilities, the commands and tools used are fully customisable as each tester has his own methods, habits and preferences.<br/>

<strong><span><span><span>Upcoming Events and Webinars</span></span></span></strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3302" target="_blank">Webinar: Testing Client-Side Applications with Django</a></span><br/>
You've built a fantastic REST API and client-side application to consume it. With all your focus on separating the client and server you missed on a critical piece: how do you test it? During the session we'll examine a simple REST API with Django connected to a single page application built with Backbone. We'll look at some of the tools available test the application with both Javascript unittests and integration tests written in Python. We'll also look at how to organize them in a sane way for your project workflow.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3255" target="_blank">Webinar: The Five Kinds of Python Functions</a></span><br/>
In this hands-on webcast led by Steven Lott, author of 'Python for Secret Agents' we'll look at code samples for functions, lambdas, callables, generator functions and functions that wrap object methods, all of which are similar, but have some important differences. Don't miss this informative webcast.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-sf/events/219654226/" target="_blank">How to Build a Python Web Application Using Flask and Neo4j - San Francisco, CA</a></span><br/>
In this session, we'll walk through a sample blogging application that uses py2neo, one of Neo4j's Python drivers, to build social aspects into our application. This will include recommending similar users to the currently-logged-in user, along with displaying similarities between two users when one user visits another user's profile.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/django-nyc/events/219412555/" target="_blank">2014 Django Round Up &amp; 2015 Hot Launch - New York, NY</a></span><br/>
We have something a bit different for our January meeting. For the first half of the meetup we are asking people to give a ten minute presentation of the site or new feature they launched in 2014. And the second half will be for people planning to launch in 2015. We'll get back to you later in the year to find out how its going. Prepare to demo along with a few slides showing your system architecture (hosting service/cloud provider, load balancers, web servers, db, redis, celery, rabbitmq, monitoring, logging, CI, that sort of thing).<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/New-York-City-Storm-User-Group/events/219217628/" target="_blank">Python on Storm: PyData meets Big Data - New York, NY</a></span><br/>
This talk will explore the history of Python and Storm interoperability options, starting with the Nathan Marz's original storm.py implementation, AirSage's Petrel, Parse.ly's streamparse, and recently, Yelp's pyleus. The talk will also explore a real-world use of Storm. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/pythonsd/events/219205663/" target="_blank">San Diego Python Meetup January 2015 - San Diego, CA</a></span><br/>
Travis Swicegood will introduce you to conda, the build tool behind the Anaconda Python distribution. Anaconda gives you all of the scientific Python stack on all three operating systems, but conda is what makes it possible to keep everything up-to-date.  Conda can be used for so much more -- packaging your own code, creating and sharing environments, and more.  Come check out this talk to learn how Conda can help ease your development.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.meetup.com/pythonkc/events/209850082/" target="_blank">PYKC Monthly Meetup January 2015 - Kansas City, MO</a></span><br/>
What the pex? Jon Smajda will discuss pex and why you might want to use it to package your Python programs. Decorating Python: Chip Warden will discuss Python decorators and hopefully demystifying what they are and how they work. This discussion will not focus on creating your own decorators, but resources will be provided on the subject.<br/>
