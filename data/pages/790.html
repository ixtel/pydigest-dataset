<html><body><div><div class="sqs-block-content"><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gtaylor/python-colormath">python-colormath</a> was startedback in 2008, when I was an undergraduate at Clemson University (Go Tigers!).
While there are a good number of people out there making use of the module
effectively, there were a lot of things I wanted to do differently in an
eventual 2.0 release. There were some usability issues that arose from my
being relatively new to Python at the time.</p>
<p>But all has been made well now. I am happy to announce the immediate release of
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colormath/">python-colormath 2.0</a>! A
few hilights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://python-colormath.readthedocs.org/">Better documentation</a></li>
<li>Python 3.3+ support added. Python 2.6 and lower no longer supported.</li>
<li>A complete re-working of <span class="caps">RGB</span> and <span class="caps">RGB</span> conversions. I’m biased, but I think we’ve
now got more correct <span class="caps">RGB</span> handling than the vast majority of color math libraries
out there, regardless of language.</li>
<li>While the color space conversion math remains largely untouched, there is
now a dedicated color_conversions submodule that is devoted to the cause.
I think this is a good clarity/usability win.</li>
<li>Our unit test suite saw a lot of improvement. They are now easier to write,
more complete, and more helpful when failures occur.</li>
<li>Numpy matrix-driven Delta E functions were incorporated for a nice
speed win. In addition to the standard Delta E calls, you can use a vectorized
equivalent that is much faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="http://python-colormath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/release_notes.html#id2">2.0 release notes</a>
for a more detailed look at the differences.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span>: There are backwards incompatible changes in this release.</strong> In order
to set things right, there were quite a few breakages, but I’ve done the best
I can to document these.</p>
