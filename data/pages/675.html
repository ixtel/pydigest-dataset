decorators your Python code can instantly be exposed to Excel as worksheet functions, menu items or macros.</p>
<p>Excel addins written using PyXLL are fast to develop and offer high performance as well as being easier
to maintain and deploy than other methods of developing Excel addins.</p>
<p>PyXLL is used by investment banks, hedge funds and engineering companies all over the world.</p>
<p>All recent versions of Microsoft Excel for Windows are supported, including Excel 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013
(both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Excel 2010 and Excel 2013 are supported).</p>
<p>PyXLL is designed to work with all versions of Python from 2.3 to 3.5. The standard cPython interpreter
is used which means all of your compiled CPython modules will also work, including 3rd party packages such
as numpy or your own modules compiled with Cython, SWIG, boost or the Python C API.</p>
<p>To use PyXLL you must have Python installed, and it must be the version corresponding to the version of PyXLL you
have downloaded. You must also have the standard python modules included in your systemâ€™s PYTHONPATH,
which is usually done for you by the Python installer.</p>
