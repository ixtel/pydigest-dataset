	A user of one of my Django apps, <a href="https://www.glucosetracker.net" target="_blank">GlucoseTracker</a>, suggested 
	<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen" target="_blank">this</a> to me last week and I actually didn't even know this feature existed.  I thought it was a really great idea and it turned out it can be done easily with about 3 lines of additional code:
</p><pre># base.html

&lt;!doctype html&gt; 
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;GlucoseTracker&lt;/title&gt;

      &lt;!-- Enables 'Add to Homescreen' for Android --&gt;
      &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;
      &lt;meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt;
      &lt;link rel="icon" sizes="192x192" href="{% static 'images/icons/icon_blood_red_192x192.png' %}"&gt;

   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre><p>
	Adding those meta tags and the icon link to the <em>head</em> element of your base template will add an icon to the device's homescreen when the 'Add to homescreen' option is selected in the Android Chrome's menu.  Tapping that icon from the homescreen will then open your Django app in full-screen mode.</p><p>Another plus is that icon will be used as the favicon as well if you don't already have an existing favicon.ico (at least for Firefox and Chrome, haven't tested Safari or IE). </p><p>
	Here's what it looks like on my Nexus 5.
</p><h4>Home screen icon</h4><p>

</p><h4>Full-screen mode when opened</h4><p>

</p><p>
	It's a small change that could improve the user experience, so definitely worth doing.
