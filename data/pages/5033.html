<p>PyCon Australia is proud to release our programme for 2015, spread over the weekend of August  1st and 2nd, following our Miniconfs on Friday 31 July.</p><p>
</p><p>
Following our largest ever response to our Call for Proposals, we are able to present two keynotes, forty eight talks and two tutorials. The conference will feature four full tracks of presentations, covering all aspects of the Python ecosystem, presented by experts and core developers of key Python technology. Our presenters cover a broad range of backgrounds, including industry, research, government and academia.
</p>
<p>
We are still finalising our Miniconf timetable, but we expect another thirty talks for Friday. We'd like to highlight the inaugural running of the Education Miniconf whose primary aim is to bring educators and the Python community closer together.</p>
