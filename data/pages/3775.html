<h1 class="title">PyCon Sweden - get your ticket while it's hot!</h1>
<p>This year's PyCon Sweden, held on the 12-13th of May at <a class="reference external" href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/sweden/hilton-stockholm-slussen-STOSLHI/index.html">Hilton Slussen</a> in
Stockholm, looks to be a spectacular follow-up to last years success.</p>
<p>I'm immensely happy that we got two great keynotes - <a class="reference external" href="https://kateheddleston.com/">Kate Heddleston</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://ianozsvald.com/">Ian Ozsvald</a>
are both amazing speakers - and I'm delighted that we got even more proposals
for talks than last year, even though it did increase the amount of work to
select the cream of the crop.</p>
<p>We've started to sign wonderful sponsors such as <a class="reference external" href="https://fyndiq.se/">Fyndiq</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://lincolnloop.com/">Lincoln Loop</a>
with more in the pipe, but there's still room for more Silver and Bronze level
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.pycon.se/sponsorship.html">sponsors</a>!</p>
<p>Of course, a PyCon conference will never be better than it's participants,
and that's why you should <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-sweden-2015-tickets-15917176704">get your ticket</a> now! Last year we were full,
and although we're releasing a few more tickets this year, we also have a
bigger program, better venue, and are sure* to have even better weather!</p>
<p>(*may not be actual fact)</p>
