<p>The problem depends also on Django version. You use Django 1.7.x or older that requires the positional parameter <code>query_string</code> for QueryDict. It is fixed in Django 1.8 where this parameter is optional.</p>

<p>The second problem is that <code>QueryDict</code> creates by default an <em>immutable</em> instance and there is no way how to pass <code>mutable=True</code> through <code>fromkeys</code>. The keys can not be added to immutable and the method fails also in Django 1.8.</p>

<p>It can be fixed this way:</p>

<pre><code>from django.http.request import QueryDict

class MyQueryDict(QueryDict):

    @classmethod
    def fromkeys(cls, seq, value='', encoding=None):
        result = cls('', mutable=True, encoding=encoding)
        for key in seq:
            result.appendlist(key, value)  # or result.update(key, value)
        return result
</code></pre>

<p>It is implemented more complicated in order to reflect repeated keys. The default value is the empty string because it doesn't make sense to convert it to string 'None' like <code>'potato=None&amp;spam=None&amp;spam=None'</code> by <code>urlencode()</code> method. The default result QueryDict should be the same as <code>QueryDict('potato&amp;spam&amp;spam')</code>.</p>

<p>The presented solution is so strange that <code>raise NotImplemented()</code> would be a more straightforward "implementation". (EDIT: I don't expect that anything more is useful enough to be accepted to Django code base) However I must agree with you, it is a bug with mysterious messages. Unimplemented functionalities are usually undocumented if they don't require a warning note because they can be found endless many.</p>

<p>Other solution would be to modify <code>__init__</code> only:</p>

<pre><code>class MyQueryDict(QueryDict):

    def __init__(self, query_string=None, mutable=True, encoding=None):
        super(MyQueryDict, self).__init__(query_string=query_string,
                                          mutable=mutable,
                                          encoding=encoding)
</code></pre>

<p>because immutable QueryDict instances are frequently impractical and even one half of internal use in Django is with mutable QueryDict instances.</p>
