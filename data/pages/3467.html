	<h1 class="entry-title">Python and SunPy workshop</h1>
	February 18, 2015, from <strong>Andrew Leonard</strong> 
	<p>	</p><p>SunPy is a free, open-source software package written in Python which aims to serve as an alternative to IDL’s SolarSoft (see <a href="http://www.sunpy.org">www.sunpy.org</a> for more information). Python is being used more and more often in scientific research and SunPy allows the solar physics community to benefit from Python’s extensive scientific environment and powerful visualisation capabilities.</p>
<p>In order to introduce Python and SunPy to a larger section of the community, we are hosting a workshop which will cover the basics of Python and demonstrate how SunPy can be used for current solar research. Attendees need not have any experience with Python but should be confident programming in another language.</p>
<p><strong>The workshop will be held on the 26th and 27th of March at Sheffield University</strong>. Attendance is free and lunch will be provided on both days. Attendees should bring their own laptops for working though exercises.</p>
<p><strong>To register for the workshop, email Drew Leonard at <a href="mailto:ajl7@aber.ac.uk"><span class="s2">ajl7@aber.ac.uk</span></a></strong></p>
