<h2>Django 1.4.9 and 1.5.5 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>James Bennett</strong> on October 24, 2013 </span>

<p>Tonight we've issued two releases -- Django 1.4.9 and Django 1.5.5 -- which act as minor bugfix packages. Some of the bugs fixed in these releases are security-related, but these are not security releases; primarily, these releases improve our PBKDF2 hasher to better deal with <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/sep/15/security/">the denial-of-service issue disclosed last month</a>, and fix other non-security-related bugs.</p>

<p>Full release notes are available:</p>



<p>The release packages themselves, along with their checksums, can be obtained from <a href="/download/">our downloads page</a>.</p>
