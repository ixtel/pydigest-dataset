<p>Django Eadred gives you some scaffolding for generating sample data
to make it easier for new contributors to get up and running quickly,
bootstrapping required database data, and generating large amounts
of random data for testing graphs and things like that.</p>
<p>The v0.3 release is a small one, but good:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added support for Python 3.3 and later (Thank you Trey Hunner!)</li>
<li>Fixed test infrastructure and added tox support.</li>
<li>Fixed documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no backwards-compatability problems with previous versions.</p>
<p>To update, do:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
pip install -U eadred
</pre>
