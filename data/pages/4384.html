        <h2>We want proposals from...</h2>
<h3>You.</h3>
<p>This is a community conference. You're coming to the event, and that makes you part of the community. If you've done something that you think other people might be interested in, or that you think they should know about, please do consider telling us about it.</p>
<p>We don't just want to hear from the experts or famous names - other perspectives are just as valuable, so don't let the idea that you're not expert or famous enough stop you <em>because it won't stop us from selecting your talk or the audience from enjoying it.</em></p>
<h3>We <em>especially</em> want proposals from...</h3>
<h4>People who reflect the diversity of our community</h4>
<p>Our community is made better by a diverse set of voices, perspectives and opinions. We'd love to have an intersectional and diverse group of speakers. Please submit your proposals today, and ask people you think might not normally submit to, or be represented at, a tech conference. We can't wait to hear from you.</p>
<h4>First-time speakers</h4>
<p>If you haven't spoken at a conference before, this is your invitation to do so. After all, we want to be remembered as the conference where you started your superstar speaking career. You'll find that a Python/Django audience is friendly and receptive, so don't be shy.</p>
<p>First-time speakers and members of under-represented groups will be given priority for <a href="http://2015.djangocon.us/financial_aid/">financial aid</a>. </p>
<h4>Need help?</h4>
<p>If you'd like any help in proposing, preparing or presenting your talk, whoever you are and whatever kind of help you'd find useful: please see our <a href="https://2015.djangocon.us/speaking/mentors/">speaker mentor program</a>.</p>
<h2>PROPOSE A...</h2>
<h3>Tutorial</h3>
<p>Can you lead a tutorial, on a Python or Django topic?</p>
<p>We'll be holding introductory workshops on our opening day, and more advanced sessions alongside the sprints on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to suggest a workshop for the event, using the workshop proposal form. We're open to all kinds of ideas, and especially ones we haven't even thought of.</p>
<p>If you are interested in sample proposals, here are some examples of what has been accepted over the last few years:</p>

<h3>Talk</h3>
<p>Do you have something to share with the rest of the community?</p>
<p>Proposals on any subject are welcomed, at any level of technical expertise.</p>
<p>Tell us about your experiments, discoveries, solutions, achievements and other adventures, using the talk proposal form.</p>
<p>If you are interested in sample proposals, here is an example proposal along with others which have been accepted over the last few years:</p>

<h4>Talk Format</h4>
<p>The preferred length for talks is 20 to 25 minutes or 40 to 45 minute extended slots, but proposals requiring 45 minutes will be reviewed more stringently.</p>
<p>Session lengths include time for audience questions. You should budget at least five minutes for questions; for example, a 25 minute talk will be 20 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of questions. Please note that audience questions are optional and completely up to the speaker's preference.</p>
<h4>Presentation Recording</h4>
<p>Every session at DjangoCon US will have professionally-produced video recordings for release to either Confreaks and/or our YouTube channel.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to have your talk recorded the please note this in your submission. Doing so will not influence the selection process in any way.</p>
<h3>Lightning talks</h3>
<p>We're planning on at least two days of lightning talks. Anything goes but you have to keep your lightning talk under five minutes in length. <a href="http://2015.djangocon.us/lightning_talks/">We will accept upfront applications for the first day of talks and we will have sign-ups at the conference.</a></p>
<h2>HOW TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL</h2>
<p>There's a proposal form for talks and a proposal form for tutorials and demonstrations. Take a look at them - they'll make it clearer how this works.</p>
<p>Don't agonize over your proposal. Just get it in. We'll get back to you if anything's not clear.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to submit more than one proposal either.</p>
<p>The deadline for submissions is the end of <strong>May 15th</strong>. We'll let you know if your talk is accepted by <strong>June 1st</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Our call for proposals closed on May 15th. Thanks to everyone who submitted a proposal.</strong></p>


<h2>HOW WE'LL CHOOSE</h2>
<p>We're going to choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add up to the most enjoyable and interesting program for our attendees.</p>
<p>We won't just be choosing the ones from the most expert speakers, or even the most exciting subjects, because we need to have a good balance as well.</p>
<p>We'll publish the list of selected talks as soon as we can after the deadline.</p>
<h2>Need help?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you're not sure what aspect of your proposed subject will be most appropriate or interesting, or how to word it, or what level to pitch it at. Perhaps you're not sure it’s what we’re looking for.</p>
<p>That's OK. In fact, we have a <a href="https://2015.djangocon.us/speaking/mentors/">speaker mentor program</a> in place to help you.</p>
<p>If there's anything we can do that would make it easier for you to submit a proposal, just get in touch. We want to help.</p>
<h2>FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SPEAKERS</h2>
<p>Grants to assist speakers on low budgets will be awarded by a committee of the Django Software Foundation. A number of free and discounted tickets will also be made available, and allocated by the committee. More information is available on our <a href="http://2015.djangocon.us/financial_aid/">Financial Aid</a> page</p>
<p>The grants committee will be especially interested in receiving applications from people belonging to under-represented demographic groups.</p>
