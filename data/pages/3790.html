          <p>In May 2014, I filed a bug against a github repository named markyjackson/Cisco as a GPL and Copyright violation of my repositories:</p>



<p>To be exact, markyjackson duplicated the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mpenning/ciscoconfparse/commits/af11ed1a9a7fa33ed01839965e0562d8ab6589eb">commit for the comment delimiter feature on 2010-01-18</a>, and claimed himself as the sole author of <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mpenning/ciscoconfparse">ciscoconfparse</a> (see bottom of this github issue for a screenshot).  I am speculating, but perhaps Mr Jackson cherry-picked this commit because it was one where I commited to ciscoconfparse as the "django" username, instead of my username (which shows up as myself in the repo).</p>

<p>markyjackson is also known as Mark Raymond Jackson (<a href="https://twitter.com/mrayjackson5">Twitter: @mrayjackson5</a>):</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/36991/6017065/abdec0d8-ab4f-11e4-9c54-2d57a33a9127.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/36991/6017065/abdec0d8-ab4f-11e4-9c54-2d57a33a9127.png" alt="mrj_twitter"/></a></p>

<p>My bug pointed out that there were obvious problems with Mr Jackson claiming sole authorship of my previous commits; however, I had no problem with him forking my repository as long as he gave me proper credit for the source code.  This bug was never acknowledged by Mark Jackson on github; however, on June 27th, 2014, I received the following anonymous email, stating that this was a "mistake" while trying to contribute to my repository.  The <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/36991/5991791/528544d2-a9cc-11e4-88f9-1c092e8b658c.png">github/markyjackson</a> account was subsequently deleted.</p>

<p>However, Mark Jackson created another identity as <a href="https://github.com/markyjackson5">github/markyjackson5</a> on August 18, 2014; markyjackson5's repositories include the same content as the original "github/markyjackson":</p>

<p><a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/36991/5991887/2ba1de16-a9d1-11e4-9d2b-4eb19f95584b.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/36991/5991887/2ba1de16-a9d1-11e4-9d2b-4eb19f95584b.png" alt="markyjackson5_projects"/></a></p>

<p>To cite a specific example, when markyjackson5 when uploaded <a href="https://github.com/markyjackson5/Cisco/blob/e7476ed7f9b5614a872ed8b55f31479c9b515ee1/cisco_parse_test.py">Cisco/cisco_parse_test.py</a>, he neglected to change his hyperlinks in other parts of that repo, which pointed to the original markyjackson github account.  Search for "markyjackson" in this file: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markyjackson5/Cisco/e7476ed7f9b5614a872ed8b55f31479c9b515ee1/rtrdef-master/README.md">markyjackson5/Cisco/rtrdef-master/README.md</a>.</p>
