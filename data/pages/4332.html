		<p>I have coded in <strong>python2.7</strong> for about 2 years and I had no clue that all of my code was so broken. The reason for this sudden realization is my use of input() in my code. I started using this little evil function when I was lazy and I didn’t want to type int(raw_input(“Some integer: “)). It seemed so innocent, just there to help you with your inputs, everyone told me that, but did we even know – it’s the most unsafe thing we could write in python.<strong> IT EVALUATES WHATEVER WE WRITE AS IF IT WERE PYTHON CODE!</strong> Python oh python, why would you name it input()?<strong> </strong>At the time I started using it, I think a lot of forum websites, while using, didn’t document its implications completely. But most of the links I visited today did warn me about this – <strong>IT EVALUATES TO </strong><strong>CODE FOR GOD’S SAKE!</strong></p>
<p>Here, see this:</p>
<pre>import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

def dont_print_me():
 print "Secrets"

userid = input("Input: ")

print userid</pre>

<p>I can’t blame the function name completely, my lack of knowledge about the function was the major reason. Another lesson to why not to use any function in your code, without going through its documentation.</p>
<p>The code works perfectly fine in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input">Python 3</a>.</p>
