<h1>Automated Tests in Python</h1>

<p class="teaser">Making your tests work harder <em>and</em> smarter.. to
make your life easier.</p>
<p class="originally">Originally published in the <a href="/python-newsletter/">Advanced Python Newsletter</a></p>


<p>Like any good developer, you write tests all the
time. Regardless of whether you practice test-driven development,
write your tests last, or somewhere in between, you are already sold
on the benefits. In modern programming, this is expected in most
engineering teams - a great situation!</p>

<p>What's not universally clear: when most people say "unit tests",
they really mean "automated tests" - and for Python applications,
there are three distinct kinds of automated test you can write. Each
have their own strengths, and are appropriate in different
situations:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Unit tests,</li>
    <li>Integration tests, and</li>
    <li>End-to-end tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's look at what these are.</p>

<h2>Unit Tests</h2>

<p>A <em>unit test</em> covers a specific component in isolation. This
"component" can be a function, a class, or some composition of them
together. As I define it here, a unit test checks for a
<strong>specific response</strong> to a <strong>particular
input</strong>.  For example, suppose you have implemented a callable
named <code>wordcount</code>, which takes a single string argument - a
body of text - and returns a dictionary. The dictionary's keys are
words in the body of text; the values are the number of times that
word appears:
</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><ol><li><p class="line"><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">wordcount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'foo bar foo  '</span><span class="p">)</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'foo'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'bar'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
</p></li></ol></pre></div>



<p>A simple unit test for this might look like:</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><ol><li><p class="line"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">wordcount</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">wordcount</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestUnit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">unittest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TestCase</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_wordcount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertDictEqual</span><span class="p">(</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">            <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'foo'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'bar'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">},</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">            <span class="n">wordcount</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'foo bar foo  '</span><span class="p">))</span>
</p></li></ol></pre></div>



<p>The key idea of a unit test - testing a component <em>in
isolation</em> - extends in some non-obvious ways. Strictly speaking,
an automated test is <strong>not</strong> a unit test if it does any
of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Any operation over the network</li>
    <li>Read from or write to any data store</li>
    <li>Connect with any third-party service or API</li>
    <li>Touch the file system, except perhaps to load some initial test data or a fixture</li>
</ul>

<p>These are more properly thought of as integration tests. In
practice, we've all seen (and written) tests that we call "unit
tests", and which do one or more of the above. More on this later.</p>

<h2>Integration Tests</h2>

<p>An <em>integration test</em> checks how two
different components or subsystems interact with each other. Like a
unit test, it generally checks for a specific response to a particular
input, though what constitutes "input" can be a little more
complicated.
</p>

<p>One category of integration test has to do with how your
application works (or doesn't) with some external resource:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your Python code persists a set of records to a PostgreSQL
    table, in a way that triggers a stored procedure. You want to
    verify the final outcome.</li>
    <li>Your Python code inserts a document into a Mongo
    collection, and you want to verify that it includes all the
    required fields.</li>
    <li>A side effect of your code is that a certain file is uploaded
    to an AWS S3 bucket. You want to verify this file was uploaded,
    and has the right contents.</li>
</ul>

<p>(Another item on this list: writing a test to verify two
microservices work together correctly. This kind of integration test
has some fun surprises, so it has its own section below.)</p>

<p>Unlike a unit test, this all depends on something outside of the
immediate codebase being exercised. Because it tests the actual
integration, such a test will catch bugs that unit tests never
will. The downside is speed (such tests wills obviously run much
slower, generally speaking), but also reliability (if your network
connection hiccups, you can't run that S3 test). There is also the
ops/sysadmin factor; an integration test may not run if the dev
environment isn't set up with a test database, sandboxed AWS
credentials, etc., while unit tests can generally be made to run from
a fresh source control checkout and virtualenv.</p>

<h3>"Internal" integration tests</h3>
<p>Another form of integration test is more internal to your
application - testing how several components or services within the
application integrate. Let's pick a nice boring example: an employee
expense-tracking system. 
Your relevant classes are Employee
and Expense:</p>


<div class="highlight"><pre><ol><li><p class="line"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Expense</span><span class="p">:</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">description</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">description</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">description</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">amount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">amount</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_paid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">False</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Employee</span><span class="p">:</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">employee_id</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">name</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">employee_id</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="c"># Etc.</span>
</p></li></ol></pre></div>



<p>Now say we have some services used in the application - one of
which is an expense tracker service:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><ol><li><p class="line"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">_ExpenseTracker</span><span class="p">:</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="c"># Maps employee IDs to a list of expenses</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_expenses</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">()</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">addExpense</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">employee</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Employee</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expense</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Expense</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="c"># Record an expense for this employee.</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="c"># And other methods...</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="c"># There can be only one.</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="c"># (This is one good way to do singletons in Python, by the way.)</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="n">expensetracker</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">_ExpenseTracker</span><span class="p">()</span>
</p></li></ol></pre></div>



<p>And also a reimbursement service:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><ol><li><p class="line"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">collections</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">defaultdict</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">_Reimburser</span><span class="p">:</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_payout_history</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">defaultdict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">
</p></li><li><p class="line">	<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">reimburseEmployee</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">employee</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Employee</span><span class="p">):</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">	    <span class="c"># Reimburse the employee.</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">	
</p></li><li><p class="line">    <span class="c"># And other methods...</span>
</p></li><li><p class="line">
</p></li><li><p class="line"><span class="n">reimburser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">_Reimburser</span><span class="p">()</span>
</p></li></ol></pre></div>



<p>(I'm eliding some code for space, but this is <a href="https://github.com/migrateup/automated-tests-types/blob/master/expensetracking.py">fully
implemented</a> if you'd like more detail.) Then an integration test
might look like this:</p>

<p>(This is an abridged version of the full test - <a href="https://github.com/migrateup/automated-tests-types/blob/master/test_int_expensetracking.py">use
the source</a>.)</p>

<h2>End-To-End Tests</h2>

<p>An end-to-end test extends further than an integration test, to
validate an entire flow in your application. Imagine you are
implementing a business networking website. A typical flow for a new
user may look like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>User creates and verifies a new account.</li>
    <li>User imports a list of contacts, in the form of email
    addresses.</li>
    <li>Some of these are existing members of the network site (set up
    in the test fixture), and accept the new user into their
    network.</li>
    <li>Some of the contacts are not existing members, triggering some
    kind of invitation flow.</li>
</ul>

<p>An end-to-end test will exercise all these steps in sequence,
making assertions and checks at many intermediate points. The idea is
to exercise a <strong>full application flow of business
value</strong>. It is especially helpful in a continuous deployment
environment, where the engineering team can deploy many times per
day. Excellent automated tests are critical to
ensure code implementing one feature does not break a different
one.</p>

<p>End-to-end tests do not replace manual testing, but they automate
significant parts of it.</p>

<p>Some frameworks provide a kind of testing client or driver you
can use to implement end-to-end tests. Django, for example, provides a
test web-browser client in its django.test.TestCase class. If you are
building on a framework that doesn't provide a suitable test client,
or have implemented your own framework, creating your own is often a
good return on your effort. That test client can then be used as a
foundation for implementing a wide range of end-to-end tests over
time.</p>

<p>End-to-end tests generally do not test the UI. What we are focused
on here are tests for Python code itself. Your application provides
hooks to the UI layer (in the above example, it would be a set of HTTP
endpoints); the end-to-end test exercises those hooks directly, rather
than exercising the UI layer itself. That requires a different sort of
test, covered by tools like Selenium.</p>

<p>Actually, there is one situation where an end-to-end test can easily
test the UI: when you are developing a command-line tool. Then your
test can invoke that tool in a subshell, invoking a full command line,
and measuring the results and output.</p>

<h2>The Distinctions Are Fuzzy</h2>

<p>In practice people have different ideas of where the line between a
unit test and integration test is drawn, and think of what I'm calling
end-to-end tests as just a variant of an integration test. I advise
you to be flexible on this rather than dogmatic with your
coworkers. It's not worth wasting one second arguing over
semantics.</p>

<p>That said, I have broken these down in the way I did because it
tends to be a very useful delineation, <em>especially over the long term</em>
as an application evolves and is developed over time. That last bit is
important, because the early stages of development can mislead you
here. The vocabulary isn't so important, but the ideas are.</p>

<p>Something I have seen a lot is automated tests that are almost unit
tests (as I define them), except they read from and write to a
database like PostgreSQL, MySQL or MongoDB. This doesn't seem like a
big deal at first, during the initial weeks or even months of a new
code base's lifetime. The problem that eventually shows up has to do
with how the different tests give different types of feedback.</p>

<h2>The Real Value of Unit Tests</h2>

<p>If your automated tests are segmented in terms of unit and
integration tests, you probably have a build environment in which they
can independently run. This will be different targets in Make or
Pavement or whatever tool you use (even if there is also a target that
runs all tests). <strong>The point of the restrictions on unit tests
is so they run very fast.</strong> Ideally, all unit tests run in less
than one minute total on your development machine. Even better if it
is under a dozen seconds. This allows you to run them early and often
as you develop, quickly discovering if your changes break some other
part of the system. You can separately run the integration and
end-to-end test suites - which may take several minutes to run, or
longer - with less frequency.</p>

<p>That threshold of one minute is important for you
<em>cognitively</em>. That means it impacts your concentration, your
focus, and your productivity as a developer. When you are holding
thoughts in your mind, waiting 15 seconds is unlikely to cause you to
lose your context; waiting two minutes probably will.
</p>

<p>Database calls are expensive in terms of wall-clock time. In the
early stages of a project, what sometimes happens is that unit tests
are written that trigger database operations. Because the application
is young, the body of tests are small, and the full unit test suite
completes very quickly. As you and your teammates add more code - more
classes, more services, more components - the wall-clock time keeps
creeping upward. Before long, you are waiting too many minutes for the
complete unit test suite to run.</p>

<p>What I just described for database calls all applies to test code
calling out to some external API, or loading a resource over HTTP, and
so on.  If you find yourself in the habit of starting your unit tests runs
just before a coffee or bathroom break, you've lost your agility -
regardless of the cause.</p>

<p>And this is the reason for the strictures on unit tests above. By
following them, even very substantial test suites can run
quickly. Being explicit on the three types of test from the start can
save your project a lot of trouble later. And for an existing code
base (which you are statistically more likely to be working on right
now), you can incrementally improve your test suite over time,
starting with the next test you write.</p>

<h2>Testing Microservices</h2>

<p>If your application is split into microservices, you will need
automated tests that check the coupling between two or more
of them. This is a kind of integration test, and quickly becomes very
important for the reliability of such systems.</p>

<p>Depending on how modular and self-contained your different services
can be - which depends on both the team's style of implementing, as
well as the requirements of the problem domain - this probably won't
scale indefinitely. The graph of different services can become too
tightly and fully connected. You'll know this happens when you are
trying to write a test that checks how services A and B interact, but
to get them to bootstrap, you have to write mocks for services C, D,
E, and maybe F, just so A and B can get to the testable point.</p>

<p>If this happens, you have a couple of options. The first thing I
would look at is whether it's practical to evolve the individual
services to be more self-contained. Having to mock more than one or
two services is a kind of code smell, that warns you the microservices
may be more interleaved than they need to be.</p>

<p>Still, in my experience, sometimes this is unavoidable; some key
services just have to interoperate with many others, and that's
sincerely the best way to implement the system. In that case, you will
need to rely on end-to-end tests more.</p>

<p>In fact, even if you do not have this problem, I strongly recommend
implementing at least one comprehensive end-to-end test for any
microservices-based application, and to create it early on. The subtle
couplings between N different services quickly transcend a level that
can be easily and fully understood by the human mind. An end-to-end
test will always catch bugs that simpler integration tests will not;
this is <em>exponentially</em> true for microservices.
</p>

<h2>Other Dimensions</h2>

<p>This article describes one useful dimension for classifying
automated tests for Python code. There are other classifications as
well, such as functional tests, system tests, user acceptance tests,
white-box and black-box tests, and many more. These are mostly
orthogonal.</p>

<p>There many more potential advanced Python testing topics -
tests for nondeterministic code, testing multithreaded code, test
design patterns, and more. <a href="mailto:aaron@migrateup.com">Ping
