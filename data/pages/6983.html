Often people complain about the lack of developer skills in western countries like the United States and that problem is amplified when you consider typically under represented groups such as women and minorities. This week you'll meet Laura Blankenship who is doing more than her share to widen the appeal of programming in general and Python in particular. <br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://rwet.decontextualize.com/book/textblob/" target="_blank">Natural Language Basics with TextBlob</a></span><br/>
The aim of this post is to introduce a few simple concepts and techniques from NLP--just the stuff that'll help you do creative things quickly, and maybe open the door for you to understand more sophisticated NLP concepts that you might encounter elsewhere. We'll use a Python library called TextBlob to perform simple natural language processing tasks.<br/>

<span><a href="http://pythonpodcast.com/griatch_evennia.html" target="_blank">Podcast.__init__ Episode 24 - Griatch on Evennia</a></span><br/>
Griatch is an incredibly talented digital artist, professional astronomer and the maintainer of the Evennia project for creating MUDs in Python. We got the opportunity to speak with him about what MUDs are, why they're interesting and how Evennia simplifies the process of creating and extending them. If you're interested in building your own virtual worlds, this episode is a great place to start.<br/>

<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0s7qr56xG4" target="_blank">Graph Databases for Python Users</a></span><br/>
In this talk, you'll learn how to use Python to collect data from Twitter's API, Neo4j to easily and reliably store this highly-connected data, and Python again for quick analysis and visualization.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/memory-layout-of-multi-dimensional-arrays/" target="_blank">Memory layout of multi-dimensional arrays</a></span><br/>
When working with multi-dimensional arrays, one important decision programmers have to make fairly early on in the project is what memory layout to use for storing the data, and how to access such data in the most efficient manner. Since computer memory is inherently linear - a one-dimensional structure, mapping multi-dimensional data on it can be done in several ways. In this article I want to examine this topic in detail, talking about the various memory layouts available and their effect on the performance of the code.<br/>

In the world of testing it is important to write tests that are both easy to read and covering a wide range of scenarios. Often one of these will be sacrificed to facilitate the other, such as hard coding your examples so that your test logic remains clear or by creating an overly complicated setup so that multiple scenarios can be explored. Here we discuss two tools that, when combined, will allow you to explore more of the test surface of your web API while still creating clear and maintainable tests.<br/>

Python Machine Learning gives you access to the world of predictive analytics and demonstrates why Python is one of the world's leading data science languages. If you want to ask better questions of data, or need to improve and extend the capabilities of your machine learning systems, this practical data science book is invaluable. Covering a wide range of powerful Python libraries, including scikit-learn, Theano, and Keras, and featuring guidance and tips on everything from sentiment analysis to neural networks, you'll soon be able to answer some of the most important questions facing you and your organization.<br/>
