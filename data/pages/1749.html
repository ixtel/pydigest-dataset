<p class="description">Allen B. Downey's Think Python is a clearly written book, and wastes no space teaching you how to code with Python. What's better, throughout the book you'll find tips on Python best practices. Each chapter has several exercises at the end for you to practice with what you just learned, and the book also has a section dedicated to teaching you how to debug. Differences between Python 2.x and 3.x are pointed out in the footnotes, and if you want to focus on learning Python 3.x, Michael Kart adapted a version in <a href="http://faculty.stedwards.edu/mikek/python/thinkpython.pdf">PDF</a>.</p>

<p class="description">This website has a built-in Python interpreter, which makes it really easy to see how your code will work without any hassle. Each chapter has sample code you can execute to see the results of your code. Every chapter also includes an exercise at the end for you to try things out yourself. Although the interactive tutorial uses Python 2, it specifies the differences between Python 2 and 3 so you'll keep them in mind if you're planning on working with a newer and more current version of Python.</p>

<p class="description">This is the book that inspired a series of learn ___ the hard way, and for good reason, since it is really helpful for beginners. It claims to be hard only because it walks readers through exercises (which the readers follow and learn along the way), but it is actually quite a simple and easy-to-follow book. The book is written for Python 2.7, though it won't be too difficult to adjust from 2.7 to Python 3 if you would like to learn Python 3 instead.</p>
