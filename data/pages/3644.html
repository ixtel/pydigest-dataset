<p>                        A web framework provides a template for streamlining web applications. As there are so many to choose from, deciding where to start can be a confusing. Beginners want to ensure they pick a framework that they can easily learn, and continue to develop with for years to come. Ruby on Rails and Django are two popular frameworks novice web developers often consider to be their first.</p>
<h2><b>Ruby on Rails (RoR)</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-31843 size-full" src="http://cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ruby-logo-secondary-1.jpg" alt="ruby logo "/>Rails was released in 2004 as an open source web framework. As of February, 2015, more than <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/framework/Ruby-on-Rails" target="_blank">75,000 websites are using RoR</a>.  Rails follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Ruby on Rails maps Ruby files to a table in a database, which acts as the model for the application. Rails makes it easy for users to auto-generate model, view, controller, and test routes. This out-of-the-box functionality is a huge contributor to the allure of Rails.</p>
<h2><b>Django</b></h2>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-31840 size-full" src="http://cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/python-logo-secondary.jpg" alt="python logo"/>Django, written in python, was released in 2005 and is also an open source web framework that follows the MVC pattern. However, Django labels the elements of this architecture differently and as stated in their FAQ, “you might say that Django is a ‘MTV’ framework – that is, ‘model’, ‘template’, and ‘view.’” This is because while a model is in place similar to Rails, the Django nomenclature for a view is “template”, while it reserves the term “view” for the actual content presented in the template. Within Django users create small apps to complete custom functions. These apps can be repurposed for use in different projects.</p>
<h2><b>What’s the Difference?</b></h2>
<p>This horse has been beaten all across the Internet. To keep it simple, the main difference is the most obvious. Rails is written in Ruby and Django is written in Python. This key difference really dictates how the frameworks are implemented.</p>
<p>Python is an explicit language. In Django the developer is expected to explicitly define routes, urls, and field values. Django developers are expected to configure the entirety of the web application. In order to do so they need a complete understanding of how everything is connected so that they can properly organize their code. This is where Django documentation comes in. The Django Software Foundation has done a wonderful job spelling out all the nitty gritty for its user base. Unfortunately for some, this means you have to read the manual.</p>
<p>Rails has become a popular framework largely because developers can automate many tasks. The magic of Rails is that it sets up routes for you. Routes are the backbone that strings the MVC together. Rails users do not need to know regular expressions to define routes as they do in Django. A beginner might prefer Rails’ tendency to put convention over configuration. Some users might consider this useful while others might feel left in the dark. Thanks in part to the sheer size of the Rails community just about any question a beginner might have has been answered on one of many forums throughout the web. It is also far easier to find a comprehensive online course on Rails than it is Django.</p>
<h2><b>How to Decide?</b></h2>
<p>If you are wondering which one is best for you, you might find it helpful to first answer this simple question. What are your future plans for learning Django or Rails? Some people are just interested in learning web development, while others might want to further develop their programming capabilities.</p>
<p>Cementing a foundation in either language is easy but the majority of the current Ruby community is built up around Rails. While Ruby is a scripting language that is capable of doing everything from GUI creation to image recognition, most Ruby developers find employment as web developers.</p>
<p>Python, on the other hand, has a community that is expanding the use of the language across many fields. It’s found a strong footing in the realm of data science. This has resulted in more professional applications of the language.</p>
<p>In New York, there are currently four times more <a href="https://archive.today/4w7zT" target="_blank">Rails</a> jobs available than <a href="https://archive.today/1eTg5" target="_blank">Django</a>. However, there are more than twice as many <a href="https://archive.today/APRsi" target="_blank">Python</a> jobs than there are <a href="https://archive.today/sNiq6" target="_blank">Ruby</a>. If you are looking to develop a career solely in Web development than Ruby on Rails might be the best choice. However, if you are looking to build a base in a language that has professional applications across the board than Django and Python might be your best choice.</p>
<h2><b>Back in Parking vs Head First Parking</b></h2>
<p>Learning either framework is a great way to mature your understanding of Web development once you locked down the basics of HTML and CSS. While the end game is the same, getting started is fairly different. If you are a control freak who prefers tinkering under the hood and getting the hard part out of the way first, then Django is a great choice. If you prefer to quickly launch your first Web application, gain some insight into how frameworks are implemented, and worry about the details later,  Rails will get you on that fast track. Let us know which framework you prefer in the comments section below.</p>
