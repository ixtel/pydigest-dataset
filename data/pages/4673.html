<p>We've worked hard to <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.us/blog/2015/05/15/announcing-our-conference-prices/">lower ticket prices</a> this year, and thus have low prices for students and individuals. <a class="reference external" href="https://2015.djangocon.us/financial_aid/">Financial assistance is also available</a> to those with limited budgets.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://djangoconus2015.eventbrite.com">Register for Djangocon 2015 here</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://resweb.passkey.com/go/DJANGO0915">Reserve your hotel accommodation</a> to take advantage of our discounted room rates. This year the daily room rate for single or double occupancy is $139. Please use the reservation code of <strong>DJANGO0915</strong>.</p>
