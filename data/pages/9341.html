                    <p>In the summer of 2010 <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/fwiles">Frank Wiles</a> of <a class="reference external" href="http://revsys.com">Revsys</a> exposed me to what I later called the "<strong>Easy Form Views</strong>" pattern when creating Django form function views. I used this technique in a variety of places, including <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangopackages.com">Django Packages</a> and the documentation for django-uni-form (which is rebooted as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maraujop/django-crispy-forms">django-crispy-forms</a>). At DjangoCon 2011 <a class="reference external" href="http://tothinkornottothink.com/">Miguel Araujo</a> and I opened our <a class="reference external" href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/djangocon-us/shbrd/">Advanced Django Forms Usage</a> talk at DjangoCon 2011 with this technique. It’s a pattern that reduces the complexity of using forms in Django function-based views by flattening the form handling code.</p>

<h2>How the Easy Form Views pattern works</h2>
<p>Normally, function-based views in Django that handle form processing look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_view</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">template_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"my_app/my_form.html"</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">method</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">'POST'</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">form</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyForm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">POST</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">form</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_valid</span><span class="p">():</span>
            <span class="n">do_x</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c"># custom logic here</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">redirect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'home'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">form</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyForm</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">template_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'form'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">form</span><span class="p">})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>In contrast, the Easy Form Views pattern works like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_view</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">template_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"my_app/my_form.html"</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="n">form</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MyForm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">POST</span> <span class="ow">or</span> <span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">form</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_valid</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">do_x</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c"># custom logic here</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">redirect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'home'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">request</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">template_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">'form'</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">form</span><span class="p">})</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The way this works is that the <tt class="docutils literal">django.http.HttpRequest</tt> object has a POST attribute that defaults to an empty dictionary-like object, even if the request’s method is equal to "GET". Since we know that <cite>request.POST</cite> exists in every Django view, and os at least as an empty dictionary-like object, we can skip the <tt class="docutils literal">request.method == 'POST'</tt> by doing a simple boolean check on the <tt class="docutils literal">request.POST</tt> dictionary.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If <tt class="docutils literal">request.POST</tt> dictionary evaluates as <tt class="docutils literal">True</tt>, then instantiate the form bound with <tt class="docutils literal">request.POST</tt>.</li>
<li>If <tt class="docutils literal">the request.POST</tt> dictionary evaluates as <tt class="docutils literal">False</tt>, then instantiate an unbound form.</li>
</ul>
<p>Great! Faster to write and shallower code! What could possibly be wrong with that?</p>

<div class="section" id="the-controversy">
<h2>The Controversy</h2>
<p>Before you jump to convert all your function based forms to this pattern, consider the following argument raised against it by a good friend:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>This one of those things where "empty dictionary and null both evaluate as false" can bite you.</p>
<p>There's a difference between "There is no POST data", and "This wasn't a POST".</p>
<p class="attribution">—by <a class="reference external" href="http://cecinestpasun.com/">Russell Keith-Magee</a> (paraphrased)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem he is talking about is data besides <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">multipart/form-data</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span></tt> would still end up in the <tt class="docutils literal">request.POST</tt> dictionary-like attribute.</p>
<p>Where is the controversy? Well, I didn't write a retraction until now. Arguably I should have done it earlier. However, since I never ran into the edge case, I didn't see the need. Yet when it comes down to it, the "Easy Forms" approach has an implicit assumption about the incoming object, which in Python terms is not a good thing.</p>

<div class="section" id="getting-bit-by-the-easy-form-views-method">
<h2>Getting bit by the Easy Form Views method</h2>
<p>Here's how it happens:</p>
<p><strong>Before Django 1.5</strong> HTTP methods such as DELETE or PUT would see their data placed into Django's <tt class="docutils literal">request.POST</tt> attribute. The form would fail, but it might not be clear to the developer or user why. HTTP GET and POST methods work as expected.</p>
<p><strong>For Django 1.5 (and later)</strong> if a non-POST comes in then the form fails because request.POST is empty. HTTP GET and POST methods also work as expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going forward, I prefer to use Django's class-based views or <a class="reference external" href="http://djangorestframework.com">Django Rest Framework</a> which make the issue of this pattern moot. When I do dip into function-based views handling classic HTML forms, I'm leery of using this pattern anymore. Yes, it is an edge case, but to inaccurately paraphrase Russell, "edge cases are where you get bit".</p>
<p>What I'm not going to do is rush to change existing views on existing projects.  That's because personally I've yet to run into an actual problem with using this pattern. As they say, "<em>If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</em>" While I'm not saying my code isn't broken, I'm also aware that 'fixing' things that aren't reporting errors is a dangerous path to tread.</p>
<p>Also, next time I get called on something by a person I respect, I'll respond more quickly. Nearly two years is too long a wait.</p>
