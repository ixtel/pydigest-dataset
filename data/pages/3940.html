In addition, the Jython installer now will install setuptools and pip by
default (runs jython -m ensurepip) except for standalone jar (doesn't make
sense). One can also deselect this installation in the custom install.

&gt; We have identified the following four bugs that need to be fixed for the
&gt; next release candidate of Jython 2.7.0:
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://bugs.jython.org/issue2297" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.jython.org/issue2297</a> - the installer on Windows currently
&gt; assumes that jython.bat still exists, instead of its replacement, a native
&gt; jython.exe installer. This problem slipped through because we were not
&gt; testing the installer on Windows, assuming it was not platform dependent.
&gt;
&gt; I also plan to make the new Jython launcher script, src/shell/jython.py,
&gt; which is wrapped as jython.exe by PyInstaller, be the default launcher on
&gt; non-Windows platforms if CPython 2.7 is available, since we are going to be
&gt; touching this codepath in the installer to fix this jython.bat vs
&gt; jython.exe issue. Also, since the installer is touched, we should be able
&gt; to add automatic installation of ensurepip.
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://bugs.jython.org/issue2300" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.jython.org/issue2300</a> - the new Jython launcher (jython.py)
&gt; currently swallows arguments. jython.py uses argparse, but the arg parsing
&gt; needs more help because jython.py is then used as the launcher for tools
&gt; like pip, yolk, etc. I have a fix that's almost ready to go.
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://bugs.jython.org/issue2298" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.jython.org/issue2298</a> - setuptools currently doesn't check if
&gt; the underlying platform is Windows, so it uses the wrong approach for
&gt; building executable scripts. This is an easy fix, and we fixed the same
&gt; issue in distlib. We are going to build our own wheel for now that we
&gt; bundle as part of ensurepip, however I've been in contact with Jason
&gt; Coombs, maintainer of setuptools to get this upstreamed once we have
&gt; finalized our fixes. Vinay Sajip, the maintainer of distlib, is also
&gt; working on an upstream fix for the changes we need.
&gt;
&gt; <a href="http://bugs.jython.org/issue2301" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.jython.org/issue2301</a> - ensurepip fails on Japanese locales,
&gt; because of a problem in logging timestamps from the ensurepip module. Such
&gt; timestamps are written like "æ—¥ 3/29 14:55:13 2015". Naturally the last
&gt; thing we want is for logging to cause failures like this! Should be an easy
&gt; fix.
&gt;
&gt; So three fairly small bugs, plus one with straightforward changes to the
&gt; installer. I hope to see a soft availability of the RC2 in the next few
&gt; days.
