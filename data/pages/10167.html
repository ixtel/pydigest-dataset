<p>Automatic extraction of data from clinical trial reports</p><p>








# RobotReviewer</p><p>Automatic extraction of data from clinical trial reports</p><p>A simple webserver written in Python which accepts a clinical trial (in plain text/JSON), and returns risk of bias judgements.</p><p>The current release has a DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/15498/ijmarshall/robotreviewer.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/15498/ijmarshall/robotreviewer)</p><p>## Systematic review author?</p><p>This software is the *web-service* version, meaning it's aimed at people who make systematic review software.</p><p>**For most systematic review authors, if you want to try out RobotReviewer, you'd probably be better using the demo version on our website, available [here](https://robot-reviewer.vortext.systems).** If you like it, you could email the person who maintains your systematic review software a link to this site - they might be interested in adding it.</p><p>(Alternatively, individual authors who are adept at installing unix software from the terminal are free to install this version on their own machines by following the optional 'Web UI' instructions below).</p><p>## Developers of systematic review software?</p><p>You may also use RobotReviewer free of charge, but with the following conditions:</p><p>1. You display the text, 'Risk of Bias automation by RobotReviewer ([how to cite](http://vortext.systems/robotreviewer))' on the same screen or webpage on which the RobotReviewer results (highlighted text or risk of bias judgements) are displayed.</p><p>2. For web-based tools, the text 'how to cite' should link to our website `http://vortext.systems/robotreviewer`</p><p>3. For desktop software, you should usually link to the same website. If this is not possible, you may alternately display the text and example citations from the 'How to cite RobotReviewer' section below.</p><p>## How to cite RobotReviewer</p><p>We offer RobotReviewer free of charge, but we'd be most grateful if you would cite us if you use it. We're academics, and thrive on links and citations!</p><p>Getting RobotReviewer widely used and cited helps us obtain the funding to maintain the project and make RobotReviewer better.</p><p>It also makes your methods transparent to your readers, and not least we'd love to see where RobotReviewer is used! :)</p><p>You can cite RobotReviewer as:</p><p>Marshall IJ, Kuiper J, &amp; Wallace BC.

You can run the server in development mode by passing `DEBUG=true python robot.py` which will attempt live code reload.</p><p>## Running the Web UI</p><p>The optional web interface is provided by [Vortext](http://vortext.systems) [Spá](https://github.com/vortext/spa)</p><p>It can be installed by running the following commands:</p><p>```bash</p><p>git submodule update --init --recursive</p><p>python robot.py</p><p>```</p><p>This retrieves the front-end code, and runs the server.</p><p>## Input/output</p><p>Send some JSON by POST to /annotate such as:</p><p>```json</p><p>{"text": "Put the full text of a clinical trial in here"}</p><p>```</p><p>and it will return something like:</p><p>```json</p><p>{"marginalia": [</p><p>   {"title":"Random sequence generation",</p><p>    "type":"Risk of Bias",</p><p>    "description":"**Overall risk of bias prediction**: low",</p><p>    "annotations":[</p><p>       {"content":"A central pharmacy randomly assigned study medication in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization sequence with variable-sized blocks ranging from 2 to 8 stratified by study site.",</p><p>        "uuid":"6e97f8d0-2970-11e5-b5fe-0242ac110006"</p><p>       }, ...</p><p>```</p><p>## Running as a Python module</p><p>We will add full python module functionality to a future relase. However, the current code can easily be called directly from existing python code as follows:</p><p>```python</p><p>import biasrobot # from the robotreviewer root directory</p><p>bot = biasrobot.BiasRobot()</p><p>text = "Put the full text of a clinical trial in here..."</p><p>annotations = bot.annotate(text)</p><p>```</p><p>Where the BiasRobot.annotate() method returns a "marginalia" dict of the same structure as the JSON example above.</p><p>## Help</p><p>Feel free to contact us on [mail@ijmarshall.com](mailto:mail@ijmarshall.com) with any questions.</p><p>## More help!</p><p>Our tech consultancy [Vortext](http://vortext.systems/) can help get RobotReviewer running on your server for you, or can provide fully-managed RobotReviewer cloud instances; [contact us](http://vortext.systems/hire-us/) for details.</p><p>## References</p><p>1.
