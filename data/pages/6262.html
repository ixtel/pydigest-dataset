				<p>I have to confess to being a relative newcomer to the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> language. I have been programming mainly in C/C++ for around ten years now. I had briefly taken a look at Python a few years ago but after making it through the tutorials I just couldn’t really find a use for it. That changed about a year ago when I started using Python at work to interface with serial devices. Since then Python has been my go to language for pretty much anything I could get away with. As an embedded programmer I still write most of my code in C++, but I do use Python frequently, much to my enjoyment. </p>

<p>Python, as amazing as it is, has given me its share of challenges. In today’s fast paced world other languages are beginning to increasingly outclass Python, and I’m afraid we are going to see the number of Python developers shrink. Because I’m sure that if you are anything like me, you would do anything to avoid writing Javascript, lets take a look at the issues I have encountered.</p>

<h2 id="pythononwindowscanbeahassle">Python on Windows can be a hassle  </h2>

<p>My first complaint starts out a bit platform specific but I have struggled with it for some time. I spend most of my time in Windows because of the tools I use for work. Getting Python packages that have any C code in them to compile and run on Windows is a seemingly impossible task. I have tried a couple of times with no real success. Luckily I have found a <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">website</a>  that offers precompiled binaries for most packages that I use. I think that ultimately Python on Windows needs to partner with <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> and include their compiler in the Python installation. It would certainly reduce the hoops of getting the correct Visual Studio version and make compiling packages a breeze.</p>

<h2 id="python2vspython3whydividethecommunity">Python 2 vs Python 3, why divide the community?  </h2>

<p>One area that Python struggles, compared to other languages, is the divide between Python 2 and Python 3. <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/versions/">Python 3</a> has been out since the end of 2008 and the Python community still has not completely embraced it. I still run into projects with new releases that are requiring Python 2.7 with no Python 3 version even planned. I understand that porting everything to Python may take a significant amount of time but developing against Python 2 seems like getting stuck in time; the rest of the world keeps moving on, adding new features and improvements and Python stays the same forever. Its a scary place for me to be stuck like that. I think that more Python developers should take a stand and drop support for Python 2 until we get enough momentum to push everyone forward.</p>

<h2 id="letmeuseallofmyprocessorscores">Let me use all of my processors cores!  </h2>

<p>One of the features I miss the most from most other languages is true multithreading. I tend to use threads heavily in most programs, even in embedded code. With today’s processors scaling out in cores instead of clock speed it makes even more sense to make effective use of threads to parallelize the work. Languages without true multithreading will only continue to get slower as the number of cores rise. I do understand that true multithreading is a very difficult problem to solve, but I believe it is a problem that many people have faced and solved before. Some implementations of Python seem to have even solved the issue and allow true multi threading. It feels like an arbitrary limitation that has very strong negative effects on the usability of the language for anything that needs real processing power. Hopefully we can get real multithreading in the official Python implementation before it loses out to other languages.</p>

<h2 id="pythonisstartingtofeelslow">Python is starting to feel slow  </h2>

<p>The other big area that I feel Python is falling behind is speed in general. With all of the amazing work going into the execution speed of Javascript it is now almost as fast as natively compiled code, and possibly even faster, depending on the implementation. Python, at least the official implementation, is quite slow in comparison and understandably so; Javascript at this point is a fully JIT compiled language and Python remains an interpreted language. There are quite a few Python implementations that offer up great speed improvements but they all come with their own limitations and are not as ubiquitous as the official Python implementation. I would like to see something like <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> become the official Python release and be a direct replacement. Making Python faster eliminates many of the advantages of other languages.</p>

<h2 id="pypihttpspypipythonorgpypiisbecomingagraveyardofunmaintainedoutdatedpackages"><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a> is becoming a graveyard of unmaintained, outdated packages</h2>

<p>While Python does not have as nice of a package manager as other languages (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> I’m looking at you) it generally works well and makes it quick and easy to run my code on any computer. My problem with PyPi is that it feels like a graveyard. Finding a package that does some specific thing is usually a battle of finding the right search terms and then going through the massive list of packages returned to find the one that is still maintained. I propose that PyPi start purging old unmaintained packages. They could even move the old packages to an archive so that they don’t completely disappear, but it would help to reduce the clutter on the main PyPi website.</p>

<h2 id="letsmakepythonbettertogether">Lets make Python better together  </h2>

<p>This post may seem overly critical of Python, and it is. But the only reason I am so critical is because of how much I enjoy Python and therefore want to see it succeed as a language. Python is a truly great language and a joy to work in. </p>

<p>I don’t think I have found a more productive language yet; with most languages I feel I spend more time fighting the language than I do actually expressing my ideas. (For example, consider trying to build a generic callback system using member functions in C++ without using virtual inheritance). Python needs a few changes to file off the rough edges to make it a true competitor for the future to come. </p>

<p>See you next time, happy coding.</p>
