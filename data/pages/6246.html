<a href="http://pydev.org/">PyDev</a><p> 4.3.0 is out now ;)
</p><p>
The main focus on this release was on ironing out the new search dialog (which makes searching even huge codebases almost instant).
</p><p>
Also, there was a high-priority fix which made the Python 3.x parser accept </p><b>async</b><p> and </p><b>await</b><p> as regular names and not only keywords.

</p><a href="http://liclipse.com/">LiClipse</a><p> 4.3.0, which had several enhancements in its parsing structure to make the editor even faster was also released to include the new PyDev version.
</p><p>
And as always, thank you very much to the </p><a href="https://sw-brainwy.rhcloud.com/supporters/PyDev/">PyDev supporters</a><p> which help on keeping the PyDev development going strong.
