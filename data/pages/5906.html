<p>ignore failures from flaky tests (pytest plugin)</p>
<p>A “flaky” test is a test that usually pass but sometimes it fails.
You should always avoid flaky tests but not always possible.</p>
<p>This plugin can be used to optionally ignore failures from flaky tests.</p>
<p>First “mark” your tests with the <cite>flaky</cite> marker:</p>
<pre>import random
import pytest

@pytest.mark.flaky
def test_mf():
    assert 0 == random.randint(0, 1)
</pre>
<p>By default this mark is just ignored, unless the plugin is activated from the
command line (or <cite>py.test</cite> config file):</p>
<pre>py.test --ignore-flaky
</pre>
<p>If a flaky test pass it will be reported normally as test succeed.
If the test fails, instead of being reported as failure it will be reported as
a <cite>xfail</cite>.</p>
