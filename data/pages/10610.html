    Proposals are now being accepted for PyData London 2016. <br/>
<br/>

The event brings together analysts, scientists, developers, engineers, architects and others from the data science community to discuss new techniques and tools for management, analytics and visualization of data. PyData welcomes presentations focusing on Python as well as other languages used in data science (e.g. R, Julia). Presentation content can be at a novice, intermediate or advanced level. Talks will run 30-40 min and hands-on tutorials will run 90-120 min.
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, PyData presentations are intended to share knowledge and experience. We welcome talks letting attendees know how how you are using tools in your work, but discourage any proposals with the aim of selling a product.</p>
