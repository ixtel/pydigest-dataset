<p>Currently, I think the <code>django.contrib.postgres.fields.ArrayField</code> is in active development. The <code>django.contrib</code> package is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mjtamlyn/improved-postgresql-support-in-django" rel="nofollow">new to django 1.8</a> (which is still in beta) so I think this functionality is too early to count on.</p>

<p>The text field you are seeing is meant to be a delimited string which is saved in the array. It kinda makes sense with an array of <code>FileFields</code> because the <code>FileField</code> saves a URL string and not a blob of the file (as far as I can tell).</p>

<p>A <code>\d table</code> gives the table information on that column as follows:</p>

<pre><code>arrayexample=# \d example_post
Column      | Type                     | Modifiers
--------------------------------------------------
attachments | character varying(100)[] |
</code></pre>

<p>Currently the field you are seeing in admin is created from <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/fa9cb5dcdc816fe0e606b8f1020d53526e08b0d4/django/contrib/postgres/forms/array.py#L13" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Notice it inherits from <code>forms.CharField</code> while a <code>FileField</code> uses <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/fa9cb5dcdc816fe0e606b8f1020d53526e08b0d4/django/contrib/admin/widgets.py#L112" rel="nofollow">forms.ClearableFileInput</a>.</p>

<p>I don't think the functionality you are looking for currently exists in Django but I think it is feasible to build it. Personally, I would approach building it by subclassing the existing <code>ArrayField</code> and overriding the <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/fa9cb5dcdc816fe0e606b8f1020d53526e08b0d4/django/contrib/postgres/fields/array.py#L154" rel="nofollow">formfield</a> to use my custom <code>form_class</code> to better handle an <code>Array</code> of <code>FileField</code>s.</p>

<p>I hope this helps, I also don't see any open pull requests for this feature.</p>
