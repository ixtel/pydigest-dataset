<html><body><div><p>Convenience function for 1-step compression of svg files.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>filename</em> (str) - Path to svg file to compress, e.g. ‘test_vector.svg’</p>
<p><em>compression_type</em> (str) - how to carry out the compression. Options are ‘delete’ (remove polygons by size), ‘simplify’ (simplify polygons), and ‘merge’ (merge neighboring or overlapping polygons).</p>
<p><em>curve_fidelity</em> (int) - All polygons affected by compression (e.g. those that are simplified) need to first be linearized so as to convert smooth curves into a set of discrete coordinates. curve_fidelity sets the number of coordinates to use to interpolate a curve. The larger the number, the more computation the code will need to perform. Optional, defaults to 10.</p>
<p><em>outputfile</em> (str) - Path to output svg. Optional, defaults to ‘originalname_compressed.svg’</p>
<p><em>pre_select</em> (bool) - If True, will perform the compression only on a subset of the polygons in the svg that are below a certain size threshold. Optional, defaults to False.</p>
<p><em>selection_tuple</em> (tuple) - If pre_select == True, the selection tuple (‘criteria’, threshold) determines the criteria for selection (‘bboxarea’ for the area of the bounding box of a polygon, or ‘circumference’ for its circumference) and the threshold size (e.g. 100). Optional, defaults to (”, ”)</p>
<p><em>optimize</em> (bool) - If True, use package Scour to optimize compressed svg (e.g. remove redundant nodes, delete id attributes)</p>
<p><em>kwargs</em> - Depending on the compression type and the pre-selection criteria, additional key word arguments may be required. See compress_by_merging, compress_by_deletion, and compress_by_simplification in class Compress for the valid keyword arguments when compression_type = ‘merge’, ‘delete’, and ‘simplify’ respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compressed svg in the directory given by outputfile or in the code directory with the name  ‘originalname_compressed.svg’.</p>
<p>If optimized == True, an optimized svg in the directory ‘outputfilename_opt.svg’</p>
<p>A report string outputted to the console will also state some general indicators about the success of the compression, the path of the outputted svg, and the initial and compressed file sizes.</p>
