                    <p>Here I was thinking that this year's PyCon wasn't going to be so busy because I didn't submit a talk or tutorial. Ha! What the heck was I thinking?</p>
<p>Here's what I've already got in the works.</p>
<div class="section" id="wednesday-march-7th">
<h2>Wednesday, March 7th</h2>
<p>Me and Audrey are driving up from Los Angeles. I've wanted to do this drive for a while, so this is very exciting. We'll arrive in the evening and hopefully tag up with friends old and new.</p>

<h2>Thursday, March 8th</h2>
<p>I'm moderating the Code Reuse panel of the Python Web Summit. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=1c9a94&amp;t=1c9a94.43">Have you submitted a question yet</a>?</p>
<p>In the evening we'll be helping assemble bags for the conference. That's always a blast.</p>

<h2>Friday, March 9th</h2>
<p>PyCon really begins! I'll be at the keynotes, and then the talks begin. These are some of the talks I'm really leaning towards watching:</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that all the talks look awesome. Missing some of these talks is going to hurt.</p>
<p>In the evening we're going to the New Relic/Loggly/Skull Candy party and hang out at the (in)famous TIP BOF.</p>

<div class="section" id="saturday-march-10th">
<h2>Saturday, March 10th</h2>
<p>I'll be at the <a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com">Consumer Notebook</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html">Startup Row</a> booth all day! Come and hang out with us and all the other bright, new companies.</p>
<p>In the evening I'm hosting the <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/">PyCon Capoeira Open Space</a>. We've got a seriously large room assigned for the event, and over twenty five people currently signed up to participate (<a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira">there's still room for signups</a>). Even if you don't want to play a musical instrument or learn/play at Capoeira, come anyway to watch. Some of the players there have some seriously amazing skills - I can assure you've seen them in the movies.</p>

<div class="section" id="sunday-march-11th">
<h2>Sunday, March 11th</h2>
<p>More talks!</p>

<h2>Monday March 12 - Thursday, March 15</h2>
<p>Sprints! Nothing set in stone yet, but some ideas I've had include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Launch python.opencomparison.org for all of Python.</li>
<li>OpenComparison integration of PyPI OpenID, SourceForge OAUTH, and BitBucket OAUTH.</li>
<li>Improved OpenComparison integration of the Launchpad API.</li>
<li>Implement Gitorious API for OpenComparison.</li>
<li>Implement Text Based search for OpenComparison.</li>
<li>Hack on Mongo related technologies such as django-mongonaut and some other planned projects.</li>
</ul>
