<span><a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/37/python-cybersecurity-and-penetration-testing" target="_blank">Episode #37: Python Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing</a></span><br/>
How secure is your application? Do you know the main vulnerabilities that most apps suffer from? How would you even start answer these questions? On this episode of Talk Python To Me, Justin Seitz is here to tell us all about it. <br/>
<br/>

This post shows you how to use the Local Binary Patterns image descriptor (along with a bit of machine learning) to automatically classify and identify textures and patterns in images (such as the texture/pattern of wrapping paper, cake icing, or candles, for instance).<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://pbpython.com/advanced-excel-workbooks.html" target="_blank">Creating Advanced Excel Workbooks with Python</a></span><br/>
No matter how strong the python tools are, there are times when you need to rely on more advanced Excel features to communicate your message or further analyze the data. This article will walk through some additional improvements you can make to your Excel-based output by: Adding Excel tables with XlsxWriter, Inserting custom VBA into your Excel file and Using COM for merging multiple Excel worksheets.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.devdungeon.com/content/gui-programming-python" target="_blank">GUI Programming with Python</a></span><br/>
This is aimed at developers who are already familiar with Python but not familiar with GUI programming. I have two goals here. One is to provide examples and demonstrate that GUI programming is not as painful as most developers would expect. The other is to provide a high level view of the widgets that are available for you to use.<br/>

<span><a href="http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/12/09/intro-to-chainer/" target="_blank">Introduction to Chainer: Neural Networks in Python</a></span><br/>
In this post we'll go through the process of training your first neural network in Python using an exceptionally readable framework called Chainer. We'll start by making one of the simplest neural networks possible, a linear regression. Then we'll move into more complex territory by training a model to classify the MNIST hand written digits dataset (a standard benchmark for deep learning models).<br/>

<span><a href="http://pythonpodcast.com/stuart-mumford-sunpy.html" target="_blank">Podcast.__init__ Episode 34 - Stuart Mumford on SunPy</a></span><br/>
What is Solar Physics? How does it differ from AstroPhysics? What does this all have to do with Python? In this episode we answer all of those questions when we interview Stuart Mumford about his work on SunPy. So put on your sunglasses and learn about how to use Python to decipher the secrets of our closest star.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://koaning.io/monopoly-simulations.html" target="_blank">Monopoly Simulations</a></span><br/>
In this post we'll have a go at some simulations of monopoly. We will find out that the 'going to jail' mechanic of the game causes some drastic inbalances which you may want to be mindful of. If you want to win at monopoly, you'll want to be as close to jail as you can be.<br/>

<span><a href="http://tommikaikkonen.github.io/timezones/" target="_blank">Time Zones in Pytz &amp; Django</a></span><br/>
Time zones, those stupid things getting in the way of shipping software! If you read the Django documentation on time zones and still feel lost, this article is for you. I'll assume you are familiar with the datetime library and know the difference between naïve and aware datetimes. I'll also assume you know some Django.<br/>

You will begin with some basic command tutorials to set up storm and learn about its configurations in detail. You will then go through the requirement scenarios to create a Storm cluster. Next, you'll be provided with an overview of Petrel, followed by an example of Twitter topology and persistence using Redis and MongoDB. Finally, you will build a production-quality Storm topology using development best practices.<br/>
