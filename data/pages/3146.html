        <h1>Charter</h1>
<p>The Mobile-SIG exists to improve the usability of Python on mobile devices, as mobile platforms have their own unique requirements and constraints.</p>
<p>There are two goals:
<em> To collaborate on porting CPython to mobile platforms and ensure that other Python implementations (i.e. Jython, IronPython) present much the same environment as CPython when running on mobile devices.
</em> To collaborate on the design of modules for mobile-centric features such as cameras, GPS, accelerometers, and other sensors to ensure cross-platform and cross-implementation compatibility.</p>
<p>The intent is to work on mobile-centric features in this group before proposal to python-dev, similar to how the distutils-sig operates.</p>
<p>Questions of how to use Python on mobile platforms currently are considered off-topic as there are many other existing places for those questions.</p>
