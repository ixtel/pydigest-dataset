<p>Python 3.5 has now entered "feature freeze".  By default new features may no longer be added to Python 3.5.  (However, there are a handful of features that weren't quite ready for Python 3.5.0 beta 1; these were granted exceptions to the freeze, and are scheduled to be added before beta 2.)</p>

<h1>Notes on this release</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The binaries for AMD64 will also work on processors that implement the Intel 64 architecture.  (Also known as the "x64" architecture, and formerly known as both "EM64T" and "x86-64".)  They will not work on Intel Itanium Processors (formerly "IA-64").</li>
<li>Windows users: If installing Python 3.5.0b1 as a non-privileged user, you may need to escalate to administrator privileges to install an update to your C runtime libraries.</li>
<li>Windows users: There are now "web-based" installers for Windows platforms; the installer does not contain Python, but instead downloads just the needed software at installation time.</li>
<li>Windows users: The Windows binaries were built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, which is not yet officially released. (It's currently offered in "Preview" mode, which is akin to a "beta".)  It is our intention to ship Python 3.5 using VS2015, although right now VS2015's final release date is unclear.</li>
<li>OS X users: The OS X installers are now distributed as signed installer package files compatible with the OS X Gatekeeper security feature.</li>
<li>OS X users: There is <a class="reference external" href="/download/mac/tcltk">important information about IDLE, Tkinter, and Tcl/Tk on Mac OS X here</a>.</li>
