I will first give a general overview of the kind of Python packages used in the field and then go in to some specific examples of application that I am involved with. These include mapping the dark matter in the Universe and flying drones to calibrate radio telescopes."<br/><br/>Talk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 5th, 2016.<br/><br/>Licensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.</p></div>  </div></body></html>
