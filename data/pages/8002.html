<p>I have an issue where we have setup a NTLM proxy on the corporate level, but we have some code that we do not own that does not support NTLM proxies.  Is there a way to create a proxy to automatically pass the NTLM information needed using Python?</p>

<p>I would prefer to be able to just stand up the proxy as needed when the script is run at given times.</p>

<p>Is this possible to do?  Can anyone provide a sample on how to do this?
Samples can be given in Python 3.4 or 2.7.  </p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
