<h2>Crowdfunding Multiple Template Engines for Django</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on October 2, 2014 </span>

<p>Loose coupling is one of Django's key design principles. Services such as querying a database, accessing a cache or sending email are provided by pluggable backends. However, Django doesn't provide an API for pluggable template engines. While some third-party adapters exist, there's no standard way to use third-party template engines such as <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>.</p>
<p>Django core team member <a class="reference external" href="https://myks.org/">Aymeric Augustin</a> would like fix this situation by providing first-class support for third-party template engines and native Jinja2 integration.</p>
<p>However, to do this he needs the community's help. Major refactoring efforts with strong backwards-compatibility requirements take time, and that time can be hard to find in a busy schedule. To help fund development, Aymeric has <a class="reference external" href="http://igg.me/at/mtefd">launched a project on Indiegogo</a>.</p>
<p>You can find more details about Aymeric's plans on the project page.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com/foundation">Django Software Foundation</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/internals/committers/">Django Core team</a> have both endorsed this effort. We hope that you will join us in supporting Aymeric's Indiegogo project.</p>
