<p>I have a Django website running Django 1.8 with Python 3.4 and hosted on AWS via ElasticBeanstalk.</p>

<p>Recently, I've been having some issues with the Django admin area and 504 errors. The problem is very difficult to reproduce, it seems to happen randomly.</p>

<p>When I save an instance of a model, sometimes the website hangs and returns a 504 error (and doesn't save). Afterwhich elasticbeanstalk restarts the server and everything works fine again.</p>

<p>In my logs I get the following errors.</p>

<pre><code>End of script output before headers: wsgi.py

extern "Python": function Cryptography_rand_bytes() called, but @ffi.def_extern() was not called in the current subinterpreter.  Returning 0.
</code></pre>

<p>These two errors are repeated multiple times. Can anyone help me figure out how I can debug this?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
