<p>With regard to <code>try_url</code>, I culled this function from a previous scraper I made, as I wanted to test that a URL was valid when I was downloading images and going to the next. With this scraper, given what it does, I guess is it safe to just assume all addresses I get are valid? I was concerned in the off-chance that a listing expires between getting the main URL for the feed and pulling the individual listing URLs, but I know the chance of that happening is pretty slim. </p>

<p>Would it be better to do a try/except and just throw an exception if the data is not as expected?</p>
