                                Have you heard about the works on my machine certification program? It's a really awesome certification for developers. It was created by Joseph Cooney and enhanced by Jeff Atwood (of stackoverflow fame). Here's how it works: </p><more/>

<p>1. Compile your application code. Getting the latest version of any recent code changes from other developers is purely optional and not a requirement for certification.
</p><p>2. Launch the application or website that has just been compiled.
</p><p>3. Cause one code path in the code you're checking in to be executed. The preferred way to do this is with ad-hoc manual testing of the simplest possible case for the feature in question. Omit this step if the code change was less than five lines, or if, in the developer's professional opinion, the code change could not possibly result in an error.
</p><p>4. Check the code changes into your version control system.

</p><p>Congratulations! You're fully certified.

</p><p>On this episode of Talk Python To Me, you'll meet Florian Motlik from codeship. He's here to tell us all continuous integration and continuous delivery. Maybe he can help keep you and your team from getting certified, in a bad way!
