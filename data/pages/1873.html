<p>You're collecting money on our behalf (for various values of "our"), without our permission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we are not collecting money on anyone's behalf. We are not affiliated with project owners. Sorry if it confused anybody, we'll fix it in <a href="https://github.com/tip4commit/tip4commit/issues/136" class="issue-link js-issue-link" data-url="https://github.com/tip4commit/tip4commit/issues/136" data-id="46823445" data-error-text="Failed to load issue title" data-permission-text="Issue title is private">#136</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You're talking to our contributors and teasing them with promises of money for their work. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are talking only to contributors that already got some tips.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You're proposing to deliver this money to us without any concern for how we'll receive it, or how we'll account for it in our tax returns (are you going to issue a 1099 for US recipients? Or a group certificate for AU recipients?).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That are small amount tips in Bitcoin, do they even need to be declared? If it were Linden dollars, would they need to be declared too? Recipients don't have to claim the money if they don't want it, I've mentioned it already.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You haven't taken any consideration for how money interacts with the commit process itself - a 1 line typo fix is valued the same as a 2000 line fix correcting a criticial transaction behavior in a database. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don't pay for work, we just distribute a little gratuity from people who want to support the project and possibly attract more attention to it. If the commit is uselsess - don't accept it. If it is useful - why would you care if the contributor received anything for it or not?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time we commit a typo fix, our inbox is spammed by a bunch of emails (instead of, say, accumulating in an account and sending a monthly account statement). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not what tip4commit does. We don't spam bunch of emails. It's pretty rear event when we send out an email, see <a href="https://github.com/tip4commit/tip4commit/blob/master/app/models/tip.rb#L115-L118">https://github.com/tip4commit/tip4commit/blob/master/app/models/tip.rb#L115-L118</a> for details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, making the whole thing laughable, all this is being done to tell us that we've accumulated micro-cents of real money. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This problem has been solved. No notifications about micro-cents anymore.</p>

<p>Well, yes, this project might seem naive, but offensive? Perhaps we made some mistakes that offended people and are sorry for that. But we worked to solve that. It is normal that not all the people like the idea. But I hardly see how it can be offensive.</p>
