<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>About 2 years ago, a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/committees/#conduct">team of people led by Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a> started developing a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> for the Django community. Since that Code was delivered, the same committee has been managing the small number of complaints that have been made.</p>
<p>However, some concerns have been raised about the diversity of the committee - while there's a 50/50 gender split, it's currently all US citizens, and 3 of the 4 are white. There's no representation of non-US, Hispanic, African American, Aboriginal (of any origin), LGBT, or any other diversity group. It's probably not possible to represent <em>every</em> diversity group, but the group would benefit from having more diversity than it currently has.</p>
<p>The tight-knit nature of our community has also led to questions about how to handle conflicts of interest - complaints where someone on the Code of Conduct committee has close ties to the people involved in an incident, or (in a hypothetical worst case) is the subject of a complaint themselves. Our existing policies would benefit from improved procedures regarding the handling of conflicts where such conflicts exist.</p>
<p>A couple of members of the founding committee have also expressed an interest in standing down, so they can focus on other things.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're looking for 3-4 volunteers to address some immediate policy concerns, and longer term, handle reports of Code of Conduct issues.</p>
<p>Code of Conduct issues are obviously sensitive, and we're looking to achieve some specific goals in our representation. If you're interested in volunteer for the Code of Conduct committee, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:foundation@djangoproject.com">please get in touch</a>, and tell us a little about yourself. The DSF board and the existing Code of Conduct committee will review the applicants to find the best fit. We'd also like you to suggest people in the community who you think might be good candidates, but may not see this call for help.</p>

<h3>Grants</h3>
<p>Given the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/jan/27/django-fellowship-fundraising-goal-achieved/">recent success of the fundraising committee</a>, and the impending need to organize grants for this year's DjangoCons, we're asking for volunteers to help us spend some of the money we've raised!</p>
<p>People on this committee will be tasked with determining who gets a financial grant from the DSF. You'll have a budget to spend; in return, you'll be required to develop a set of policies and guidelines for determining grant allocations, and manage the grant application process. There are also some possibilities of collaboration with other groups with Django-related funding goals to ensure that everyone in our community gets as much help as we can give them.</p>
<p>As with the Code of Conduct committee, we need 3-4 volunteers to take on a permanent role of deciding grant policies, and managing the ongoing grant application process.</p>
