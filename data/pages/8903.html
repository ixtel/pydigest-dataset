<p>I am trying to view my locally served site on other devices such as my phone or another laptop. On my current laptop the site works fine, I see everything (frontend) and I get 200s when I visit the site. </p>

<p>However, when I try to access the site with my iphone and second laptop, I do not see any frontend but I do get 200s when I try to access the site. The terminal on my working machine also tells me that there are requests coming in. </p>

<p>I use <code>Django</code> as a backend and I bundle/build my Javascript and CSS with <code>webpack</code> and serve it with <code>webpack-dev-server</code>. </p>

<p>When I run webpack I see this message:</p>

<pre><code>http://0.0.0.0:3000/
webpack result is served from http://localhost:3000/public/bundle/
content is served from ./public
</code></pre>

<p>When I load my webpage on my working machine, the developer tools shows this:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eD812.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eD812.png" alt="enter image description here"/></a></p>

<p>and everything is working. </p>

<p>I run django with this command.</p>

<p><code>$ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</code></p>

<p>My <code>ifconfig</code> gives me:</p>

<p><code>inet 192.168.1.102</code></p>

<p>With my second laptop, I visit <code>192.168.1.102:8000</code> and I see nothing on my page. I get a <code>200</code> on my machine with the site working meaning the requests has gone through. On my second laptop I see this in the developer tools:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tRTAu.png"><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/tRTAu.png" alt="enter image description here"/></a></p>

<p>Notice it doesnt have <code>/public/</code> in the <code>src</code> and <code>href</code></p>

<p>On my second machine if I visit <code>192.168.1.102:3000</code> I see an Interface and I am able to click around to <code>192.168.1.102:3000/bundle/main.js</code> and see my webpack built javascript. </p>

<p>On my second machine, I tried to change the src and href in my developer tools to <code>192.168.1.102:3000/bundle/main.js</code>. However nothing would change and I still see a blank screen</p>

<p>Here is a <code>gist</code> of my webpack config:</p>
