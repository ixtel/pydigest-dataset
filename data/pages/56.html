<html><body><div><div class="entry-content"><p>Today Jari and Brian explained a whole bunch of things to me about networks!
It was fantastic. It’s amazing to have people with so much experience to ask
questions.</p>
<p>At the end they mentioned that I should look up how <code>traceroute</code> works and
that it’s a pretty popular networking-job-interview question. And I’d just
discovered this super cool Python networking library called
<a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a> which lets you construct
packets really easily. So I thought I’d implement traceroute using scapy!</p>
<p>I thought it would take a long time, but turns out that (a basic version) is
really easy.</p>
<p>So using scapy, you can create IP and UDP packets like this:</p>
<pre><code>from scapy.all import *
ip_packet = IP(dst="hackerschool.com", ttl=10)
udp_packet = UDP(dport=40000)
full_packet = IP(dst="hackerschool.com", ttl=10) / UDP(dport=40000)
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can send a packet like this:</p>
<p><code>
send(full_packet)
</code></p>
<p>So IP packets have a <code>ttl</code> attribute, which stands for “Time-To-Live”. Every
time a machine receives an IP packet, it decreases the <code>ttl</code> by 1 and passes
it on. Basically this is a super smart way to make sure that packets don’t get
into infinite loops.</p>
<p>If a packet’s <code>ttl</code> runs out before it replies, the last machine sends back an
ICMP packet saying “sorry, failed!”.</p>
<p>To implement traceroute, we send out a UDP packet with <code>ttl=i</code> for <code>i =
1,2,3,...</code>. Then we look at the reply packet and see if it’s a “Time ran out”
or “That port doesn’t exist” error message. In the first case, we keep going,
and in the second case we’re done.</p>
<p>Here’s the code! It’s 16 lines including comments and everything.</p>
<pre><code>from scapy.all import *
hostname = "google.com"
for i in range(1, 28):
    pkt = IP(dst=hostname, ttl=i) / UDP(dport=33434)
    # Send the packet and get a reply
    reply = sr1(pkt, verbose=0)
    if reply is None:
        # No reply =(
        break
    elif reply.type == 3:
        # We've reached our destination
        print "Done!", reply.src
        break
    else:
        # We're in the middle somewhere
        print "%d hops away: " % i , reply.src
</code></pre>
<p>The output looks like:</p>
<pre>
<code>
1 hops away:  192.168.1.1
2 hops away:  24.103.20.129
3 hops away:  184.152.112.73
4 hops away:  184.152.112.73
5 hops away:  107.14.19.22
...
</code>
</pre>
<p>So it turns out traceroute is kind of easy! Apparently the difference between
traceroute on Windows and Unix is that Unix generally sends UDP packets and
Windows sends ICMP packets.</p>
<p>There’s also <code>tcptraceroute</code> which, well, sends TCP packets.</p>
