Capacitive touch breakout boards are an excellent way to use household objects as inputs on your Raspberry Pi. Any conductive object can act as a switch when connected to sensor boards, including potatoes, apples, spoons and pencil graphite. <br/>
</p>

<p class="row-fluid build-text">
The capacitive touch sensors detect when you touch the board's pad or an object connected to the board. Humans carry a small electrical charge. When you touch a capacitive touch sensor it will detect this charge. <br/><br/>With some simple wiring to the Raspberry Pi and a few lines of Python, you've got a fun and easy way to control your projects and games. For
example at the end of this guide we'll show you how to control
Minecraft: Pi Edition using a apples.<br/><br/>There are three breakout boards that this guide will show you how to use with your Raspberry Pi.

It is very similar to the momentary board, but includes more inputs. Unlike the other boards it does not have any pads, instead the pins on the right of the board are used to detect touch. These pins can be connected to wires, which can be attached to everyday objects, like bananas.</p></div></td>
