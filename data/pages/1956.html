<p><strong>Therefore, the theoretical aspects are a little bit brief, but nonetheless, here is a short introduction of what it is all about.</strong></p>
<p>Complete linkage is one implementation of <em>hierarchical agglomerative clustering</em>. The principle of hierarchical agglomerative clustering is to start with a singleton cluster, and clusters are iteratively merged until one single cluster remains. This results in a "cluster tree," which is also called <em>dendrogram</em>. The opposite approach -- starting with one cluster and divide into clusters until only singleton clusters remain -- is called <em>divisive hierarchical clustering</em>.</p>
<p>The algorithm can be summarized via the following pseudocode</p>
<hr/>

<p>1: Compute a distance or similarity matrix.<br/>
2: Each data point is represented as a singleton cluster.<br/>
3: <strong>Repeat</strong><br/>
4:         Merge two closest clusters (e.g., based on distance between most similar or dissimilar members).<br/>
5:         Update the distance (or similarity) matrix.<br/>
6: <strong>Until</strong> one single cluster remains.</p>
<hr/>

<p>Complete linkage compares the most dissimilar members between clusters in each iteration. The two clusters which have the most similar <em>dissimilar members</em> are merged into a new cluster.<br/>
\begin{equation}
d(C,D) = \max[dist(C_i, D_j)]
\end{equation}
for all $i$  points in cluster $C$ and $j$ points in cluster $D$.</p>
<p>In contrast, the <em>single linkage</em> algorithm compares the two most similar members instead of the most dissimilar ones.
\begin{equation}
d(C,D) = \min[dist(C_i, D_j)]
\end{equation}
for all $i$  points in cluster $C$ and $j$ points in cluster $D$.</p>
