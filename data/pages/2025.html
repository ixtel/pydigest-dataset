It allows you to model a broad range of random phenomenons, like dice throwing, coin tossing, cards hands, gambling, lottery, ... with fair or unfair characteristics! More generally, Lea may be used for any finite set of discrete values having known probability: numbers, boolean variables (true/false), date/times, symbols, ... Each distribution is modeled as a plain object, which can be named, displayed, queried or processed to produce new distribution objects.<br/>
