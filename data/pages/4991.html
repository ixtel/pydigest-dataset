<p>The Django core team is thrilled to announce the addition of <a class="reference external" href="https://hauru.eu">Tomek Paczkowski</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/prestontimmons">Preston Timmons</a>.</p>
<p>Tomek has been active in the Django community for many years. He has organized many sprints, helped organize <a class="reference external" href="http://love.djangocircus.com">DjangoCon Europe 2013</a>, mentored at many <a class="reference external" href="http://djangogirls.org">Django Girls</a> events, and helped with the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com">djangoproject.com</a> redesign effort. Originally from Poland, Tomek currently lives in London, where he works at <a class="reference external" href="http://squirrel.me">Squirrel</a>.</p>
<p>Preston is a software developer with a background in mathematics. He has been contributing code to Django since at least 2010. He has contributed in many areas, notably including the discovery test runner and the Django template language.</p>
<p>We are very grateful for all of Tomek and Preston's contributions, and look forward to working with them on the Django core team.</p>
