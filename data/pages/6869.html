<p>You do not need to understand object oriented programming to making use of test classes. They are a way of organizing code and they allow a granularity between module and function. This episode covers some of the confusion around using test classes, and a few benefits of using classes.</p>

<h2>What’s the bonus prize?</h2>
<p>One of the challenging things I’ve done in my career is transitioning from engineering to leadership. I’ve been a team lead for a couple of years now. It’s like being a manager an engineer at the same time.</p>
<p>One of the best books that have helped me through the transition is <a href="http://leadingsnowflakes.com/">Leading Snowflakes</a> by Oren Ellenbogen. Get it, software developers are all different, like snowflakes. It’s a great book and I recommend it, even for non-managers.</p>
<p>I contacted Oren about including the book in this contest, and he agreed to it.</p>
<p>So, in early November, I’m going to pick one person from all of the entries.<br/>
This will be a random selection.</p>
<p>They will receive:<br/>
1. My eBook, if they don’t already have it.<br/>
2. Oren’s “Leading Snowflakes”, in PDF, mobi, epub.<br/>
3. Ten interviews he has done with managers from Yammer, Twitter, HubSpot, Khan Academy, SoundCloud, New Relic, Netflix, Etsy, Quora, and Palantir (I don’t know how to pronounce that, but it’s Michael Lopp, Rands himself, great interview.)</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch to Oren for donating this.</p>
<p>I’ll announce the winner of this bonus prize early in November.<br/>
Entries through the 31st of October.</p>
