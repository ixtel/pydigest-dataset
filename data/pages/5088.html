<h2>Security advisory: simple_tag does not do auto-escaping</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Luke Plant</strong> on June 29, 2015 </span>

<p>As per our <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/custom-template-tags/#auto-escaping-considerations">documentation</a>, the <tt class="docutils literal">simple_tag</tt> decorator used for creating custom template tags does not run auto-escaping on its contents (up to and including Django 1.8). The team has noticed, however, that this makes it very easy to introduce XSS vulnerabilities when using <tt class="docutils literal">simple_tag</tt>, and we have found examples of vulnerable code in the wild.</p>
<p>For this reason, Django 1.9 will change this behavior to improve security. In the mean time, all users are encouraged to check every usage of <tt class="docutils literal">simple_tag</tt> in their own template tags and ensure they are not vulnerable, as per the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.9/#simple-tag-conditional-escape-fix">instructions in the 1.9 release notes</a>.</p>
