<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>First off, we'd like to tell you about the upcoming 2015 Python Education Summit in Montréal, Canada. There's going to be an array of talks on Python and Education prior to PyCon 2015's main conference! A full description of each talk will be coming soon, but at the moment you can check out the Education Summit <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/events/edusummit/schedule/">schedule </a> and <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-pycon-2015-education-summit-tickets-15029161627">register</a> for the conference.</p>

<p>After getting your feedback on a <a href="http://www.checkio.org/blog/new-python-try-some-free-online-courses-help-you-l/">previous</a> blog entry regarding Python learning resources, we’ve decided to write an additional «courses and books» roundup, but make it more Python 3 oriented!</p>
<p>As you may know, Python is one of the most <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">popular</a> programming languages, and definitely is one of the most flexible and beginner friendly.

This is why we’re providing you a great list of useful materials that you can use to improve your Python-fu!</p>

<p>One thing that never gets old is official <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">Python Tutorial</a>. It gives you basic level of understanding what’s happening in those magical “*.py” files and why do you need to use so many whitespaces. It also introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs.</p>
