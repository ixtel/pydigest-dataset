<p><a href="https://temporal.pw/">Temporal.pw</a> provides temporary secure storage for passwords so you can safely transmit them over insecure channels like E-Mail, Instant Messaging, SMS, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>Passwords are only ever stored after being encrypted with random 16-byte AES encryption key.</li>
<li>The AES decryption keys are <em>never</em> stored on the server side, each unique temporary URL holds the actual decription key required to decrypt the password.</li>
<li>The encrypted passwords are immediately <em>permanently</em> deleted from the database whenever any one of these conditions occur:

<ul>
<li>The user clicks the "Delete now" link.</li>
<li>The unique URL is visited after the expiration time.</li>
<li>The unique URL is visited more times than the user allowed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expired encrypted passwords are never visible to anyone after their expiration time and are permanently deleted from the database within 1 hour of their expiration.</li>
<li>You can optionally restrict unique temporary password URLs so that they're only accessible from your same IP address (useful for sending passwords securely to someone in the same network).</li>
<li>Hosted entirely on Google App Engine servers.</li>
<li>Only ~150 lines of python code.</li>
<li>Uses standard <a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto</a> library for encryption.</li>
</ul>
