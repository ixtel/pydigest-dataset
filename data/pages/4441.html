<html><body><div><div class="field-item even" property="schema:articleBody content:encoded"><p>Minecraft is a hugely popular game that runs on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and even smartphones. It's the best-selling PC game of all time and has become a worldwide sensation with obsessive players around the world, a large online community, and a vast array of merchandise. Many people enjoy building complicated structures and even creating their own interactive systems using only the mechanics of the game.</p>

<p>The free Raspberry Pi version of the game is the only one that comes with a programming interface, allowing players write code and manipulate the world around them. It's based on Minecraft Pocket Edition for Android, and a Python API is provided. It's bundled with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspbian</a>, the Pi's main supported distribution, and it's being used to teach programming skills to young people around the world.</p>
<p>You can explore the Minecraft world with your mouse and keyboard, place blocks and build things manually, but the fun really starts when you open up a Python window alongside Minecraft and start sending commands into the world.</p>

<h2>Minecraft Python API</h2>
<p>So, what can you do from the Python API?</p>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>Get your player's coordinates, and use these to teleport to another location in the worldwide.</p>
<h3>Blocks</h3>
<p>Set a block at a particular set of coordinates (perhaps right in front of your player), or set multiple blocks in a cube or cuboid. There are 70 block types available, including stone, grass, dirt, water, lava, snow, ice, flower, melon, and TNT.</p>
<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>Use infinite loops to keep placing blocks behind your player as he walks or build a house and get it to follow you wherever you go.</p>
<h3>Viewpoint</h3>
<p>Change the “camera” viewpoint, i.e. how you view the world.</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>Keep track of what has happened to a particular block, and use events to trigger other actions.</p>
<h3>Explosive TNT</h3>
<p>The TNT blocks can be activated by the player hitting one with a sword.</p>

<p>With this set of functionality available, it is possible to create amazing structures autonomously, create games and interactive applications. Combined, the functions can be used in interesting and imaginative ways.</p>

<h2>Minecraft in Education</h2>
<p>We've found this version of Minecraft to be a valuable learning tool that gives young people the chance to learn programming in a domain they can relate to, and one which motivates them to use code to solve problems.</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Minecraft has been pre-installed in Raspbian for about a year now, so you may already have it.</p>
<p>If you have an older Raspbian image, just run:</p>
<p><span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text"> sudo apt-get update&lt;br&gt; sudo apt-get install minecraft-pi&lt;br&gt; </code></span></p>
