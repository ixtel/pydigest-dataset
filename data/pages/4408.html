<h4 class="center">Talk voting was open from Monday, May 4, until Friday, May 15.</h4>

<p/>
<p><strong>Talk voting is closed !</strong></p>

<p>Thank you to all attendees who participated. We received almost 11.700 individual votes for over 300 submissions.</p>

<h3>How talk voting works</h3>

<p>In order to participate in the talk voting your need to be a registered attendee. Please log in and then proceed to this page to enter the talk voting page.</p>

<p>The talk voting page lists all submitted proposals, including talks, trainings and posters.</p>

<p>At the top of the page you find a few filters you can use to narrow down the list by e.g. selecting tags you're interested in or only show one type of proposal and also to select the sorting order.</p>

<p>For each submission, you can find the talk title with a link to the talk page, a star bar for voting and the abstract link (which opens when you click on it).</p>

<p>In order to vote, have a look at the title/abstract and then select the number of stars you want to give the talk submission. A higher number of stars rates it higher. If you want to remove your vote again, click on the small minus sign in front of the star bar.</p>

<p>If you have questions about the talk, you can go to the talk page and enter a comment.</p>

<p>Note that your votes are automatically saved to the backend without the need to click on a save or submit button.</p>

<h3>Talk selection</h3>

<p>After the talk voting phase, the EuroPython Program Workgroup (WG) will use the votes to select the talks and build a schedule.</p>

<p>The majority of the talks will be chosen based on the talk voting results. Part of the available slots will be assigned directly Program WG based on editorial criteria to e.g. increase diversity or give a chance to less mainstream topics.</p>

<p>In general, the Program WG will try to give as many speakers a chance to talk as possible. If speakers have submitted multiple talks, the one with the highest rate will most likely get selected.</p>

<h3>Schedule announcement</h3>

<p>We hope to have the schedule announced by the end of May. As always, we will make this announcement on our <a href="/en/social-media/" class=" ">usual news channels</a>.</p>
