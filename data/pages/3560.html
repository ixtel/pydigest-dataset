<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on March 6, 2015 </span>

<p>About a month ago, the Django Software Foundation sent out a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/feb/06/call-applicants-django-fellowship/">call for applicants</a> for a full-time, ongoing Django Fellow. Today, we're proud to announce the successful applicant: Tim Graham.</p>
<p>Tim is already well known to the Django community. He's been a member of the core team for several years, and for the last 18 months has been a major contributor, reviewing and merging pull requests. He was also one of the Django Fellows during the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/oct/13/announcing-inaugural-django-fellows/">fellowship pilot program</a>.</p>
<p>The Django Fellowship is funded through the generous contributions of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">donors like you</a>! If you or your company would like to contribute to the ongoing success of the Fellowship program, please visit our <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">donations page</a>. If you'd like to make a larger contribution, or your company is interested in becoming a corporate member of the Django Software Foundation, please <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/contact/foundation/">get in touch</a>.</p>
