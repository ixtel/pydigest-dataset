<h2>Security releases issued</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on March 18, 2015 </span>

<p>In accordance with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/">our security release policy</a>, the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.20, 1.6.11, 1.7.7 and 1.8c1. These releases are now available on PyPI and our download page. These releases address several security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch has also been updated.</p>
<p>Django 1.8 is now at release candidate stage. This marks the string freeze and the call for translators <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/localizing/#translations">to submit translations</a>. Provided no major bugs are discovered that can't be solved in the next two weeks, 1.8 final will be issued on or around April 1. Any delays will be communicated on the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/74_MZK27TAE/discussion">django-developers mailing list thread</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-mitigated-possible-xss-attack-via-user-supplied-redirect-urls">
<h3>Mitigated possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs</h3>
<p>Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.views.login</tt> and i18n)
to redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security checks for these
redirects (namely <tt class="docutils literal">django.utils.http.is_safe_url()</tt>) accepted URLs with
leading control characters and so considered URLs like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\x08javascript:...</span></tt>
safe. This issue doesn't affect Django currently, since we only put this URL
into the <tt class="docutils literal">Location</tt> response header and browsers seem to ignore JavaScript
there. Browsers we tested also treat URLs prefixed with control characters such
as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%08//example.com</span></tt> as relative paths so redirection to an unsafe target
isn't a problem either.</p>
<p>However, if a developer relies on <tt class="docutils literal">is_safe_url()</tt> to
provide safe redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could
suffer from an XSS attack as some browsers such as Google Chrome ignore control
characters at the start of a URL in an anchor <tt class="docutils literal">href</tt>.</p>
<p>Thanks Daniel Chatfield for reporting the issue.</p>
<p>This issue has been assigned the identifier CVE-2015-2317.</p>
