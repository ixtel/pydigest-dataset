<p>A python package that helps run tox remotely</p>








<p>Remote testing of python environments (that use <cite>tox</cite>).</p>
<div id="what-this-does">
<h2>What this does</h2>
<ol>
<li>Acquires a lock to ensure simultaneous repositories are not being tested.</li>
<li>Connects to (randomly selected if multiple are given) remote machine (ssh
keys need to be setup to allow this to happen in a non-intrusive way).</li>
<li>Archives the current working directory into a tarball.</li>
<li>Sends this tarball to the remote machine (after removing any
old or previous tarballs, test environments…).</li>
<li>Runs <cite>tox</cite> on the remote machine, proxying the stderr/stdout to the
local stderr/stdout (making it look like the output of that remote
program is actually local).</li>
<li>Returns the remote <cite>tox</cite> programs exit code as the local programs exit
code (making it look like the remote programs exit code was the local
programs exit code).</li>
