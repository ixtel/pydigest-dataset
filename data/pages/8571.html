I was checking out the </p><b>repr()</b><p> and </p><b>__repr__()</b><p> functions / methods of Python (in the process of creating an exercise for one of my students), when I came across this interesting </p><i>'feature'</i><p> of Python:
</p><p>
I did this at the Python interpreter prompt (in both 2.7 and 3.4):
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.__repr__()  # Call the </p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.in/2015/03/dunderdoc-simple-python-introspection.html">dunder</a><p> repr method on an empty string.</p><p>
"''"</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p><p>
(Got the expected output - the representation of the empty string.)
</p><p>
Similarly for a list, a tuple, etc.:
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; [].__repr__()</p><p>
'[]'

</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ().__repr__()</p><p>
'()'
</p><p>
But when I did this:
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 42.__repr__()
</p><p>
I got this:
</p><p>
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1</p><p>
42.__repr__()</p><p>
^</p><p>
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</p><p>
So, it looks like Python does not know the </p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">meaning</a><p> of </p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life">life</a><p> :-)

</p><p/><hr/><p/><p>Jokes apart, I also tried this (actually, before trying 42):
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.0.__repr__()</p><p>
'1.0'
</p><p>
which worked. And the only difference between the example above that worked (</p><b>1.0</b><p>), and the two that did not (</p><b>1</b><p> or </p><b>42</b><p>), is that the latter two use an </p><b>int</b><p>, and the former uses a number with a </p><b>decimal point</b><p>.
</p><p>
But both also use the dot as the </p><b>attribute access operator</b><p>, which leads me to think that this is the reason for the issue (for ints): there is an ambiguity between interpreting </p><b>1.something</b><p> as </p><b>1.other_decimal_digits</b><p> (making it a floating point number) and as </p><b>1.some_attribute</b><p> (making it an attribute access on an object) (because 1, like (almost) everything in Python, is an object (of type int), as can be seen by doing:
</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(1)</p><p>
and</p><p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(1)
</p><p>
Interested to know if anyone has a better explanation of this, and also of whether the same issue/anomaly, if it is one, occurs in any other languages, or if not, why not.
