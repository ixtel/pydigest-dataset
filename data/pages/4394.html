	<p><a href="http://london.pydata.org/">PyDataLondon 2015</a> will take place June 19-21 at Bloomberg’s HQ in Central London, we’ll have 300 people, multiple tracks and a very solid set of speakers and teachers. You should come. You should probably speak and share your knowledge. In fact – you should submit a talk to our <a href="http://london.pydata.org/">Call for Proposals</a>, it <em>opens this weekend and closes May 18th</em> So You Don’t Have Long!</p>
<p>We have a set of Themes for the talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical and Bioinformatics</li>
<li>Tools (libraries, IDEs, hardware – whatever feels like a tool)</li>
<li>FinTech and Economics</li>
<li>Ecommerce and AdTech</li>
<li>Other goodies (including Art, Open Data, Data Journalism, NGOs, Gaming, IoTs and Robotics – but open to whatever you think is going to be interesting)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three topics are definitely of interest to companies in London, Tooling is important to everyone and the “Other goodies” theme is the catch-all for stuff that’s of interest beyond the normal body of companies we know about. The CfP is only open for less than 3 weeks so don’t hang around! Get a title and short abstract down on paper first and then you can fill in the rest online easily enough.</p>
<p>This conference builds upon PyDataLondon 2014 Conference, we <a href="http://ianozsvald.com/2014/02/24/pydatalondon-2014/">had 200 people last year</a> at the top of Canary Wharf last year. This year we’ll be 50% bigger and in the centre of London. You want to come along!</p>
<p><em>Please forward this around to people who will find it interesting!</em> We’re keen to have an even wider community than our usual <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/">1,400 PyDataLondon meetup</a> members, we’re friendly for non-Python talks (<em>data science </em>is our focus) and we’d love submissions from people around R, SAS, Julia, Hadoop and the like. Our CfP review committee is 50% female, 50% male, more industrial than academic and they’re all deeply active in the field. We want speakers covering beginner, intermediate and expert data science topics, don’t hold off if you’ve never spoken before, we’d love for you to get involved.</p>
<p>If you’re hiring then you’ll probably <a href="http://pydata.org/sponsor/info/">want to sponsor</a> – we’ve already closed the first few sponsorship slots and the next set are under discussion so you should <a href="http://pydata.org/sponsor/info/">get in touch</a> quickly. By sponsoring you’ll be visible to our 300 world-class actively-practising data scientists and you’ll get to meet the creative academic minds and active businesses in our London data science community. Seriously, you should sponsor and get involved, don’t hang around or you’ll be left with that little table at the end of the corridor and you <em>don’t want that!</em></p>
<p>If you’re interested in the above then you might also be interested in <a href="http://www.pycon.se/">PyConSweden</a> (May 12-13) – I’m giving the Opening Keynote on Data Science Deployed (it’ll be written up here later) and there’s a set of very nice data science talks in the schedule. Very shortly after we’ll have <a href="http://pydata.berlin/">PyDataBerlin</a> on May 29-30 in the heart of Berlin, go grab your tickets before they sell out.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t make our conferences do please join our monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/">PyDataLondon meetup</a> and get involved in our very active community. You’ll find slides from past presenters in the Comments for each of the meetups.</p>
