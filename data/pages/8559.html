<html><body><div><div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because <code>find_all()</code> returns a set of results. Use a for loop to iterate through each returned element:</p>

<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
req=requests.get("http://www.aflcio.org/Legislation-and-Politics/Legislative-Alerts")
data=req.text
soup=BeautifulSoup(data)
letters=soup.find_all("div",class_="ec_statements")
for letter in letters:
   print(letter.encode('utf-8'))
   print(letter.text)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>.text</code> function, which gives you the text of the found element and handles encoding automatically.</p>

<p>When using <code>.find()</code> you get a single element as a result and can print it out, <code>.findAll()</code> (or usually written in Python as <code>.find_all()</code>) returns a set of elements, which has no function <code>.encode()</code> since it's a Unicode object.</p>

<p>Another possible solution is to write <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> at the beginning of your script.</p>

<p><code>print(letters)</code> worked for me after writing <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> at the beginning of the script, it also worked for me without it, but I am using Python 2.7</p>
