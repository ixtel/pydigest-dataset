<html><body><div><div class="content"><p>A few weeks ago I talked with a friend studying computer science who I
discovered had never experienced the joy of programming with a high
level language. Not only that but he didn't have the first clue what he
was missing. I feared without my immediate intervention another
perfectly good mind would be wasted in programming hell. At his
university they were using Java for nearly everything so he had somehow
gotten the terribly mistaken idea that it didn't really matter what
programming language one used. I carefully explained that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Programming languages were not equivalent. Not by a longshot.</li>
<li>Java is rarely the language of choice for really good programmers</li>
<li>The two languages I recommend taking a close look at are Python and
Lisp.</li>
</ol>
<p>He had never heard of Python or Lisp before so I helpfully provided a
list of links to resources that would hopefully help get him started.
Then I figured I'd share those resources with the community for the
benefit of other misguided programmers in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>Also, next time this issue comes up I won't have to waste any breath
proselytizing. I'll just point to this blog post.</p>

<h2>Paul Graham</h2>
<p>Paul Graham has written extensively about this stuff. Listen to this
guy, he really gets it.</p>

<p>He's also written a book ("On Lisp") you can buy or download for free:</p>
