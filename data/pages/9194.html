<p>Python package for interactive data visualization</p>








<p>Welcome! <strong>psyplot</strong> is a open source python project that mainly combines the
plotting utilities of <a href="http://matplotlib.org" rel="nofollow">matplotlib</a> and the data management of the <a href="http://xarray.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">xarray</a>
package. The main purpose however is to have a framework that allows a  fast,
attractive, flexible, easily applicable, easily reproducible and especially
an interactive visualization of your data.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to help scientiests and especially climate model
developers in their daily work by providing a flexibel visualization tool that
can be enhanced by their own visualization scripts.</p>
<p>The package is very new and there are many features that will be included in
the near future. So we are very pleased for feedback! Please simply raise an issue
on <a href="https://github.com/Chilipp/psyplot" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You can see the full documentation on
