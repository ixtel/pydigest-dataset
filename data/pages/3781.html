<h1>Vim</h1>
<p>Vim, short for Vi IMproved, is a configurable text editor often used as
a Python development environment. Vim proponents commonly cite the numerous
plugins, Vimscript and logical command language as major Vim strengths.</p>
<h2>Why is Vim a good Python development environment?</h2>
<p>Vim's philosophy is that developers are more productive when they avoid
taking their hands off the keyboard. Code should flow naturally from the
developer's thoughts through the keyboard and onto the screen. Using a mouse
or other peripheral is a detriment to the rate at which a developer's
thoughts become code.</p>
<p>Vim has a logical, structured command language. When a beginner is learning
the editor she may feel like it is impossible to understand all the key
commands. However, the commands stack together in a logical way so that over
time the editor becomes predictable.</p>

<h2>Configuring Vim with a Vimrc file</h2>
<p>The Vimrc file is used to configure the Vim editor. A Vimrc file can range
from nothing in it to very complicated with hundreds or thousands of lines
of configuration commands.</p>
<p>Here's a short, commented example .vimrc file I use for Python development
to get a feel for some of the configuration statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>" enable syntax highlighting
syntax enable

" show line numbers
set number

" set tabs to have 4 spaces
set ts=4

" indent when moving to the next line while writing code
set autoindent

" expand tabs into spaces
set expandtab

" when using the &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; commands, shift lines by 4 spaces
set shiftwidth=4

" show a visual line under the cursor's current line
set cursorline

" show the matching part of the pair for [] {} and ()
set showmatch

" enable all Python syntax highlighting features
let python_highlight_all = 1
</pre></div>
<p>Here is how these configuration options look with a dark background on
Mac OS X while editing the markdown for this webpage (how meta!).</p>
<p><img src="/img/vim-dark-bg.jpg" alt="Vim with basic configuration options on a dark background." class="technical-diagram"/></p>
<p>Take a look at another example using these configuration options, this time
with a light background and editing Python code from my
<a href="https://github.com/makaimc/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations">Choose Your Own Adventures Presentations</a>
project.</p>
<p><img src="/img/vim-white-bg.png" alt="Vim with basic configuration options on a white background." class="technical-diagram"/></p>
<p>The Vimrc file lives under the home directory of the user account running
Vim. For example, when my user account is 'matt', on Mac OS X my Vimrc
file is found at <code>/Users/matt/.vimrc</code>. On Ubuntu Linux my .vimrc file
can be found within the <code>/home/matt/</code> directory.</p>
<p>If a Vimrc file does not already exist, just create it within the user's
home directory and it will be picked up by Vim the next time you open the
editor.</p>
<h2>Vim tutorials</h2>
<p>Vim has a reputation for a difficult learning curve, but it's much easier
to get started with these tutorials.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">Vim Adventures</a> is a cute, fun browser-based
game that helps you learn Vim commands by playing through the adventure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">Learn Vim Progressively</a>
is a wonderful tutorial that follows the path I took when learning Vim:
learn just enough to survive with it as your day-to-day editor then begin
adding more advanced commands on top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/">A vim Tutorial and Primer</a> is an
incredibly deep study in how to go from beginner to knowledgeable in Vim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://benmccormick.org/2014/07/02/learning-vim-in-2014-vim-as-language/">Vim as a Language</a>
explains the language syntax and how you can build up over time to master
the editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/installing-and-using-the-vim-text-editor-on-a-cloud-server">How to install and use Vim on a cloud server</a>
along with <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-vim-for-advanced-editing-of-plain-text-or-code-on-a-vps--2">How to use Vim for advanced editing of code on a VPS</a>
are two detailed Digital Ocean guides for getting up and running with Vim,
regardless of whether you're using it locally or on a cloud server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/2011/12/vim-revisited/">Vim: revisited</a> the
author explains his on-again off-again relationship with using Vim. He then
shows how he configures and uses the editor so it sticks as his primary
code editing tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vimrc resources</h2>
<p>These are a few resources for learning how to structure a <code>.vimrc</code> file. I
recommend adding configuration options one at a time to test them
individually instead of going whole hog with a Vimrc you are unfamiliar with.</p>

<h2>Vim installation guides</h2>
<p>These installation guides will help you get Vim up and running on Mac OS X,
Linux and Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://prioritized.net/blog/upgrading-vim-on-os-x/">Upgrading Vim on OS X</a>
explains why to upgrade from Vim 7.2 to 7.3+ and how to do it using
<a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The easiest way to install Vim on Windows 7+ is to download and run the
<a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc">gvim74.exe</a> file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Linux make sure to install the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vim">vim package</a> with
<code>sudo apt-get install vim</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're using PyCharm as your IDE you won't need to install Vim as a
separate text editor - instead use the
<a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164">IdeaVim</a> PyCharm plugin to get
Vim keybindings, visual/insert mode, configuration with ~/.ideavimrc and
other Vim emulation features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using Vim as a Python IDE</h2>
<p>Once you get comfortable with Vim as an editor, there are several
configuration options and plugins you can use to enhance your Python
productivity. These are the resources and tutorials to read when you're
ready to take that step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/">VIM and Python - a Match Made in Heaven</a> details how to set up a powerful VIM environment geared towards wrangling Python day in and day out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/klen/python-mode">python-mode</a> project is a Vim
plugin with syntax highlighting, breakpoints, PEP8 linting, code completion
and many other features you'd expect from an integrated development
environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://haridas.in/vim-as-your-ide.html">Vim as Your IDE</a> discusses how to
set up Vim for greater productivity once you learn the initial Vim language
for using the editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://unlogic.co.uk/2013/02/08/vim-as-a-python-ide/">Vim as a Python IDE</a>
goes through the steps necessary to make Vim into a more comfortable
environment for Python development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9172802/setting-up-vim-for-python">Setting up Vim for Python</a>
has a well written answer on Stack Overflow for getting started with Vim.</p>
