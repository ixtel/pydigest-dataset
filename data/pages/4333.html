<h2>A birthday party for Django</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Jacob Kaplan-Moss</strong> on April 29, 2015 </span>

<p>It's hard to believe, but Django was released nearly <strong>ten years ago</strong> -- here's
the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2005/jul/14/prelaunch/">very first entry on this
blog</a>, which was
published in July of 2005.</p>
<p>Ten years is a big milestone, so we're throwing a <a class="reference external" href="https://djangobirthday.com">birthday party</a> in the town where Django was created,
Lawrence, Kansas.</p>
<p>The party will be July 10th-12th, 2015. We'll have great food, a great lineup of
speakers on Saturday, and a big birthday party Saturday night. We'll be
announcing more details soon -- who's speaking, what the party's all about --
but trust me: it's going to be awesome.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://djangobirthday.com">Tickets are available now</a>, and are only $90.
They won't last long, so if you want one, move quickly.</p>
<p>More information is available on the website, including more about the
<a class="reference external" href="https://djangobirthday.com/schedule">schedule</a>, our
<a class="reference external" href="https://djangobirthday.com/speak">call for speakers</a>,
a <a class="reference external" href="https://djangobirthday.com/travel">travel guide</a>, and more.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>
