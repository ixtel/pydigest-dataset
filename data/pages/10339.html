<span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/" target="_blank">PEP 0515 -- Underscores in Numeric Literals</a></span><br/>
This PEP proposes to extend Python's syntax so that underscores can be used in integral, floating-point and complex number literals. This is a common feature of other modern languages, and can aid readability of long literals, or literals whose value should clearly separate into parts, such as bytes or words in hexadecimal notation.

Ever tried to get into data science or machine learning, but struggled with getting your tech stack working, or found the maths off-putting? Curious about the limits of what your laptop or desktop really are when it comes to Big Data and predictive analytics? Ever wondered if these tools were really accessible to a general developer? This talk will provide attendees with a walkthrough on getting set up for this work, and an overview of a good tech stack / software ecosystem for beginning work. We'll cover some of the standard data sets in machine learning, and how to apply interesting algorithms. Random Forests and neural networks will be included, but with a minimum of fuss and jargon. <br/>

What is the role, the core purpose of writing tests for you application? Should you write more unit tests and fewer integration tests, or is it actually the other way around? You may have heard of the test pyramid with unit tests building the foundation. In this episode we talk about a variation on that theme called the test column. <br/>

<span><a href="http://podcastinit.com/wsgi-2.html" target="_blank">Podcast.__init__ Episode 43 - WSGI 2.0</a></span><br/>
The Web Server Gateway Interface, or WSGI for short, is a long-standing pillar of the Python ecosystem. It has enabled a vast number of web frameworks to proliferate by not having to worry about how exactly to interact with the HTTP protocol and focus instead on building a library that is robust, extensible, and easy to use. With recent evolutions to how we interact with the web, it appears that WSGI may be in need of an update and that is what our guests on this episode came to discuss. <br/>

In this post, we're going to learn how to deal with valid and invalid numbers using the Twilio Python library. This code could work in any context whether you use it to look up customer numbers in your production Django app or just have a basic script you want to run to check numbers in a local database. <br/>

In this post, I will show how to build a scatter plot matrix that is “spiked” with some boxplots to highlight some useful statistics. I will proceed step by step. First I will explain how to prepare the dataset for plotting. Then I’ll explain how to plot a scatterplot and a boxplot using basic plotly syntax. Finally, I’ll show you how to put all the pieces together to build the final plot. If you want to jump straight to the plotting, just skip the Getting to know the dataset and Simplification of the dataset sections and go to Isolated Scatterplot.<br/>

This book covers the long awaited Scrapy v 1.0 that empowers you to extract useful data from virtually any source with very little effort. It starts off by explaining the fundamentals of Scrapy framework, followed by a thorough description of how to extract data from any source, clean it up, shape it as per your requirement using Python and 3rd party APIs. Next you will be familiarised with the process of storing the scrapped data in databases as well as search engines and performing real time analytics on them with Spark Streaming. By the end of this book, you will perfect the art of scarping data for your applications with ease.<br/>

Scrapy with beta Python 3 support is finally here with Scrapy 1.1.0rc1 release. This is a huge milestone for all you Scrapy users (and those who haven't used Scrapy due to the lack of Python 3). Scrapy veterans and new adopters will soon be able to move their entire stack to Python 3 once the release becomes stable. Keep in mind that since this a release candidate, it is not ready to be used in production.<br/>
