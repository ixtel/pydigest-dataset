<p>Folks,
  I need to have the python script read in the files that have changed since the last git commit.  Using GitPython, how would I get the same output as running from cli:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>I can do something like the following, however, I only need the file names:</p>

<pre><code>hcommit = repo.head.commit
for diff_added in hcommit.diff('HEAD~1').iter_change_type('A'):
    print(diff_added)    
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks!</p>
