<p>While I can't answer the <em>why</em> that I think is your primary question, I can offer a solution to get around the problem if it's causing problems. The short version is just to specify exactly what version you want, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>trevor@nikola:~$ pip list --outdated | grep Django
Django (Current: 1.7.5 Latest: 1.7.6)
pip install -U Django==1.7.6
</code></pre>

<p>This is especially useful if you're creating something and you want to specify dependencies that remain static so you don't have to update your code if an underlying dependency changes. </p>

<p>Sometimes you're not sure which version is appropriate, such as knowing you need to use a version <em>"before version X"</em>, but don't know the specific number to install. Pip can show you the available versions if you try to install an incorrect/non-existent version. For example:</p>

<pre><code>trevor@nikola:~$ pip install Django==-1
Collecting Django==-1
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Django==-1 
(from versions: 1.1.3, 1.1.4, 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4, 
... lots that I'm skipping ... 
1.6.8, 1.6.9, 1.6.10, 1.7, 1.7.1, 1.7.2, 1.7.3, 
1.7.4, 1.7.5, 1.7.6, 1.8a1, 1.8b1, 1.8b2)
  No distributions matching the version for Django==-1
</code></pre>

<p>So I know I need a pre-1.7 install, I can probably use 1.6.10.</p>
