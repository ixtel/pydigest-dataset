<html><body><div><div id="watch-description-text" class=""><p id="eow-description">I've been working on a real-time Python programming VR environment where people can write Python code and see the effects of the code they write on the world around them instantly. I am using the Unity engine and have embedded IronPython within the C# code in order to run the Python code the user writes in the environment.  You can find the GitHub repo here and try the demo if you have an Oculus Rift DK: <a href="https://github.com/rlfriedm/VR-Programming" class="yt-uix-sessionlink  " data-sessionlink="ei=K7fVVsmDDoiPYIuki5AF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rlfriedm/VR-Progra...</a>. <br/><br/>The original intention for this project was to serve as a new way of teaching basic programming concepts. This is a demo of the latest version with an example set of puzzles a user might solve while learning to program in this environment. <br/><br/>Using this environment to teach the concepts of Object-Oriented programming from the very start might prove to be beneficial as everything in VR is an object!</p></div>  </div></body></html>
