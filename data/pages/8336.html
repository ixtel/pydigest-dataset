<p>Python release tools</p>








<p>This code is licensed under the MIT license.</p>
<p>This is a suite of tools that are useful for releasing Python code for public
or private use. There are setuptools extensions to validate various conventions
and to perform release activities.</p>
<div id="installation-and-usage">
<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<p>This package is generally not installed directly but instead listed in the
<tt>setup_requires</tt> option of the setuptools <tt>setup</tt> function. For example:</p>
<pre>from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="my_clever_package",
    version="1.0.0",
    setup_requires=[
        "py_release_tools",
    ]
)
</pre>
<p>Commands are exported as distuils commands and should be automatically
available provided the package is installed. The tool provides the commands
documented below and are generally run by defining a <tt>release</tt> <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#alias-define-shortcuts-for-commonly-used-commands" rel="nofollow">alias</a>
in the project’s <tt>setup.cfg</tt> file. The author’s typical project <tt>setup.cfg</tt>
contains these aliases:</p>
<pre>[aliases]
validate = cover_tests pep8
release = validate increment_semver git_push sdist upload
release_major = validate increment_semver -M git_push sdist upload
release_minor = validate increment_semver -m git_push sdist upload
</pre>
</div>
<div id="commands">
<h2>Commands</h2>
<div id="increment-semver">
<h3>increment_semver</h3>
<p>This command will update the <tt>setup.py</tt> file version number following the
rules of <a href="http://semver.org" rel="nofollow">Semantic Versioning (semver)</a>. This command will
re-write and commit the project’s <tt>setup.py</tt> file. It assumes that the
version line is formatted as such, with some amount of leading whitespace:</p>
<pre>version="1.20.1"
</pre>
<p>It will rewrite all lines that look like this in the file.</p>
<p>The version format is:</p>
<pre>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
</pre>
<p>For more information check out the semver docs.</p>
<p>Version generation increments a version component by one. By default a patch
version is generated. Passing the <tt><span class="pre">-m</span></tt> or <tt><span class="pre">--minor</span></tt> flags to the command
will increment the minor version and set the patch version to zero. Passing
<tt><span class="pre">-M</span></tt> or <tt><span class="pre">--major</span></tt> will increment the major version and set both the minor
and patch versions to zero.</p>
<p>This command will also create a tag in the git repository of format
<tt><span class="pre">release-{semver}</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div id="git-push">
<h3>git_push</h3>
<p>This command runs a <tt>git push</tt> command to push the <tt>master</tt> branch to the
remote <tt>origin</tt>. The command will also push tags. If your git repository
doesn’t use these naming conventions the command will fail.</p>
</div>
<div id="cover-tests">
<h3>cover_tests</h3>
<p>This command will setup python
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage" rel="nofollow">coverage</a> monitoring and invoke the
setuptools <tt>test</tt> target. Coverage data will be written to <tt>.coverage</tt> in
the same directory as the <tt>setup.py</tt> file.</p>
<p>This command will also generate a Cobertura coverage report as <tt>coverage.xml</tt>
and an HTML report in the <tt>htmlcov</tt> folder.</p>
<p>Failure of the tests will cause a failure of the build so it is suitable to use
this command as a replacement for the builtin <tt>test</tt> command. This command
also suppresses the system exit that the builtin <tt>test</tt> command generates so
other commands can be chained after this one.</p>
</div>
<div id="pep8">
<h3>pep8</h3>
<p>This command will run a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow">PEP8</a>
code style validation on all Python files in the project, including the
setup.py file.</p>
