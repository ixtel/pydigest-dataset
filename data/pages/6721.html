<p>It is achievable by making one change in your models.</p>

<p>Instead of creating OneToOne relationship from <code>UserProfile</code> to <code>User</code>, subclass <code>User</code> creating <code>UserProfile</code>. Code should look like that:</p>

<pre><code>class UserProfile(User):
    # some other fields, no relation to User model

class Property(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User)
</code></pre>

<p>That will result in creating <code>UserProfile</code> model that have hidden OneToOne relation to <code>User</code> model, it won't duplicate user model.</p>

<p>After doing that change, your code will work. There are some changes under the hood, like <code>UserProfile</code> no longer have it's own ID, you can access fields from <code>User</code> inside <code>UserProfile</code> and it's hard to swap <code>User</code> model using <code>settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL</code> (that will require creating some custom function returning proper type and changing migration by hand) but if this is not a problem for you, it may be good solution.</p>
