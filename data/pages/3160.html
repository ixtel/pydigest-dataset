The goal of this song is to emulate a ride on the New York City Subway's 2 Train through three boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. At any given time, the quantity and dynamics of the song's instruments correspond to the median household income of that area. For example, as you pass through a wealthier area such as the Financial District, the instruments you hear in the song will increase in quantity, volume, and force.<br/>

In the last Forex Trading Diary Entry (#1) I described how to build an automated trading system that hooks into the OANDA forex brokerage API. I also mentioned that the next steps included constructing a portfolio and risk management overlay for all suggested signals generated by the Strategy component. In this entry of the diary I want to discuss my attempt to build a functioning Portfolio component and how far I've currently progressed.<br/>

<span><a href="http://pbpython.com/pandas-pivot-report.html" target="_blank">Generating Excel Reports from a Pandas Pivot Table</a></span> <br/>
The previous pivot table article described how to use the pandas pivot_table function to combine and present data in an easy to view manner. This concept is probably familiar to anyone that has used pivot tables in Excel. However, pandas has the capability to easily take a cross section of the data and manipulate it. This cross section capability makes a pandas pivot table really useful for generating custom reports. This article will give a short example of how to manipulate the data in a pivot table to create a custom Excel report with a subset of pivot table data.<br/>

<span><a href="https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/getting-started-with-spark-in-python" target="_blank">Getting Started with Spark (in Python)</a></span><br/>
In this post we will first discuss how to set up Spark to start easily performing analytics, either simply on your local machine or in a cluster on EC2. We then will explore Spark at an introductory level, moving towards an understanding of what Spark is and how it works (hopefully motivating further exploration). In the last two sections we will start to interact with Spark on the command line and then demo how to write a Spark application in Python and submit it to the cluster as a Spark job.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-chatapp-bluemix-app/index.html" target="_blank">Build a chat app with Pyramid, SQLDB, and Bluemix</a></span><br/>
Learn about development using the Pyramid framework and its security model, real-time communication using Socket.IO abstraction, and integration with SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy provides an easy way to integrate with database services in the Bluemix environment. By systematically adding one feature at a time, you create the Chatter chat app where users can exchange messages in real time. <br/>

PyStokes is a Cython library for computing Stokes flows produced by spheres. The core of the library is written in Cython which can be called from pure python, so that the user can choose to work in pure python and still use the library. Read more on GitHub. I will also explain some basic usage of the Cython and how we have used it to accelerate our computations.<br/>

In this practical guide, you'll learn how to use Cython to improve Python's performance--up to 3000x-- and to wrap C and C++ libraries in Python with ease. Author Kurt Smith takes you through Cython's capabilities, with sample code and in-depth practice exercises. If you're just starting with Cython, or want to go deeper, you'll learn how this language is an essential part of any performance-oriented Python programmer's arsenal.<br/>
