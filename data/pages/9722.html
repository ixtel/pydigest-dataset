<p>Yet Another LR(1) implementation</p>








<div id="yet-another-lr-implementation">
<h2>Yet Another LR Implementation</h2>
<p>This is another implementation of the classic LR(1) parsing
algorithm, along with Knuth’s LR(1) table generation algorithm.</p>
<p>Rather than follow the model of tools like yacc and require
external code generation, this library is driven dynamically
from Python code.</p>
<p>An obvious question is, “why?”</p>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>firstly, to experiment with surface syntax for expressing
grammars in Python code in as uninvasive a way as possible.</p>
<p>The package “ptk” takes a similar approach here.</p>
</li>
<li><p>secondly, to provide a playground to look at other
“cutting-edge” parsing algorithms, as a basis for improving
my own understanding of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By “cutting-edge” I’m largely referring to the late 1970s.</p>
<p>The current implementation is largely inspired by yacc,
including yacc’s various deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s a linearisation used for reduce/reduce conflict
resolution;</li>
<li>there’s a linearisation used for token precedence.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, it’s easy to get bitten by both of these - as
it is for the default shift/reduce resolution to mask
errors. A more flexible partial ordering is certainly feasible.</p>
</div>
<div id="credits">
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Some of the example grammars included in the tests are derived
from the (Red) Dragon Book, which I’ve had since I was about 16;
it’s a book which definitely shaped my life.</p>
<p>I’ve no idea how the reference numbers line up with later
additions.</p>
