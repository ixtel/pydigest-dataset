<p>Two talks for getting your projects right from the start, sponsored by <b><a href="http://intel.com">Intel</a></b> and <b><a href="http://appneta.com">AppNeta</a></b>.</p>
<p><b>Matt Bachmann, <i>Structuring Your Python Project</i></b></p>
<p>There's more to a Python project than a pile of .py files.  How should a project be organized? What files go where? How can you make the code installable with pip? What goes in setup.py?  Matt will walk through the basics of project organization and explain some of the mysteries.</p>
<p><b>Ned Batchelder, <i>Getting Started Testing</i></b></p>
<p>Testing can be overwhelming. It involves different ways of writing code, and learning new tools.  Writing tests can be a lot of work, but it definitely pays off.  This talk will explain the basics and give you direction for getting started writing tests for your own projects.</p>

<p>Pizza provided by Intel, and drinks afterward at Meadhall sponsored by AppNeta.</p> 
<p>Doors open at 6:30, talks begin at 7:00 <br/></p>
