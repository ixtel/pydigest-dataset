<p>the world is a database now you can query it with SQL</p><p>








Splicer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trivio/splicer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/trivio/splicer)</p><p>======================</p><p>``splicer`` makes the entire world look like a SQL database. </p><p>It is a python module for working with data from disparate sources </p><p>using commands to those familiar with SQL. It aims to make quick </p><p>one off queries and ETL scripts more declarative rather than procedural.</p><p>Inspired by projects like BigQuery, Postgres Foreign Data Wrappers</p><p>and Multicorn, except no database is required.</p><p>``splicer`` enables:</p><p>* Analysts to create Datasets linking various</p><p>  foreign tables together along with User Defined Functions written in python. </p><p>  Once defined, the datasets can be queried via SQL Select statements to create </p><p>  new Views of the Data.</p><p>* Extension Developers to create extensions that make various data sources</p><p>  REST endpoints, log files, NoSQL Servers, traditional Databases,</p><p>  CSV Files to behave like tables.</p><p>  ``splicer`` will take advantage of these various sources' capabilities where </p><p>  appropriate and will compensate for sources that lack basic</p><p>  features. </p><p>  For example if a database supports joins and you want to query</p><p>  two tables within that database, ``splicer`` will have that system</p><p>  perform the join for you. If however you're working with a less</p><p>  sophisticated source, like plain files, ``splicer`` will perform the</p><p>  operations for you locally.</p><p>Enough reading!
