<html><body><div><div class="post-image-description font-opensans-reg"><p>I have been working on an app with an embedded Python runtime and a built in script editor.  (Sort of like the Nuke script editor, if you work in VFX.)  I am using a read-only QTextEdit for the output.  Once I added support for doing normal output in green and errors in red, I realised that extending it to support the QTextDocument HTML subset really wouldn't be a lot of extra work, and could be kind of neat.  So if I am working on a python script to generate an HTML report or something like that, I can "print" the raw output, or "writeHTML" the rich text without having to look at it in a browser.

Some implementation details in a blog post here:  </p><a rel="noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://willrosecrans.wordpress.com/2015/05/19/python-script-editor-with-html-output">https://willrosecrans.wordpress.com/2015/05/19/python-script-editor-with-html-output</a><p>/</p></div>
