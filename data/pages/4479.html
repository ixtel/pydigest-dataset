<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>To initialize a new repo with the basic branch structure, use:</p>
<pre>git flow init [-d]
</pre>
<p>This will then interactively prompt you with some questions on which
branches you would like to use as development and production branches,
and how you would like your prefixes be named. You may simply press

suggestions.</p>
<p>The <tt><span class="pre">-d</span></tt> flag will accept all defaults.</p>

<div id="history-of-the-project">
<h2>History of the Project</h2>
<p>gitflow was originally developed by Vincent Driessen as a set of
shell-scripts. In Juni 2007 he started a Python rewrite but did not
finish it. In February 2012 Hartmut Goebel started completing the
Python rewrite and asked Vincent to pull his changes. But in June 2012
Vincent closed the pull-request and deleted his <tt><span class="pre">python-rewrite</span></tt>
branch. So Hartmut decided to release the Python rewrite on his own.</p>
<p>In year 2015 Hartmuts gitflow was abandoned and the python 3
support was missing. So Christian Assing decided to fork his version
and release it as a new python based gitflow alternative.</p>
