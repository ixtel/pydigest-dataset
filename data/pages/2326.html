<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Flask-Admin is a batteries-included, simple-to-use <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow">Flask</a> extension that lets you
add admin interfaces to Flask applications. It is inspired by the <em>django-admin</em> package, but implemented in such
a way that the developer has total control of the look, feel and functionality of the resulting application.</p>
<p>Out-of-the-box, Flask-Admin plays nicely with various ORM’s, including</p>

<p>It also boasts a simple file management interface and a <a href="http://redis.io/" rel="nofollow">redis client</a> console.</p>
<p>The biggest feature of Flask-Admin is flexibility. It aims to provide a set of simple tools that can be used for
building admin interfaces of any complexity. So, to start off with you can create a very simple application in no time,
with auto-generated CRUD-views for each of your models. But then you can go further and customize those views &amp; forms
as the need arises.</p>
<p>Flask-Admin is an active project, well-tested and production ready.</p>
