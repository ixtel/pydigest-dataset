<h1>Interview with Harry Percival</h1>
<p>If you develop and/or test web applications, especially django, you will probably enjoy this episode.</p>

<h2>Show Notes</h2>
<p>Rough outline of what we talk about:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> (first 20 minutes)</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro to Harry Percival, his background and story of how he got into TDD and ended up writing a <a href="http://amzn.to/1SqW1t3">book</a></li>
<li>Hinting of perhaps a follow up tutorial to cover some more intermediate level topics.</li>
<li>Testing django apps has some commonalities with testing flask, web2py, bottle, but djanogo does have some built in helpers. </li>
<li>Comparing using unittest and pytest with applicability to testing django projects. </li>
<li>Benefits of pytest treatment of asserts.</li>
<li>Fixtures in pytest and how they seem magical. (and a reminder that pytest supports xUnit style setup/teardown).</li>
<li>The meaning of “fixtures” as “data preparation” vs “setup/teardown”.</li>
<li>Levels of testing, the test pyramid, end to end, functional, and unit testing.</li>
<li>Some examples of very high level system testing using unittest and/or pytest.</li>
<li>Where you put your tests in a django project and apps.</li>
<li>Separating your functional testing from django app structure.</li>
<li>Functional end to end testing with selenium.</li>
<li>The django test client for middle level tests.</li>
<li>Lower level test that perhaps don’t use django test client, or avoid the database.</li>
<li>Business logic or algorithm tests might be candidates for isolated unit tests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong> (after the 20 minute mark)</p>
<ul>
<li>test isolation
<ul>
<li>testing a specific unit of code</li>
<li>perhaps only one function or method in isolation of rest of system</li>
<li>mocking or dependency injection </li>
<li>don’t have dependencies for a function</li>
<li>some logic examples where this work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>django and isolated unit tests
<ul>
<li>test isolation might not make sense for web applications</li>
<li>apps might be thin layers around a database</li>
<li>effort of isolation might not be worth it</li>
<li>django philosophy of “framework for perfectionists with deadlines”</li>
<li>view functions make a good place to test between the Internet and the models/database</li>
<li>larger projects might need testing at more levels, like around the business logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>unit tests vs integration tests
<ul>
<li>bugs are in the interactions or interfaces or bad assumptions</li>
<li>revision control, history, and continuous integration services often help detect faulty code just as much as test isolation.</li>
<li>integration tests are often the most helpful because that’s often where the difficult to find failures occur.</li>
<li>pushing dependencies into fixtures can help with test isolation as well, by having dependency failures result in an Error and not a Failure.</li>
<li>Harry recommends a talk by Gary Bernhardt, Boundaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Testing done by the development team without an external QA</li>
<li>Double loop TDD: Functional test first, then unit tests</li>
<li>Spikes: investigations without tests</li>
<li>Harry’s experience with having a freely available web version of a book that is also intended to be sold.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Update: Comment from Harry Percival on 19-Jan-2014:</strong><br/>
<em>I might have been a bit down on unit tests vs functional tests in that “unit tests never fail comment”.<br/>
Not true at all, particularly as we’ve just been thru upgrading django on our core system, and the unit tests *really* saved our bacon on that one…</em>
