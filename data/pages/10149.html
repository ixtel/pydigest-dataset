<p>A fully manual Let's Encrypt/ACME client</p>








<p>manuale is a fully manual <a href="https://letsencrypt.org" rel="nofollow">Let’s
Encrypt</a>/<a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/" rel="nofollow">ACME</a>
client for advanced users. It is intended to be used by a human in a
manual workflow and contains no automation features whatsoever.</p>
<div id="why">
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Isn’t the point of Let’s Encrypt to be automatic and seamless? Maybe,
but here’s some reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re not comfortable with an automatic process handling something
as critical, or your complex infrastructure doesn’t allow it in the
first place.</li>
<li>You already have perfect configuration management with something like
Ansible. Renewing is a matter of dropping in a new certificate. With
a manual client that works, it’s literally a minute of work.</li>
<li>You want the traditional and authentic SSL installation experience of
copying files you don’t understand to your server, searching for
configuration instructions and praying that it works.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="features">
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simple interface with no hoops to jump through. Keys and certificate
signing requests are automatically generated: no more cryptic OpenSSL
one-liners. (However, you do need to know what to do with generated
certificates and keys yourself!)</li>
<li>Support for DNS validation. No need to figure out how to serve
challenge files from a live domain. (In fact, that’s the only
validation method supported).</li>
<li>Authorization is separate from certificate issuance. Authorizations
last for months on Let’s Encrypt: there’s no need to waste time
validating the domain every time you renew the certificate.</li>
<li>Obviously, runs without root access. Use it from any machine you
want, it doesn’t care. Internet connection recommended.</li>
<li>Awful, undiscoverable name.</li>
<li>And finally, if the <tt>openssl</tt> binary is your spirit animal after
all, you can still bring your own keys and/or CSR’s. Everybody wins.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Get it from your package manager if available:</p>

<p>If not, install it from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/manuale" rel="nofollow">PyPI</a>
with <tt>pip3 install manuale</tt>.</p>
<p>Or live on the edge with the git repository:</p>
<pre>git clone https://github.com/veeti/manuale ~/.manuale
cd ~/.manuale
python3 -m venv env
env/bin/python setup.py install
ln -s env/bin/manuale ~/.bin/
</pre>
<p>Python 3.3 or above is required.</p>
</div>
<div id="quick-start">
<h2>Quick start</h2>
<p>Register an account (once):</p>
<pre>$ manuale register me@example.com
</pre>
<p>Authorize one or more domains:</p>
<pre>$ manuale authorize example.com
DNS verification required. Make sure these records are in place:
  _acme-challenge.example.com. "(some random gibberish)"
Press enter to continue.
...
1 domain(s) authorized. Let's Encrypt!
</pre>
<p>Get your certificate:</p>
<pre>$ manuale issue --output certs/ example.com
...
Certificate issued.

Expires: 2016-06-01
 SHA256: (more random gibberish)

Wrote key to certs/example.com.pem
Wrote certificate to certs/example.com.crt
Wrote certificate with intermediate to certs/example.com.chain.crt
Wrote intermediate certificate to certs/example.com.intermediate.crt
</pre>
<p>Set yourself a reminder for renewal!</p>

<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>You need to create an account once. To do so, call
<tt>manuale register [email]</tt>. This will create a new account key for
you. Follow the registration instructions.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, you’ll have your account saved in <tt>account.json</tt> in
the current directory. You’ll need this to do anything useful. Oh, and
it contains your private key, so keep it safe and secure.</p>
<p><tt>manuale</tt> expects the account file to be in your working directory by
default, so you’ll probably want to make a specific directory to do all
your certificate stuff in. Likewise, created certificates get saved in
the current path by default.</p>
<p>Next up, verify the domains you want a certificate for with
<tt>manuale authorize [domain]</tt>. This will show you the DNS records you
need to create and wait for you to do it. For example, you might do it
for <tt>example.com</tt> and <tt>www.example.com</tt>.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, you can finally get down to business. Run
<tt>manuale issue example.com www.example.com</tt> to get your certificate.
It’ll save the key, certificate and certificate with intermediate to the
working directory.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of documentation inside each command. Run <tt>manuale <span class="pre">-h</span></tt>
for a list of commands and <tt>manuale [command] <span class="pre">-h</span></tt> for details.</p>
