    making a big change. tl;dr: branch coverage is implemented differently, and
    as a result, your coverage totals are slightly different.  Try it:
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage/4.1b1">Coverage.py 4.1 beta 1</a>.
    </p><p>Because of Python 3.5's async and await keywords, the existing branch
    analysis based on bytecode was completely out of gas.  The code had long
    felt jury-rigged, and there were long-standing bugs that seemed impossible
    to solve.  The async features compiled very differently than their
    synchronous counterparts, and I didn't see a way to bring them into the
    bytecode fold.</p><p>So I ripped out the bytecode analysis and replaced it with AST (Abstract
    Syntax Tree) analysis.  I like it much better: it's based on the structure
    of the code that people see and can reason about.  Four old bugs were fixed
    as a result, along with the two or three new bugs reported on Python 3.5.</p><p>As a result though, coverage.py now calculates totals differently, because
    the full set of possible code paths is different.  So your results will
    likely shift a little bit, especially if you are using branch measurement.
    They might be higher, they might be lower.  For example, class docstrings
    now count as executable statements (because they are executable
    statements), and paths through "except" clauses probably were being
    overlooked.</p><p>Please try it out and let me know if you see anything wrong.  I won't be
    surprised if there are complex code structures that are analyzed wrong somehow.
