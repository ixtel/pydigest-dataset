<p>The next-generation for loop and work tracker</p>









<p>Just about all programs process “items” of one sort or another. That’s what
loops are for, right?</p>
<p>But with the exception of the current loop value or index, programming
languages don’t help track how processing is going. How many items have been
<em>successfully</em> processed? How many <em>errors</em> are there? How far along the
total job are we right now? Which items had problems that need to be looked
at later?</p>
<p>Even though these bookkeeping tasks are essential to just about every
program, they’re “left to the reader.” “Here are some basic loops. Have
fun!” So developers “reinvent the wheel,” tracking status with <em>ad hoc</em>
containers, counters, and status flags for every new program. Not so
high-level after all, huh?</p>
<p><tt>chores</tt> fights needless this complexity, errors, and effort by providing
a simple, repeatable pattern for processing items and tracking their status.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>from chores import Chores

chores = Chores('Jones able baker charlie 8348 Smith Brown Davis'.split())

for c in chores:
    status = 'name' if c.istitle() else 'other'
    chores.mark(c, status)

print chores.count('name'), "names,", \
      chores.count('^name'), "others"
</pre>
<p>Yields:</p>
<pre>4 names, 4 others
</pre>
<p>Or if you decide you actually want more information, change just the output
statements:</p>
<pre>print todos.count('name'),  "names:", todos.marked('name')
print todos.count('^name'), "others:", todos.marked('^name')
</pre>
<p>Now you get:</p>
<pre>4 names: ['Jones', 'Smith', 'Brown', 'Davis']
4 others: ['able', 'baker', 'charlie', '8348']
</pre>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Many programs track the status of items being processed with various lists,
dictionaries, sets, counters, and status flags. <tt>chores</tt> might not seem a
great advance at first, since it has the same kind of initialization and
looping.</p>
<p>But it gets more interesting at the end of the processing loop, where the
summary or report of what was processed, the disposition of each item worked
on, what items yielded errors or other conditions, and what special cases
were handled is produced.</p>
<p>In the examples above, we never had to keep a counter of how many names were found,
or how many non-names. When we decided we wanted to change the output from
summary counts to a full listing, we didn’t have go back and collect
different information. We just differently displayed information already at
at hand. Also note that the order of the results is nicely maintained.
When we’re reviewing reports about “what transpired,” we don’t have to work
very hard to correlate the results with the inputs; unlike when using <tt>dict</tt>
and <tt>set</tt> structures, items are reported on in the same order they arrived.</p>
<p>Typically a developer will start with only a little thought about various
dispositions for each item being processed. Over time, she’ll start to
realize: “I need to count those cases, so I can report on them!” Or, “I kept
an error counter, but I really should have been keeping a list of which
items broke, because I now have to tell the user not just how many went
wrong, but which ones in particular.” Or “I need to keep track of which ones
failed the main processing so that I can do more intensive processing on
just those special cases.” Then she’ll go back and add counters, collection
lists, and so on–adding a fair amount of <em>ad hoc</em> code that must be built,
tested, and debugged.</p>
<p>This is especially tricky for data that needs to move through multiple
stages or phases of work. The developer then has to add structures to
communicate from earlier processing steps to later ones.</p>
<p>With <tt>chores</tt>, there’s no need for such custom work. It takes over
tracking which items led to which outcomes. It’s always ready to render
quality information, either for reporting or for managing subsequent
processing. Bookkeeping information is readily available in
a tidy, logical format, with no additional development effort.</p>
<p><tt>chores</tt> especially shows its virtues as processing code becomes
more intricate and as program needs evolve over time.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I’ve successfully used <tt>chores</tt> in my own projects, and it has a
real test suite. But realistically it should be considered
“early beta” code. It’s explicitly part of experiment to up-level
development tasks, so its API and mode of use will evolve.</li>
<li><tt>chores</tt> is an example of “cross-cutting”–dealing with several
apparently disconnected concerns in a concerted way because they are,
in fact, connected, and need to be handled systematically.</li>
<li>Automated multi-version testing managed with the wonderful <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest" rel="nofollow">pytest</a> and <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox" rel="nofollow">tox</a>. Successfully packaged for, and
tested against, all late-model versions of Python: 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3,
and 3.4, as well as PyPy 2.6.0 (based on 2.7.9) and PyPy3 2.4.0 (based
on 3.2.5). Should run fine on Python 3.5, though py.test is broken on
its pre-release iterations.</li>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install or upgrade to the latest version:</p>
<pre>pip install -U chores
</pre>
<p>To <tt>easy_install</tt> under a specific Python version (3.3 in this example):</p>
<pre>python3.3 -m easy_install --upgrade chores
</pre>
<p>(You may need to prefix these with <tt>sudo</tt> command to authorize
installation. In environments without super-user privileges, you may want to
use <tt>pip</tt>’s <tt><span class="pre">--user</span></tt> option, to install only for a single user, rather
than system-wide.)</p>
