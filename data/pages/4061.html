I'll cover what it's for, how it works and describe how I used it to write a real-world networked application (a distributed hash table).<br/>We'll explore the event loop, co-routines, futures and networking with examples from my code.<br/>This won't be an exhaustive exposition. Rather, attendees will grasp enough of asyncio to continue with their own studies.<br/><br/>Slides can be found at: <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015" class="yt-uix-sessionlink  " data-sessionlink="ei=7pzVVsvjNMKEYpWogjg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2015</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides" class="yt-uix-sessionlink  " data-sessionlink="ei=7pzVVsvjNMKEYpWogjg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/PyCon/2015-slides</a>"</p></div>  </div></body></html>
