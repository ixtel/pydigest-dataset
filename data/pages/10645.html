<p>For example I read excel file into DataFrame with 2 columns(id and URL). URLs in input file are like text(without hyperlinks):</p>

<pre><code>input_f = pd.read_excel("input.xlsx")
</code></pre>

<p>Watch what inside this DataFrame - everything was successfully read, all URLs are ok in <code>input_f</code>. After that when I wan't to save this file to_excel</p>

<pre><code>input_f.to_excel("output.xlsx", index=False)
</code></pre>

<p>I got warning. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Path</strong>\worksheet.py:836: UserWarning: Ignoring URL <strong>'http:// here long URL'</strong> with
  link or location/anchor &gt; 255 characters since it exceeds Excel's
  limit for URLS   force_unicode(url))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in output.xlsx cells with long URL were empty, and URLs become hyperlinks.</p>

<p>How to fix this?</p>
