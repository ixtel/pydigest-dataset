<h2>Configuration file</h2>
<p>snaplayer lists and tells Softlayer to capture images based
on criteria information extracted from a ‘criteria file’ which is
no more than a dead-simple YAML file with a handful key-value pairs,
like so:</p>
<pre>---
# Example criteria YAML file
domain: mydomain.com
tags: [mydomain, production]
hourly: false
monthly: true
cpus: 2
</pre>
<p>Configuration options are correspondent to those of <a href="http://softlayer-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/managers/vs.html#SoftLayer.managers.vs.VSManager.list_instances" rel="nofollow">SoftLayer.vs.list_instances</a></p>

<pre>git pull upstream
</pre>
<p>2. Create a new feature branch in your local repo</p>
<pre>git checkout -b my_feature_branch
</pre>
<p>3. Make your changes, then make sure the tests passes</p>
<pre>pyvenv snaplayer-pyve &amp;&amp; source snaplayer-pyve/bin/activate
python3 setup.py test
</pre>
<p>4. Commit your changes once done</p>
<pre>git commit -a -m "My commit message"
git push origin my_feature_branch
</pre>
<ol>
<li>Submit a <a href="https://github.com/axltxl/snaplayer/compare/" rel="nofollow">pull request</a> with your feature branch containing your changes.</li>
