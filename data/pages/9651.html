<p><span><b>Blowdrycss</b></span></p> 
<p><span>Blowdrycss is an open source CSS precompiler that builds CSS based on encoded class selectors found in your web project files (currently only HTML parsing is implemented). This brand new project started in earnest during November 2015. What makes this project unique is that it only compiles the CSS you need to for your site. If a given selector is deleted from an HTML file it will automatically be removed from the generated CSS. No more bloated style files. It produces DRY CSS meaning that "font-weight: bold;" or "font-size: 1em;" will not be written hundreds of times in your CSS file. This is a work in progress, and is more about function than form at the present moment.</span> <br/></p>
