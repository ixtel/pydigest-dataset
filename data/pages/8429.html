<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Ola Sitarska</strong> on December 14, 2015 </span>

<p>We're happy to announce the winners of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">DSF</a> Board elections 2016:</p>
<p><strong>President:</strong> Frank Wiles</p>
<p><strong>Board members:</strong> Karen Tracey, Daniele Procida and James Bennett</p>
<p><strong>Secretary:</strong> Andy McKay</p>
<p><strong>Treasurer:</strong> Christophe Pettus</p>
<p>If you would like to know the full results of the elections, please get in touch with the DSF.</p>
<p>The board of the Django Software Foundation (DSF) has just met and voted unanimously to confirm Frank, Karen, Daniele, James, Andy and Christophe for their seat on the DSF board.</p>
<p>We want to thank all the other candidates again for their participation and hope to see them running at the next annual board election.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Wiles</strong> is the President and Founder of REVSYS, one of the oldest Django-focused consultancies. Before REVSYS was focused on Django, Frank was involved with the World Company where he contributed significantly to the effort that led to the creation of Django as an Open Source project. In addition to his business and technical qualifications, Frank also brings experience as an active board-member for the non-profit Headquarters Counseling Center.</p>
<p><strong>Daniele Procida</strong> was the organiser of Django Weekend 2014 (the first Django conference in the UK), and was involved in DjangoCon Europe 2014 and 2015, and PyCons in the UK and Namibia. He has been a member of the Django core team since 2013. Daniele strongly believes that diversity and inclusivity are the community's most important values, and that they deserve our full practical support. As a board member, heâ€™d  would like in particular to help to re-energise the DSF committees, and to secure long-term sustainable support for initiatives including the Django Fellowship. Daniele works at Divio AG.</p>
<p><strong>James Bennett</strong> brings to the table not just his experience as a member of the Django core team, but as a frequent speaker, writer and sometime teacher, an encourager of others, and -- nearly ten years on -- still an unabashed fan of Django and the people who use it. He believes Django has one of the most diverse and welcoming communities in the open source world, and that continuing to foster that is essential to the future of Django and of its community.</p>
<p><strong>Christophe Pettus</strong> in addition to being a technologist involved with Django since 2007, Christophe is the Chief Financial Officer for PostgreSQL Experts, Inc., with a background in corporation finance and taxation, as well as bookkeeping and comptroller skills. He also brings an experience of his involvement with cultural not-for-profit organizations in the past, as well as a long history of (successful!) interactions with the United States Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing the contributions that Frank, Daniele, James and Christophe can bring to the DSF as new members of the board.</p>
<p>The DSF would like to thank Russell Keith-Magee for his many years of service, who served as DSF President for the last 5 years. He has been the driving force behind what Django, DSF and the community is today, and we couldn't possibly be more grateful for this hard work.</p>
<p>Our thanks also go to Jannis Leidel, Stacey Haysler and Ola Sitarska who have served on the board in the past year and brought many valuable contributions during that time.</p>
