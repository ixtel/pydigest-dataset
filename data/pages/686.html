<p>Python is a general purpose, structured, high-level, open-source programming language, it was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989; it’s named after Monty Python’s Flying Circus comedy program. Python is available for all Platforms; it can run on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh &amp; all Linux distributions with ease. This makes the programs written with it cross-platform. It can also be used with frameworks like Django to create web applications just like Instagram.</p>
<p>Python is used extensively for system administration; it’s also a good alternative to teach programming to novice. It’s used by Google in many components of its Web Crawler and Search Engine; Yahoo also uses it for managing its discussion groups. NASA has also used Python for its software systems and it was adopted as the standard scripting language for its Integrated Planning System.</p>
<p>This post is a road map for anyone willing to Python from scratch, the post will present and compare between the best free online sources where beginners can start from and follow along, the sources stated here are for full structured courses so you won’t find a link to a single video or unrelated tutorials.</p>

<h2>Udemy</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?q=python&amp;view=grid&amp;price=free" target="_blank">Udemy</a> is the seventh online outlet where beginners can start learning Python for free; you can learn literally anything on Udemy for free or for free (depending on the course provider). To join Udemy just register using your email. Go to the search bar and type what you want to learn (Python in our case), of course you should choose the free courses and at the time of writing this post the following courses were present:</p>
<p><a href="http://howtolearn.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/73-1024x442.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-975" src="http://howtolearn.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/73-1024x442.jpg" alt="Udemy Python Course, learn Python online, learn Python free, how learn Python, Python tutorials"/></a></p>
<p>You can choose one of these courses and start it. Each course is divided into lessons (depending on the instructor). Of course if you want to proceed with more levels in Python for instance you’ll have to pay or just search for another course that’s free, but after all it’ll be inconvenient as there would be no consistency in your learning curve. The following are the pros and cons of Udemy.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Free.</li>
<li>The courses are well-organized.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You’ll have to pay per course to proceed with your learning journey.</li>
<li>It’s a trial and error process for both the free and paid courses as it depends on the instructor (stars aren’t that convenient as the instructor might be new that’s why he/she has no stars).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: It’s a trial and error experience; so it’s better to try other free outlet from the sources stated in this post.</p>
