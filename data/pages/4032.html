Something that happened today made me think of writing a </p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29">quine</a><p>, in Python.
</p><p>
A four </p><i>line</i><p> Python </p><i>quine</i><p>;</p><p>
how's that for a </p><i>rhyme</i><p>?</p><p>
# Not so good.
</p><p>
A four line Python quine;</p><p>
Yes, this one is mine.</p><p>
# Ah, better.
</p><p>
A four line Python quine;</p><p>
Sure, this too is mine.</p><p>
# So-so.
</p><p>
A four line Python quine;</p><p>
Can you stretch that to nine?</p><p>
# It may not be worth my time.
</p><p>
A four line Python quine;</p><p>
Hello, sir, rise and shine!
</p><p>
Of course, since the quine prints itself (by </p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29">definition</a><p>) when run, I don't need to show the code separately from the output:
</p><pre>$ python quine.py
import sys
with open(sys.argv[0]) as program:
    for line in program:
        sys.stdout.write(line)
</pre><p>Let's check that it works right:
</p><pre>$ python quine.py &gt; pq.py
$ fc /l quine.py pq.py
Comparing files quine.py and PQ.PY
FC: no differences encountered
</pre><p>The quine could be shortened to:
</p><pre>import sys
with open(sys.argv[0]) as p:
    for l in p:
        sys.stdout.write(l)
</pre><p>I'm sure someone can come up with a shorter quine; is it thine? but this was my first time writing one, and I had fun :)
</p><p>
- Enjoy.
