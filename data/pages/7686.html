<p>PyBloom: A Probabilistic data structure.</p>








<p>pybloom is a Python implementation of the bloom filter probabilistic data
structure. The module also provides a Scalable Bloom Filter that allows a
bloom filter to grow without knowing the original set size.</p>
<p>PS:
This is a mirror package, since the original author seems to be busy and
didn’t upload the v2.0 to pypi.</p>
<p>All copyright goes to original author.</p>
