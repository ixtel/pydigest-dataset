<p>Nexedi is proud to announce the availability of release 5.5 of the ERP5 Open Source ERP. In 1.888 commits since release 5.4.7. , many ERP5 applications saw significant improvements (Accounting, CRM, DMS, e-Commerce, HR, Payroll, Trade, Web, Blog and Forum among others).</p>
<p>Release 5.5  most notably pushes ERP5's capabilities for 24/7 operation on clusters even further: ERP5 already supports since 10 years the development of business logic, forms and workflows online on live instances and the transparent distribution of changes on all cluster nodes thanks to the use of the ZEO distributed object architecture. With the introduction of ZODB Components, ERP5 Release 5.5 extends these capabilities to the core of ERP5: object schema definitions (property sheets), unit tests, functional tests and extension methods are now managed as distributed objects. This technology enables mainframe-like non-disruptive operation of ERP5's enterprise applications on standard hardware.</p>
<p>With the introduction of code mirror and ace editor for web development, ERP5 becomes even more attractive for developers who would like to set-up ERP5 as a privately owned Open Source PaaS for business applications.</p>
<p>Finally, Release 5.5 is the first release offering Chinese and German Internationalisation (Translation and Accounting Integration) through ERP5 Configurator.</p>
