                <p>At least once a week, someone is in the Python IRC channel on  Freenode asking a very specific question: How can they use Python to make an  app for their Android or iOS phone?</p>
<p>
  For a long time, the answer was “You don’t.” In order to write an  app for Android or iOS, you had to learn either Java or Objective-C, or you had  to use a third-party application that relied on a GUI, HTML, and Javascript to  create applications. Python doesn’t run natively on any of the major mobile  platforms, so there was no uploading a .py file and simply running it. A few  libraries covered Android, but left out iOS.</p>
<p>
  Python still isn’t included with any of the platforms, but a  library has come along that has made it possible to use Python to create  applications that run on iOS, Android, and even on desktops (Linux, Windows,  and OSX). That library is Kivy.</p>
<h2>
  What is Kivy? </h2>
<p>Kivy is a library that allows you to use Python to create  applications for mobile devices and desktops. It takes your code and creates  applications from your logic. Then, with each app and APK, it includes a nearly  complete installation of Python.</p>
<h3>Write Once, Deploy to Many</h3>
<p>
  The biggest feature of Kivy is the ability to write code once and  deploy that code to many platforms. Everyone with a smartphone has felt the  pain of seeing an awesome app come out for one line of phones, but never materialize  for their particular phone. </p>
<p>
  Even more common is when a useful app comes out, but there’s no  desktop equivalent. Not everyone has access to a smartphone, or wants a certain  app with them all the time. There are quite a few games I wish existed on my  computer, where I could have keyboard and mouse control, as well as some  productivity apps, like task managers or certain alarm tools.</p>
<p>
  With Kivy, you don’t need a developer for each platform. One  developer can create for all of them, and then push a separately packaged  application to each app store.</p>
<h3>Key Kivy Features</h3>
<p>
  Kivy goes beyond a framework for creating simple apps for your  phone or desktop. It can interface with the phone’s hardware and do advanced  rendering. It has access to rendering engines. It can do so much more than a  simple web app could do.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Camera:</strong> There are built in adapters for smartphone cameras.  This is one of the first requirements that will have me jumping over to  creating a native app, rather than creating a responsive website. Though there  are, in theory, some HTML5 inputs for cameras, the coverage for this in  browsers is spotty at best. </li>
<li><strong>Video:</strong> Kivy includes modules for reading and playing videos.  True, this can be done through a web app, but the experience can sometimes be shaky.  Older phones might try to play the video without taking up the whole screen, or  the memory usage might be higher than it should be.</li>
<li><strong>Multitouch and gestures: </strong>Kivy has a robust module for input,  allowing for multitouch and gestures. </li>
<li><strong> Visual effects and OpenGL: </strong>Because Kivy has access to OpenGL,  it can perform a large array of visual effects and do quite a bit of rendering.  Kivy also uses PyGame, so creating games becomes much easier (though you do  have to rewrite existing PyGame code for Kivy). PyGame comes with modules for  drawing shapes, rendering, dealing with colors, and playing music (as well as  blowing things up, naturally).</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous network requests: </strong>One important feature of any  native app, at least for people like me who travel in and out of network areas,  is the ability to finish requests when a network is available. I like being  able to work on my phone while in a tunnel, then have it sync my work to the  cloud when I hit a station. </li>
<li><strong>UI features:</strong> Kivy comes with a number of widgets and controls  that are beautifully designed. This can be a real benefit to your project if  you’re trying to prototype quickly, and don’t yet have access to a designer.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Example program</h3>
<p>
  It doesn’t take very many lines of code to create a Kivy program.  Here’s a sample ‘Hello, World’ application from the documentation:</p>
<pre>import kivy
kivy.require('1.0.6') # replace with your current kivy version !

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.button import Button

class MyApp(App):
    def build(self):
        return Button(text='Hello World')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyApp().run()</pre>

<h2>
  What You Need to Know to Successfully  Develop Kivy Apps </h2>
<p>You should have a pretty solid grasp on Python. Learning Python  while trying to learn Kivy might end up confusing the beginner. You don’t need  to be an expert Python programmer, but you should be comfortable delving into  docs and using APIs.</p>
<p>
  You should also be familiar with MVC patterns. You can write a Kivy  program without them, but it might drive you slowly mad as the program grows. </p>
<p>
  Finally, while you don’t need to know how to program on Android or  iOS, you should know some of the high-level concepts, like what devices are  common with each OS, and how to run emulators. A run through a high-level  tutorial should be enough to get you comfortable with what’s to come. You  should also take some time to get comfortable with some of the APIs that Kivy  doesn’t cover, like GPS or notifications.</p>
<p>
  If you already program on Android or iOS, a bit of a perspective  shift might be needed. Kivy creates single-window apps. There are ways to  simulate multiple windows, but this can be confusing to some when they first  move over.</p>
<h2>
  Layout in Kivy </h2>
<p>Kivy comes with a special language for defining layout. This allows  you to keep your logic and presentation separate. Kv (the layout language)  isn’t complex, but you should review the documentation briefly before diving  in.</p>
<p>
  A Kv file looks something like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;ClassName&gt;:    
    LayoutType:
        WidgetType:
            pos: self.center_x - 5, 0
            size: 10, self.height
            
    LayoutType2:
        font_size: 70  
        center_x: root.width / 4
        top: root.top - 50
        text: "0"
</pre>
<p>
  So WidgetType is within LayoutType, and LayoutType2 is right after  LayoutType. These are all stored in a view called ViewName, which can be reused  throughout the application by different views. As for the values to the left of  the colon, those are Python statements. They might be as simple as a single  value, or they might be a calculation of some kind.</p>
<p>
  There are a number of layouts and widgets available out of the box:</p>
<ul>
  <li>    Accordion: Expands or collapses  items through touch or clicks</li>
  <li>    ActionBar and ActionItems:  Collects items you might want to give the user quick access to.</li>
  <li>    BoxLayout: Arranges  children in a box, horizontally or vertically.</li>
  <li>    Bubble: Brings up a  bubble with possible actions or information (like what is at a location, or  giving the option to copy or paste information)</li>
  <li>    Button: Just what it  sounds like! A button!</li>
  <li>    Carousel: Allows the  user to swipe between slides</li>
  <li>    <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.html">And  many more!</a></li>
  </ul>
<h2>
  Examples in the Wild </h2>
<p>Same code is all well and good, but where is Kivy being used in  production, by actual companies?</p>
<p>
  Bargenius is an app made for single-use tablets, specializing in  what foods pair with what drinks. Rather than give a visitor a paper menu, they  can be given a tablet that offers additional details about the food being  offered, and suggest what drinks might go with their selection.</p>
<p>
  Particle Panda HD is useful for exploring what Kivy can do with its  graphics libraries. With it, the user can create particle effects that can then  be exported, so they can be used in other applications. This application is  completely free, so make sure to check it out if you’re interested in rendering  graphics or high-end effects.</p>
<p>
  ProcessCraft is a business application geared towards individuals  who need to model complex business data, but don’t want to train staff to use  complex notation.</p>
<p>
  Finally, you can look at the source code of three games written in  Kivy and submitted for a 2012 contest: Deflectouch uses Kivy’s multitouch  capabilities, FishLife explores industrial waste and its impact on sea life,  and memoryKivy is a simple memory game.</p>

<h2>
  Do I Have to Pay Them? </h2>
<p>You do not! Kivy is open source (MIT licensed), and does not  require any payment, even if you end up making an app that generates money  through sales or ads. They don’t even require a link to their module, and you  can feel free to fork them on GitHub.</p>
<p>
  Just because you don’t have to pay Kivy  doesn’t mean a piper doesn’t need to be paid. Developer licenses still need to  be purchased for each market where you want to publish your app. Here are the  current rates as of November 2013:</p>
<ul>
  <li> iOS/OSX: $99 a year (unlimited apps)</li>
  <li> Android (Play): $25 lifetime (unlimited apps)</li>
  <li> Android (Amazon): Free (unlimited apps)</li>
  <li> Windows store: $19 a year (unlimited apps)You should also note  that, just because you made an app doesn’t mean it will get accepted. For each  store, apps are reviewed (though some of the stores are more thorough than  others), and rejection is always a possibility. </li>
  </ul>
<h2>
Where You Can Learn More </h2>
<p>Obviously, the best place to start is kivy.org! There, they have  documentation, example projects, and tutorials. </p>
<p>
  Ben Rousch did an excellent tutorial at PyOhio, showing off what  Kivy can do as well as building an app live. You can watch that video on <a href="http://www.PyVideo.org">PyVideo.org</a>.  If you’re not interested in the demos, go ahead and skip to 14:00. I was next  door, and I can attest to the fact that it was standing room only, and one of  the most talked about tutorials of the conference.  </p>
<p>
  On Android, I recommend installing the Kivy Showcase app. It will  give you an idea what Kivy is capable of, and provides a handy reference for UI  elements. Showcase is also available for the desktop by downloading the Kivy  source and looking in the examples folder.</p>
<p>
  Kivy.org also hosts a feed of all of recent blog posts about Kivy  at <a href="http://kivy.org/planet/">http://kivy.org/planet/</a>. If you’d rather talk to some of the  developers and users, you may want to check out their IRC channel, #kivy, on  Freenode.</p>
<p>
  I hope that if you do decide to make an app with Kivy, you drop by  to show it off! Kivy is building a friendly and eager community around its  framework, and we would love to see what you do with it!</p>
