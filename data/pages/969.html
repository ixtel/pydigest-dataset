<h2>Django 1.7 release candidate 1</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>James Bennett</strong> on June 26, 2014 </span>

<p>It's almost here!</p>
<p>Tonight we're pleased to announce the first release-candidate package for Django 1.7. This release has been quite a while in the making, and includes several major new features. There's a new built-in schema-migration framework, improved tools for validating and checking your projects, a complete refactor of the way Django identifies and loads your applications, and support for custom database lookups.</p>
<p>And that's just the biggest highlights; for a full rundown of features, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.7/">the in-development 1.7 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>As with all pre-release packages, this is <strong>not</strong> for production use. But if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find and fix bugs (which should be reported to <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue tracker</a>), you can grab a copy of the release-candidate package from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a>. And as always, signed MD5 and SHA1 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.7c1.checksum.txt">checksums</a> of the 1.7 release-candidate package are available.</p>
