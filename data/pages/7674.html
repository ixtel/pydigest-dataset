<html><body><div><pre class="textmate-source"><pre class="sunburst"><span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">It has been reported that echel0n is spreading false rumors about the change of organizations from SiCKRAGETV to SickRage at <span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">https://github.com/SickRage/SickRage</span>
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">Echelon came back after 14 months or so and destroyed the entire team and said basically he did not need us and he could do this all on his own, saying it was his.
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">The excuse he gave was because of a bug in the develop branch (which everyone knows is for development and testing)
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">In reality it was because for multiple reasons. We had previously refused to allow him to sit back and control all donations (keeping them all for himself) and stuck with a "let the user decide who they want to donate to".
Also, he made the comment about "his software" which I promptly reminded him that it was not "his" and it was open source and belonged to the community, even our users. This resulted in him removing me from the organization and banning me from the channel. Many users and team members tried to reason with echelon, whose resolve only got worse as time went on. While the goal was to come to terms and stay in the same organization and work together, he made sure that was not a possibility with every chance he had, while we continued to hope that to be the solution.
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">He then decided it was a good idea to remove all members from the organization.
He feels he owns SickRage and all of the work anyone has ever done on it.
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">He has caused this same type of problem in the past for similar reasons, which resulted in SickGear.
In the end, it was decided to move to a new organization, taking the name with us and the entire team.
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">So no, the new organization is NOT fake, or a scam. echelon was just fired as the organization owner, to prevent the possibility that he will ever disrupt the project in such a way again.
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">He also removed the issue tracker, we have ours still accepting issue reports here: <span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">https://github.com/SickRage/sickrage-issues/issues</span>
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">You have no worries of this "malicious code" he just recently mentioned in his channel either, SickRage is open source, and rest assured that if there were any malicious code the world would immediately see it.
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">Do not follow crazy people, that is just crazy.
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">As you can see from the screenshots, the entire team has moved, except the virus that is echelon:
<span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">http://tinypic.com/r/n5q70k/9</span>
<span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">http://tinypic.com/r/2w71ws6/9</span>
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">Our repo has many fixes (400 or so commits over top of his org, and is totally active - even more now that we have moved)
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">Instructions for moving to the new organization:
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">first back up your database and config (to be sure, there is no risk in changing over whatsoever)
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">command line:
git remote set-url origin <span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">https://github.com/SickRage/SickRage.git</span>
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">Otherwise you could re-clone from <span class="markup markup_underline markup_underline_link markup_underline_link_text">https://github.com/SickRage/SickRage.git</span>
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">Installers and guides and supporting applications will soon be updated with the new organization (yes, outside contributors also support this change)
</span>
<span class="meta meta_paragraph meta_paragraph_text">Also, we have a temporary channel set up on freenode for questions, chat and support: #sickrage-issues</span>
