    <p>Meet <a class="reference external" href="http://wharfee.com">wharfee</a> - previously named dockercli. It is a shell for Docker that can
do autocompletion and syntax highlighting, as well as some useful shortcuts.</p>
<p>I had to rename my tool to avoid stepping on any official trademarks and to
comply with a legal <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/j-bennet/wharfee/issues/89">request</a>. Wharfie, according to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevedore">wikipedia</a>, is a synonym
for someone who works in the docks. And I thought it's a cute word...
very important!</p>
