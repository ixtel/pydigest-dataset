Pydna simplifies both the planning and sharing of cloning strategies and is especially useful for complex or combinatorial DNA molecule construction. An important difference compared to existing tools with similar goals is the use of Python instead of a specifically constructed language, providing a simulation environment that is more flexible and extensible by the user.<br/>

With this book, you will learn about all the tools you need to successfully perform research studies and modeling, improve your trading strategies, and effectively manage risks. You will explore the various tools and techniques used in solving complex problems commonly faced in finance. You will learn how to price financial instruments such as stocks, options, interest rate derivatives, and futures using computational methods. Also, you will learn how you can perform data analytics on market indexes and use NoSQL to store tick data.<br/>

This book starts with a look at the test-driven development process, and how it is different from the traditional way of writing code. All the concepts are presented in the context of a real application that is developed in a step-by-step manner over the course of the book. While exploring the common types of smelly code, we will go back into our example project and clean up the smells that we find. Additionally, we will use mocking to implement the parts of our example project that depend on other systems. Towards the end of the book, we'll take a look at the most common patterns and anti-patterns associated with test-driven development, including integration of test results into the development process.<br/>

<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/heynemann/cyclops" target="_blank">Cyclops</a></span><br/>
Cyclops is a router of sentry error reporting requests. It receives error reports, keeps them in-memory (or any other storage you implement) and sends to your sentry backend in regular intervals. It takes into account the time your sentry backend is taking to service each request when calculating the interval with which to send the next request, thus making sure you don't flood your sentry backend. In preliminary load testing, a server with 23 instances of Cyclops running handled more than 12 thousand requests per second.<br/>
