<p>SQLAlchemy release 1.0.5 is now available.</p>
<p>Release 1.0.5 is mostly a bugfix release, in particular repairing
some issues with MutableType as well as improving support for Postgresql
under Pypy.</p>
<p>It also has an improvement to the SQL Server dialect which
removes an old legacy system of attempting to rewrite SQL statements that
include a schema qualifier; the system remains in place by default for the 1.0
series, however can be disabled using a new <tt class="docutils literal">create_engine()</tt> flag.
As the flag will most likely be reversed in the 1.1 series,
a warning is emitted when schema-qualified tables are
used without a true/false setting for this flag.  SQL Server applications
that use remote schemas will want to begin experimenting with disabling
this behavior in preparation for it being disabled by default.</p>
