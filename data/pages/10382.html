<p>As your greenlet is never actually "blocking", but consuming CPU forever, it's never killed. From gevent's point of view, it's going to be killed, but this will never happen because the greenlet will never leave its while-loop.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that if you add <code>sleep(0)</code> in your while loop, <code>sleep</code> will raise GreenletExit and the loop will break.</p>

<p>In fact, you can deduce this by looking at your code :</p>

<pre><code>try:
    while True:
        pass
except ...:
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>There is syntaxically nothing that can raise an exception here. We need to do something that can raise, and that's <code>sleep(0)</code>.</p>
