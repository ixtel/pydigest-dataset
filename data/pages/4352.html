Mahmoud Hashemi is lead developer of the Python Infrastructure team at eBay/PayPal and he has some amazing facts and studies to discuss about the truths and myths using Python for real projects. We discuss how eBay is using Python internally for many large-scale uses. Then we move on to discuss the 10 myths of enterprise Python, such as Python is not compiled, Python is weakly-typed, Python does not scale, and more. <br/>

In this episode we speak with Mike Bayer. Mike created SQLAlchemy in 2005 and over the past 10 years has been building and refining this amazing RDBMS ORM and data access layer.  You'll learn a lot about the history of the project and how it has evolved over time. You'll also here where Mike got some of his inspiration for the design patterns used in the library. <br/>

<span><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/colour-science/colour-website/blob/master/ipython/red_colourspaces_derivation.ipynb" target="_blank">RED Colourspaces Derivation</a></span><br/>
The purpose of this document is to illustrate the steps we followed to compute RED colourspaces primaries. The most important attribute used to specify an RGB colourspace is the set of 3 chromaticities or primaries encompassing the gamut of colours that the RGB colourspace can represent. A convenient way to view an RGB colourspace gamut is to project it onto a chromaticity diagram such as the CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram where the primaries define the triangle encompassing the gamut.<br/>

The purpose of this project is to investigate topic modeling in multi-aspect reviews. More specifically, I wanted to investigate a way to find the words in reviews which were associated with the different categories being rated. Since I, like seemingly all data sciencists, love beer, I was thrilled to find a dataset containing about 1.5 million beer reviews from the beeradvocate website. Here is a summary of my workflow and findings in playing around with this dataset.<br/>

Data science libraries, frameworks, modules, and toolkits are great for doing data science, but they're also a good way to dive into the discipline without actually understanding data science. In this book, you'll learn how many of the most fundamental data science tools and algorithms work by implementing them from scratch. If you have an aptitude for mathematics and some programming skills, author Joel Grus will help you get comfortable with the math and statistics at the core of data science, and with hacking skills you need to get started as a data scientist. Today's messy glut of data holds answers to questions no one's even thought to ask. This book provides you with the know-how to dig those answers out.<br/>
