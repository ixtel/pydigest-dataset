<p>Hello, Py people! 
</p>
<p>As you may know, we've recently made coolish <a href="http://www.checkio.org/blog/python-games/">infographics</a>  on how Python is used in AAA game development and received an awesome feedback.</p>

<p>Today we decided to continue series of Python based software overview, this time we will concentrate on Web Services and PC Programs built using Python.</p>

<p>You'll be really surprised which services are using Python, lets start with the most famous one: Reddit</p>
<p>• <b>Reddit</b> is an entertainment, social networking and news website where members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links. Reddit user base reached 174 million of registered users. Members can then vote submissions "up" or "down" to organize the posts and determine their position on the site's pages. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits". Reddit is entirely built in Python, it's even partially Open Sourced, you can find it's sources in it's <a href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit">GitHub repository</a> </p>
<p>Quora is our next contender, it's one of the biggest question-and-answer websites after CheckiO forum</p>
<p>• <b>Quora</b> is a question-and-answer website where questions are created, answered, edited and organized by its community of users. Users can collaborate by editing questions and suggesting edits to other users' answers.
It's entirely built with Python And Tornado web framework, in case you're interested in detailed reasons why developer team chosen Python as main language, feel free to click <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Quora-choose-Python-for-its-development"> this link</a></p>
<p>We bet you heard about 3D Max, but you might not know what is Blender 3D!</p>
<p>• <b>Blender</b> is a professional free and open-source 3D computer graphics software product used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and video games. Alongside the modeling features it also has an integrated game engine. It's written C, C++ but heavily uses Python for tool creation and prototyping, game logic, importing and/or exporting from other formats, task automation and custom tools.</p>
<p>File-transfer is what we're doing almost every day on the internet, and peer to peer transfers are one of the fastest ways of sending and receiving files. Yes, we're talking about BitTorrent protocol, and BitTorrent client specifically, as it was the first and the most famous P2P client.</p>

<p>• <b>BitTorrent</b> is a peer-to-peer program developed by Bram Cohen and BitTorrent, Inc. used for uploading and downloading files via the BitTorrent protocol. BitTorrent was the first client written for the protocol. 
Until 5.3 and earlier client version, it was fully written in Python, which at that time made it one of the most used Python software in the world.</p>
<p>Of course we all know and use Instagram, but did you know that it uses Python for many of it's needs?</p>
<p>• <b>Instagram</b>  is an online mobile photo-sharing, video-sharing and social networking service that enables its users to take pictures and videos, and share them on a variety of social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Flickr. A distinctive feature is that it confines photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid images, in contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras. Users can also apply digital filters to their images. The maximum duration for Instagram videos is 15 seconds. Python is a big helper in whole Instagram service, Task Queue &amp; Push Notifications, Monitoring and Error reporting are all done with Python and it's frameworks.</p>
