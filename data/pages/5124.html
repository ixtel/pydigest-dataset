                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEVELOPERS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;All submissions are online. You can code in DoSelect cloud IDE without any setup. If you are willing to code on your local machine, make sure you upload the code and submit the solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The developer can use any language, but use of Python, Ruby, Scala or Node will get extra points. Candidates can use framework like Django or Flask or Rails for these applications. Database can be any SQL or NoSQL DB. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OVERVIEW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;The challenges  are supposed to be ideas around which the developer can build creative applications. Creative deviation from the challenges below is allowed, as long as it adds to the core concept (mentioned in the problem statement).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developers will be tested on code architecture, completion, organization, and functionality of their code. Creativity on proper usability will also be evaluated in a positive light.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABOUT KNOWLARITY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowlarity &lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt;solves business problems by making telephony intelligent and reliable in real time over cloud for start-ups, SMEs and Enterprises.
