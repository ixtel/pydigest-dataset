<span><a href="http://pgbovine.net/cpython-internals.htm" target="_blank">CPython internals: A ten-hour codewalk through the Python interpreter source code</a></span><br/>
Here are nine lectures walking through the internals of CPython. The purpose of these lectures is to give a technical overview of the core components of CPython. Although it does not strive to be comprehensive, once you understand these lectures, you should be able to understand the rest of the CPython code base.<br/>

<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZWuPVWq7p4" target="_blank">Data science in Python: pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn</a></span><br/>
In this video, we'll cover the data science pipeline from data ingestion (with pandas) to data visualization (with seaborn) to machine learning (with scikit-learn). We'll learn how to train and interpret a linear regression model, and then compare three possible evaluation metrics for regression problems. Finally, we'll apply the train/test split procedure to decide which features to include in our model.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.galvanize.com/blog/2015/05/28/classifying-and-visualizing-musical-pitch-with-k-means-clustering/" target="_blank">Classifying and Visualizing Musical Pitch with K-means Clustering</a></span><br/>
The Galvanize data science curriculum includes a collection of machine learning topics popular among data scientists in the tech industry, but the skills students learn at Galvanize are not limited to only the most popular tech industry applications. For example, audio signal and musical analysis is a less frequently discussed but interesting application of the machine learning concepts taught in Galvanize's Data Science Intensive. Using topics from Galvanize's curriculum, this tutorial will demonstrate how to classify and visualize musical pitches from recordings using k-means clustering, implemented with NumPy/SciPy, Scikit-learn, and Plotly.<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Automation-of-Locking-systems-and-Intrusion-Detect/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank">Automation of Locking systems and Intrusion Detection In Homes</a></span><br/>
This post shows you how to create a real time application, with the least amount of delay and maximum precision to improve the security systems in our homes and, increase accessibility to the users. It is a highly robust web tool compared to existing GSM based tools, which gives us real time notifications. What makes our tool robust is its ability to continuously update the sensor data such as the room temperature to the webpage.<br/>

From the beginning, this book will cover how to set up your Raspberry Pi for computer vision applications, exploring the basics of OpenCV, and how to design and implement real-life computer vision applications on your own. By sequentially working through the steps in each chapter, you will quickly be able to master the features of OpenCV. In the end of the book, you will also be introduced to SimpleCV, which is another powerful computer vision library for Python. Featuring plenty of coding examples and exercises, this book offers you an unparalleled learning experience.<br/>

This month, we have special guest speaker Jeffrey Spies, co-founder and CTO of Center for Open Science. He will talk to us about How Python Web Developers Will Save Science. The goal of the talk is to convince us how easy it is to change science for the better if you know any Python. Current incentives in the sciences have led to inefficiency, inaccuracy, and exclusivity. He will show how Python web developers are well-positioned to do something about it. Examples will illustrate that the title of this talk is not hyperbole.<br/>
