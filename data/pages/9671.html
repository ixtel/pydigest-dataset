    for installing and upgrading <a class="offsite" rel="external" href="http://open.edx.org">Open edX</a>.  I
    want to know how it is being used, for example, how many people in the last
    month used certain versions or switches.</p><p>To collect information like that, I can put together a URL in the program,
    and ping that URL.  What's a good simple way to collect that information?
    What server or service is easy to use and can help me look at the data? Is
    this something I should use classic marketing web analytics for? Is there a
    more developer-centric service out there?</p><p>This is one of those things that seems easy enough to just do with bit.ly,
    or a dead-stupid web server with access logs, but I'm guessing there are
    better ways I don't yet know about.</p></div></div></body></html>
