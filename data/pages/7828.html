<p>I am reading a JSON file and dynamically creating a graph using pygraphviz, using a simple loop:</p>

<pre><code>hostdata = []
nodes = []
edges = {}
current_host = ""
trial = pgv.AGraph(strict=False, overlap=False)
for filename in os.listdir(options.directory):
    with open(options.directory + "/" + filename, "r") as myfile:
        hostdata = Truth(myfile.read().replace('\n', ''))
    nodes.append(hostdata.host["something"])
    current_something = hostdata.host["something"]
    for key, value in hostdata.peer.iteritems():
        nodes.append(key)
        edges[current_something] = key
        trial.add_edge(current_host, key)
</code></pre>

<p>The graph is complicated, but I really would prefer if the edges don't cross the nodes.  I tried, when I set the strict and overlap, but I still have lines crossing over nodes.</p>

<p>This seems like something people would run into a lot, but I can't find anything on it.  I am probably doing something completely wrong, or using the wrong search term.  Any help appreciated.</p>
