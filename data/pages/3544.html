<span><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0487/" target="_blank">PEP 487 - Simpler customisation of class creation</a></span><br/>
Currently, customising class creation requires the use of a custom metaclass. This custom metaclass then persists for the entire lifecycle of the class, creating the potential for spurious metaclass conflicts. This PEP proposes to instead support a wide range of customisation scenarios through a new namespace parameter in the class header, and a new __init_subclass__ hook in the class body.The new mechanism should be easier to understand and use than implementing a custom metaclass, and thus should provide a gentler introduction to the full power Python's metaclass machinery.<br/>

This is a really big release. Over 150 contributors, and almost 6000 commits in a bit under a year. Support for languages other than Python is greatly improved, notebook UI has been significantly redesigned, and a lot of improvement has happened in the experimental interactive widgets. The message protocol and document format have both been updated, while maintaining better compatibility with previous versions than prior updates. The notebook webapp now enables editing of any text file, and even a web-based terminal (on Unix platforms).<br/>
