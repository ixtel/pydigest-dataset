<p>I do apologize for the my long absence from PyScripter development and support.  However I am back with a new release that <b>supports Python 3.4</b>. </p><p>Unfortunately, Google has made the the Project Hosting Downloads read-only and will eventually be terminating Project Hosting  services.  I have moved the project downloads to Sourceforge <a href="http://goog_188807326/">(</a><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscripter/</a>) where you can find PyScripter v.2.6.   Later I will be moving the source code and the issue tracker to GitHub.</p>
