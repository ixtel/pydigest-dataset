						<p>We are now approaching the final steps towards the PyCharm 4.5 release which by all means is going to be a milestone for our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">Python and Web development IDE</a>. So today we’re happy to announce the availability of the <strong>PyCharm 4.5 Release Candidate</strong>.</p>
<p>Please take it for a spin and give us your <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY">feedback</a>. The PyCharm 4.5 RC build 141.1075 is available for <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+(EAP)">download</a> from the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+(EAP)">Early Access Preview page</a>.</p>
<p>PyCharm 4 Release Candidate includes mostly a consolidation of bug fixes as compared to previous EAP builds. For the detailed list of notable changes and improvements in this build, please check the <a href="https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/PyCharm+141.1075+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a few new features are introduced in the PyCharm 4.5 RC. First, a couple of new refactorings appeared. With <strong>“Convert to Python Package”</strong> and <strong>“Convert to Python Module”</strong> new refactorings you can easily convert a python module to a package and vice versa:</p>

<p>Second, the <strong>Python Profile Integration</strong> which was introduced in the <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/05/pycharm-4-5-eap-build-141-988-introducing-python-profiler/">previous EAP build</a> now works with remote interpreters the same way it does with the local ones. You can easily collect profiler statistics and browse through it with the graph representation:</p>

<p>And last but not least, in the project structure you can now mark a directory as <strong>Resource Root</strong> for static content such as CSS or JavaScript files, making Django templates, for example, understand the file paths as they should:</p>

<p>In case you missed what’s new in upcoming PyCharm 4.5 – please read the blog posts covering new features in the <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/04/announcing-the-pycharm-4-5-eap-opening/">first</a>, <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/04/announcing-the-pycharm-4-5-eap-build-141-832/">second</a>, and <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/05/pycharm-4-5-eap-build-141-988-introducing-python-profiler/">third</a> EAP builds.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/JetBrains+PyCharm+Preview+%28EAP%29">download the build</a> or upgrade from within the IDE (from previous PyCharm 4.5 EAP builds only) without a full re-installation using the patch-based upgrade. Just make sure you’ve selected the EAP or Beta Releases channel in the update settings.</p>
<p>We hope that there will be no major bugs, however, should you encounter any problems, please report them to <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY">YouTrack</a> – we’ll still have a bit of time to fix stuff before the final release.</p>
