Random number generators are used everyday to encrypt data and communications but if the random number generators are flawed then they stop being cryptographically secure and hackers can exploit those vulnerabilities to decrypt the encrypted data and communications. For this reason random number generators need to pass robust sets of statistical tests for randomness, such as the NIST suite of cryptographic tests for randomness, to determine whether they are sufficient for cryptographic uses. In this post we are going to subject various financial market returns to the NIST suite of tests and see whether or not we should be able to, in theory, hack the market.<br/>

<span><a href="http://blaze.github.io/blog/2015/09/16/reddit-impala/" target="_blank">Analyzing 1.7 Billion Reddit Comments with Blaze and Impala</a></span><br/>
In this post, we'll use Blaze and Impala to interactively query and explore a data set of approximately 1.7 billion comments (975 GB uncompressed) from the reddit website from October 2007 to May 2015. This data set was made available on July 2015 in a reddit post. The data set is in JSON format (one comment per line) and consists of the comment body, author, subreddit, timestamp of creation and other fields.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part4/" target="_blank">Let's Build A Simple Interpreter. Part 4.</a></span><br/>
In this part, you're going to learn how to parse and interpret arithmetic expressions with any number of multiplication and division operators in them. I will also talk quite a bit about another widely used notation for specifying the syntax of a programming language. It's called context-free grammars (grammars, for short) or BNF (Backus-Naur Form). For the purpose of this article I will not use pure BNF notation but more like a modified EBNF notation.<br/>

<span><a href="http://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/25/effective-python" target="_blank">Episode #25: Effective Python</a></span><br/>
What if you could bottle up all the wisdom and hard-fought experience of many expert Python developers and power up your own skills? That's what Brett Slatkin did and he put it in his book Effective Python. Brett has had a unique opportunity to learn the correct and efficient ways to write Python. He has worked at Google on Google App Engine (GAE) alongside greats such as Guido van Rossum and Alex Martelli. Join the conversation where we discuss some of that wisdom when we talk about Brett's book "Effective Python". <br/>

Doing Math with Python shows you how to use Python to delve into high school--level math topics like statistics, geometry, probability, and calculus. You'll start with simple projects, like a factoring program and a quadratic-equation solver, and then create more complex projects once you've gotten the hang of things. Creative coding challenges and applied examples help you see how you can put your new math and coding skills into practice. You'll write an inequality solver, plot gravity's effect on how far a bullet will travel, shuffle a deck of cards, estimate the area of a circle by throwing 100,000 "darts" at a board, explore the relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, and more.<br/>

Modular visual interface for GDB in Python. This comes as a standalone single-file .gdbinit which, among the other things, enables a configurable dashboard showing the most relevant information during the program execution. Its main goal is to reduce the number of GDB commands issued to inspect the current program status allowing the programmer to focus on the control flow instead.<br/>

We all love Django, right? Between python and the ability to quickly prototype and develop applications and web services, what's not to love? Even with these advantages, those pesky security issues are still a problem. Hence the need for a tool that explores the dos and don'ts when dealing with Django. Django.nV is an intentionally vulnerable application built to help developers identify and test security vulnerabilities in the Django web framework. This talk will review common security issues in Django and introduce Django.nV (now open source!) to help developers better secure their code.<br/>
