<pre>Everybody,

In order to save myself a major headache I'm hereby accepting PEP 492.

I've been following Yury's efforts carefully and I am fully confident that
we're doing the right thing here. There is only so much effort we can put
into clarifying terminology and explaining coroutines. Somebody should
write a tutorial. (I started to write one, but I ran out of time after just
describing basic yield.)

I've given Yury clear instructions to focus on how to proceed -- he's to
work with another core dev on getting the implementation ready in time for
beta 1 (scheduled for May 24, but I think the target date should be May 19).

The acceptance is provisional in the PEP 411 sense (stretching its meaning
to apply to language changes). That is, we reserve the right to change the
specification (or even withdraw it, in a worst-case scenario) until 3.6,
although I expect we won't need to do this except for some peripheral
issues (e.g. the backward compatibility flags).

I now plan to go back to PEP 484 (type hints). Fortunately in that case
there's not much *implementation* that will land (just the typing.py
module), but there's still a lot of language in the PEP that needs updating
(check the PEP 484 tracker &lt;<a href="https://github.com/ambv/typehinting/issues">https://github.com/ambv/typehinting/issues</a>&gt;).
