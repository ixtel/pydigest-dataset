<h2>Django 1.7 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>James Bennett</strong> on September 2, 2014 </span>

<p>It's here!</p>
<p>After nearly a year of development, today we're proud to announce the release of Django 1.7.</p>
<p>As always, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/releases/1.7">the release notes</a> cover everything in-depth, but some of the major highlights of Django 1.7 are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/">A new built-in database migration system</a>. Notes on <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/#upgrading-from-south">upgrading from South</a> (a popular third-party application providing migration functionality) are also available.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/applications/">A refactored concept of Django applications</a>. Django applications are no longer tied to the existence of a models files, and can now specify both configuration data and code to be executed as Django starts up.</li>
<li>Improvements to the model <tt class="docutils literal">Field</tt> API to support migrations and, in the future, to enable easy addition of composite-key support to Django's ORM.</li>
<li>Improvements for custom <tt class="docutils literal">Manager</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">QuerySet</tt> classes, allowing reverse relationship traversal to specify the <tt class="docutils literal">Manager</tt> to use, and creation of a <tt class="docutils literal">Manager</tt> from a custom <tt class="docutils literal">QuerySet</tt> class.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/checks/">An extensible system check framework</a> which can assist developers in detecting and diagnosing errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's just the tip of the iceberg; Django 1.7 is jam-packed with useful new features and functionality, and they're all covered in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/releases/1.7/">the 1.7 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>You can get Django 1.7 right now from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a> (along with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.7.checksum.txt">checksums</a>), or from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.7">the Python Package Index</a>.</p>

<h4>Bugfix releases</h4>
<p>Alongside Django 1.7, today we are issuing bugfix releases in the 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 series, which correct some bugs which existed after <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/aug/20/security/">the most recent security releases</a>.</p>
<p>Today's releases are:</p>

<p>Also, with the release of Django 1.7, Django 1.5 has reached end-of-life. As such, Django 1.5.10 is the final release of the 1.5 series. Django 1.6 will continue to receive support until the release of Django 1.8. Django 1.4 is a long-term support release, and will be supported until at least March of 2015.</p>
