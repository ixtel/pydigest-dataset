<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Lacey Williams Henschel and Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on May 5, 2015 </span>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that we will be supporting individuals who need financial assistance to attend <a class="reference external" href="https://2015.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US 2015</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve pledged $5,000 for the attendees of DjangoCon US 2015 to help meet the cost of tickets, travel, and accommodation for attendees who need financial support.</p>
<p>Our grants committee can supply discounted or free conference tickets and travel assistance. If you are a member of an under-represented group who will not be able to attend DjangoCon US without financial help, we strongly encourage you to apply for financial aid.</p>
<p>You can apply for financial aid by <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18Dyvhp8njJdWjCxXGBgK-AJgQpGfbQfYPfUDejPJzj0/viewform">filling out this application</a>. Applications need to be submitted by <strong>June 1</strong> in order to be considered (potential speakers should apply by 5/15).</p>
<p>The Django Software Foundation’s grants committee, along with a representative from DEFNA (Django Events Foundation North America), will review financial aid applications and notify those who have been accepted by June 15. Preference will be given to potential speakers and tutorial leaders, especially first-time speakers, and members of under-represented groups.</p>
<p>More information is available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://2015.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US 2015 website</a>.</p>
