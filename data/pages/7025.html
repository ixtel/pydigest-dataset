<html><body><div><div class="video-details-description"><p><a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> is great for building a large scale distributed data bus. Even a small cluster will happily accept and store thousands of messages per second, and make them available to consumers with low latency.</p>
<p>Kafka was chosen as the solution to our publish-subscribe infrastructure at <a href="http://www.takealot.com/">Takealot.com</a>. It supports our event-driven systems on the website, in the warehouses and in the office, as well as our analytics and machine learning projects.</p>
<p>This talk will</p>
<ul>
<li>introduce the basic Kafka principles that make things work,</li>
<li>outline how Kafka fits in with the rest of our architecture,</li>
<li>cover some of the practicalities of building Python-based Kafka services,</li>
<li>compare the two main Python libraries for Kafka, namely <a href="https://github.com/mumrah/kafka-python">kafka-python</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka">pykafka</a>,</li>
<li>demonstrate some practical applications at Takealot.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>Join in if you are interested in scalable distributed infrastructure.</p></div>
