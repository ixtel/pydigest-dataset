			<p>Django is a web framework based on Python which encourages pragmatic, clean design as well as rapid development. This high-level, open source framework allows the building of elegant, high-performing, feature-rich as well as clean applications quickly. Since the basis of Django is Python it is enriched with all the features as well as advantages of Python. The elegant and clean syntax has full support of a huge library of contributed as well as standard modules that cover a vast range of actions. Naturally, this ensures that it remains the best web framework for Python.</p>

It is here that Django stands apart; the URLs developed here are perfectly readable. This is not only good for the humans but for search engines as well since it is a factor for page importance, making it search engine friendly. URL construction of some other frameworks is somewhat close to it but the ease of creation makes using Django URLs a nice experience.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful ORM system-</strong> The Object-Relational Mapping system of this platform is really robust, supporting huge data systems set. Simple changing of a configuration file helps in engine switching. Thus changing database engines is a really flexible option for the developer. In fact this flexibility can be seen when you want to customize parts of a web site as well, so that the project’s need, can be suited. There is no need to rely on applications that are pre-built.</p>
<p><strong>Coding in Python-</strong> It is agreed by most programmers that one of the simplest existing programming languages is Python; belying its simplicity it is nevertheless extremely powerful as well. Its easily understandable syntax allows anybody to start coding and then make a smooth eventual transition to Django. Just like Python has a powerful backup, this framework also has a huge selection of third-party packages and libraries which may be integrated easily so that its features can be supplemented.</p>
<p><strong>High security levels-</strong> The manner of development as well as installation of the framework allows a greater security level when it is compared to any website developed in some other language or platform. This is due to the fact that your website’s source code is not directly and wholly exposed to the online viewers or the internet; the css files as well as html may be seen. Generally, there is dynamic generation of web pages which then use templates to reach the browser.</p>
<p><strong>An organized and structured MTV architecture-</strong> MTV stands for model, template and views. According to the coding scheme, the website building is done in phases. The setting up of database is done through the code’s abstract representatives, which are known as models. The views allow laying and individual coding of the features. Templates allow the designing of front-end designs as well as displays. Finally everything is woven as one by delicate code snippets and URL maps. Thus the various parts of a site are developed and then integrated together later on. This ensures that development does not stagger at any stage.</p>
<p><strong>Unique template system-</strong> Templates may not seem to be worth any efforts but the templates of the framework are different from the general ideas that we have. The templates developed help create a feel and look that is website-specific. This results in a unique look of the site. Another important feature of this system is that the templates are injected with programming logic. This allows in simplification of everything, making the adoption easy as well as clear and speeding up the development process.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, there can be no other better option for Python development than the Django framework. Apart from the huge benefits that the framework offers, the biggest reason for the adoption is that its very development has been on the Python language which naturally lends a lot of common, mutually shared advantages. A programmer who is adept in Python can easily carry on the process over Django without much of an extra effort.
