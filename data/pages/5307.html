Netflix is one of the largest and most innovative Internet companies. They represent approximately 35% of all network traffic on the entire Internet! They are one of or the biggest users of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). So you can imagine that they some huge technology challenges and some amazing solutions.  A significant part of those solutions are built with Python and that's what this episode is all about. Join Michael and Roy to learn all about how Netflix is using Python internally. It's a fascinating conversation. <br/>

<span><a href="http://podcastinit.com/allen-downey-computer-science.html" target="_blank">Podcast.__init__ Episode 14</a></span><br/>
In this episode we talked to professor and author Allen Downey. We discussed his work as a professor of computer science at Olin College and how he uses Python in the classroom. We also covered some of the numerous books that he has written and how making them open and freely available has yielded some interesting derivative works. Then we moved on to how statistics can be made accessible to people without a heavy math background.<br/>

Django REST Framework is an extremely popular and well-supported API frameworks, and arguably the most commonly used API library for Django. For years, enthusiasts have awaited the release of the long-heralded v3.0 release... and at long last, it's here! Found out what's been fixed, what's new, and what's on the roadmap for the future.<br/>

<span><a href="http://pbpython.com/best-practices.html" target="_blank">Best Practices for Managing Your Code Library</a></span><br/>
Over time you have probably developed a set of python scripts that you use on a frequent basis to make your daily work more effective. However, as you start to collect a bunch of python files, the time you take take to manage them can increase greatly. Your once simple development environment can become an unmanageable mess; especially if you do not try to have some consistency and common patterns for your development process. This article will discuss some best practices to manage your python code base so that you can sustain and maintain it over the years without pulling your hair out in the process.<br/>

<span><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/psinger/HypTrails/blob/master/tutorial/hyptrails_tutorial.ipynb" target="_blank">HypTrails Tutorial</a></span><br/>
HypTrails is a Bayesian approach that allows to compare hypotheses about human trails on the Web. Fundamentally, HypTrails is based on a first-order Markov chain model. Hypotheses are expressed as belief in parameters of the model. Then, HypTrails incorporates these hypotheses as elicited Dirichlet priors into a Bayesian inference process. The relative plausibility of hypotheses then is determined by their relative marginal likelihoods and Bayes factors. This ipython notebook provides a basic tutorial regarding the HypTrails approach.<br/>

<span><a href="http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/decision-making-under-uncertainty.html" target="_blank">Decision Making Under Uncertainty: An Introduction to Robust Optimization (Part 1)</a></span><br/>
Robust optimization (RO) is a tool that helps us improve our decisions in uncertain scenarios by allowing us to add uncertainty that is present in a problem directly to a model. In this series of posts, I will introduce the idea of robust optimization and its philosophy. While I will use a very simple example to motivate and present its methodology, it is important to note that there is much more to learn about RO and I hope these posts motivate you to explore RO and think about the cost of uncertainty.<br/>

Backpropagation is a common method for training a neural network. There is no shortage of papers online that attempt to explain how backpropagation works, but few that include an example with actual numbers. This post is my attempt to explain how it works with a concrete example that folks can compare their own calculations to in order to ensure they understand backpropagation correctly.<br/>

More physicists today are taking on the role of software developer as part of their research, but software development isn't always easy or obvious, even for physicists. This practical book teaches essential software development skills to help you automate and accomplish nearly any aspect of research in a physics-based field. Written by two PhDs in nuclear engineering, this book includes practical examples drawn from a working knowledge of physics concepts. You'll learn how to use the Python programming language to perform everything from collecting and analyzing data to building software and publishing your results.<br/>
