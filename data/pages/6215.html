<h1>The uWSGI project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-uwsgi-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for building hosting services.</p>
<p>Application servers (for various programming languages and protocols), proxies, process managers and monitors are all implemented
using a common api and a common configuration style.</p>
<p>Thanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended to support more platforms and languages.</p>
<p>Currently, you can write plugins in C, C++ and Objective-C.</p>
<p>The “WSGI” part in the name is a tribute to the namesake Python standard, as it has been the first developed plugin for the project.</p>
<p>Versatility, performance, low-resource usage and reliability are the strengths of the project (and the only rules followed).</p>

<p class="last">uWSGI is a very active project with a fast release cycle. For this reason the code and the documentation may not always be in sync.
We try to make our best to have good documentation but it is a hard work. Sorry for that.
If you are in trouble, the mailing list is the best source for help regarding uWSGI.
Contributors for documentation (in addition to code) are always welcome.</p>
