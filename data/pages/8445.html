    <p>"The crime that shames us all" is a <a href="http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/comment-analysis/WCMS_181922/lang--it/index.htm">32 billion USD</a> industry, benefitting from 21 million people. And <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/glotip/GLOTIP_2014_full_report.pdf">33 percent</a> are children. As technology has progressed, it has come to play a pivotal role in the human trafficking industry. </p>

<p>Over time, advancements in technology have restructured the ways in which human traffickers (and their businesses) operate; large scale trafficking has become simultaneously more profitable and more complex. Though, as technology can connect human traffickers to their victims, it also can serve to catch traffickers in action.</p>

<h2>How do human traffickers use technology?</h2>

<p>The rise of information exchange through web and mobile technology has provided more opportunities for traffickers to target victims more efficiently, through a screen, with the click of a button. Soliciting victims through <a href="http://communicationleadership.usc.edu/pubs/USC_Tech%20and%20Labor%20Trafficking_Feb2015.pdf">online job advertising</a> proves to be faster, more efficient, less expensive (than traditional billboard or newspaper advertising), and ultimately less risky (especially if you're <a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/internet/what-is-dark-web-how-access-dark-web-deep-3593569/">anonymous</a>). </p>

<p>Victims, often recruited through anonymous online advertisements seeking models, nannies, and domestic servants abroad, relocate to accept jobs and arrive to face very different sets of job descriptions. According to <a href="http://communicationleadership.usc.edu/pubs/USC_Tech%20and%20Labor%20Trafficking_Feb2015.pdf">USC's 2015 report</a> on technology and labor trafficking, migrant workers, often disconnected from technology and their social networks, are more susceptible to human trafficking. </p>

<p>As record numbers of <a href="http://syrianrefugees.eu/">war refugees</a> are moving across borders, <a href="http://astanatimes.com/2015/07/lets-use-un-world-day-against-trafficking-in-persons-to-help-end-this-crime/">their disconnection and mobility represent business opportunities</a> for human traffickers. But as more and more human traffickers are using technology to recruit victims, the importance for the use of <a href="https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/02/how-data-can-help-fight-human-trafficking/">technology and open data to fight human trafficking</a> becomes evident. </p>

<h2>How can technology be harnessed to stop human trafficking?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.polarisproject.org/">Polaris</a>, an anti-trafficking NGO that runs a US-based human trafficking hotline, <a href="http://www.traffickingresourcecenter.org/">National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC)</a>, has partnered with Palantir to map locations of reported human trafficking cases. Using this information, Polaris <a href="https://www.polarisproject.org/what-we-do/data-analysis-program">analyzes migration patterns and designs attacks</a> on these human trafficking networks using <strong>open data</strong>, big data, and insights from the hotlines.  </p>

<em>This map only reflects cases where the location of the potential trafficking was known. Some cases may involve more than one location. Data is from 2014.</em>

<p>In an effort to <a href="http://mscorpnews.blob.core.windows.net/ncmedia/2015/06/Tech-Human-Trafficking-Whitepaper.pdf">alter the risk-reward environment</a> for human traffickers by making human trafficking a riskier (technologically speaking) and less-lucrative industry, Microsoft has developed <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2015/06/22/fighting-human-trafficking-with-technology/">software and services</a> such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna">PhotoDNA</a> and the Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS), to grow citizen awareness, prevent trafficking recruitment, and expose existing trafficking.</p>

<p>On an individual level, <a href="https://github.com/EricSchles/data_festival_2015">Eric Schles</a>, a New York-based data scientist, has been <a href="http://podcastinit.com/episode-12-eric-schles-on-fighting-human-trafficking-with-python.html">fighting human trafficking using Python</a>. He developed <a href="https://github.com/EricSchles/traffickingGrab">TraffickingGrab</a>, a tool to scrape websites for evidence of human trafficking, and explains in a podcast how he uses Selenium and mechanizes Tor to scrape the deep web.  </p>
