<p>As a numerical platform and a substitute for MATLAB, Python reached maturity at least 2-3 years ago, and is now much better than MATLAB in many respects.  I tried to switch to Python from R around that time, and failed miserably. There are just too many R packages I use on a daily basis that have no Python equivalent. The absence of ggplot2 is enough to be a showstopper, but there are many more. In addition to this, R has a better syntax for data analysis. Consider the following basic example:</p>

<p><strong>Python</strong>: </p>

<pre><code>results = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>R</strong>: </p>

<pre><code>results &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data=A)
</code></pre>

<p>What do you consider more expressive? In R, you can think in terms of variables, and can easily extend a model, to, say,</p>

<pre><code>lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x2:x3, data=A)
</code></pre>

<p>Compared to R, Python is a low-level language for model building.</p>

<p>If I had fewer requirements for advanced statistical functions and were already coding Python on a larger project, I would consider Python as a good candidate. I would consider it also when a bare-bone approach is needed, either because of speed limitations, or because R packages don't provide an edge.</p>

<p>For those doing relatively advanced Statistics <em>right now</em>, the answer is a no-brainer, and is <strong>no</strong>. In fact, I believe Python will limit the way you think about data analysis. It will take a few years and many man-year of efforts to produce the module replacements for the 100 essential R packages, and even then, Python will feel like a language on which data analysis capabilities have been bolted on. Since R has already captured the largest relative share of applied statisticians across several fields, I don't see this happening any time soon. Having said that, it's a free country, and I know people doing Statistics in APL and C.</p>
