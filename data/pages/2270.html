			<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Programming is really really important thing and most of guys trying to learn it but they forget a necessary thing that is <strong>motivation</strong>. To do anything you need a motivation to do that thing and that’s an universal truth.</p>
<h2>Programming Not a Easy Way To Go</h2>
<p>Programming seems promising and may be you just make your mind to become next <strong>bill gates</strong> but that is not enough. You have to learn lot of programming languages, algorithms and most importantly about computers.</p>
<h2>What Need to be Done</h2>
<p>To get motivation to go ahead to deep in programming You need to start building crap out of your not to so good programming skills. If You want to keep up with programming you need to have motivation and that motivation comes from building stupid and not so usable programs. These programs may not be some kind of super stars but these will make things easier for you. You will be happy to see that and motivated to learn more and build better stuff.<br/>
This is secret of programming. <strong><em>If you want to be programmer then build crap</em></strong> cause this what makes you keep up with programming and you will be tempted to learn more and build stuff that will makes you life little easier and don’t hesitate to copy.</p>
<h2>What Craps You can Make</h2>
<p>There are lots of ideas lying around you, you just have to dig them. For example if you are movie buff and don’t want to download subtitles manually every-time you watch a movie. You can create a program which does it for you. You can create a script/program which takes backup of your important files at periodic intervals. There are no limit on these things and one day you will create some amazing stuff that will be not only used for you but also for other guys and off-course it will be crap no more.</p>
