<p>Your algorithm's performance must have <strong>low correlation</strong> to the general market's performance. This correlation is calculated as the beta-to-SPY, and it must be between 0.3 and -0.3. The algorithms that meet this requirement are placed at the top of the leaderboard and are marked with a badge.</p>
<p>Your algorithm must be <strong>hedged</strong>. It should hold both long and short positions simultaneously, or be entirely in cash. Hedged strategies reduce their market risk and correlation risk to individual positions. These algorithms are placed at the top of the leaderboard and are marked with a badge.</p>
<p>Your algorithm must have <strong>positive returns</strong>. It must make trades in both paper trading and backtesting. Algorithms meeting this criterion also are placed at the top of the leaderboard and are marked with a badge.</p>
<p>To generate your algorithm's score, its live trading performance is ranked against all of the other entries on the 7 criteria listed below. The ranks are averaged and scored on a scale of 0 to 100. Your score is quite volatile in the days immediately after you make your entry, and your score smooths out as your entry runs for a longer time period.</p>
<p>The best way to evaluate your algorithm is to use our backtest analysis tool to generate a 'tearsheet.' The tearsheet is chock-full of staticstics and comparisons to help you evaluate your algorithm's performance. It's the same tool that we use at Quantopian to <a href="posts/new-feature-comprehensive-backtest-analysis">evaluate algorithms</a> for the crowdsourced hedge fund.</p>
<p>These criteria were picked to encourage algorithm creation that matches our needs for the Quantopian <a href="/fund">Hedge Fund</a>.</p>
