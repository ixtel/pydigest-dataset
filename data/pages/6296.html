<h3><span>WHAT:</span></h3>
<p>Django Girls is a non-profit organization that provides resources for anyone to organize a free one-day workshop for women that teaches attendees how to start programming and make websites with HTML, CSS, Python, and Django. Started in July of 2014 in Berlin by two Polish girls: Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka. The website states that workshops have been held all over the world, and over 1600 women have participated. The website is beautifully organized, and online resources are provided such as tutorials and organizer’s manual, a help chat area, and though currently sparse, there is a page listing <a href="https://djangogirls.org/community/meetups" target="_blank">upcoming meetups</a> that are friendly to beginners, and a page listing <a href="https://djangogirls.org/community/jobs" target="_blank">jobs </a>with companies that hire beginners.</p>
<p>Django defined: From a Django Girls tutorial, <em>“Django (/ˈdʒæŋɡoʊ/ jang-goh) is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.”</em></p>
