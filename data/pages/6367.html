<p>This post is going to be a <em>greatest hits</em> of my open-source libraries and blog posts concerning the use of SQLite with Python. I'll also share a list of some other neat SQLite projects that you may not have heard of before.</p>

<p><code>python-lsm-db</code> is a set of Python bindings for <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/src4/doc/trunk/www/lsmusr.wiki">SQLite4's LSM database</a>. The SQLite4 LSM db is an embedded, ordered key/value store (like LevelDB) that supports nested transactions, cursors, single-writer/multiple-reader concurrency, and exceptional durability. LevelDB does not have nearly as many features, but in my testing the <code>python-lsm-db</code> library was almost as fast as the <code>plyvel</code> LevelDB bindings (and much faster than KyotoCabinet or BerkeleyDB).</p>
<p>The Python API for working with the LSM db is based on the <code>dict</code> API, with the added benefit that you can index slices of keys in addition to single keys. The API is small but powerful, and I envision the library being used as a foundation of sorts for other, higher-level storage applications.</p>
<p>For a quick introduction, you can check out the <a href="/blog/using-sqlite4-s-lsm-storage-engine-as-a-stand-alone-nosql-database-with-python/">announcement blog post</a></p>

<p><code>scout</code> is a RESTful full-text search server written in Python and powered by SQLite. You might think of it as a poor man's ElasticSearch. You can store multiple search indexes in a single SQLite database. Each search index consists of indexed documents and any user-defined metadata. Full-text searches can be performed over the index, and you can also filter on metadata values. The project also includes a lightweight Python client to go along with the search server.</p>

<p><code>sqlite-web</code> is a web-based SQLite database browser and management tool. You can browse tables, run queries, and there are GUIs for modifying the schema. You can even <strong>drop</strong> and <strong>rename</strong> columns (something SQLite does not support out of the box).</p>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/coleifer/peewee">peewee</a> and various extensions</h4>
<p><code>peewee</code> is a lightweight ORM with clean, predictable APIs for executing queries and working with relational data. There are a number of <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/playhouse.html">extension modules</a> packaged with peewee that you might find useful:</p>

<h3>Thanks for reading</h3>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this post. I hope you've learned about some projects you might not have heard about. If you're a staunch Postgres or MySQL user, give SQLite a try! It's a fantastic library.</p>
<p>Just a couple additional notes worth highlighting:</p>
