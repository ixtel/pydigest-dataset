<h1>Welcome To Dooku</h1>
<p>Dooku is a set of libraries for the Python programming language that provides
various useful stuff that you might need in everyday usage. The idea is
to provide a set of libraries and useful functions, just like Boost does
in C++ world.</p>
<p>It’s a good not only as a set of libraries, it also may be used as a some
kind of incubator where various developers can test and evolve their
projects. So please don’t hesitate to propose your library to be a part
of Dooku.</p>
<p>The library is self-contained and there are no dependencies it requires.
Just install it with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip</span></code> and enjoy!</p>
<div class="code bash highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ [sudo] pip install dooku
</pre></div>
