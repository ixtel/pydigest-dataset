<p>Now we need to draw the actual map. We do this in several steps; as I understand it, each step is drawing a different 'layer' onto our image.</p>
<p>First, we define a <strong>Basemap</strong> object. We pick a projection for it, choose a resolution (we should go with low, since we're looking at a big chunk of the world) and set a bounding box.</p>
<p>Once we have the Basemap, we call a few of its built-in methods to draw the coastlines, the country boundaries, fill the landmass with color, and draw the box around the map.</p>
<p>Finally, once we've done all that, we'll iterate over each of our points and draw them on the map, one at a time. Calling the map object itself will convert the lat and long coordinates to y and x on our map image (and remember that lat = y, long = x). The plot method will draw the point at the map itself. For each point, we'll use the get_size function above to convert the event count to a size. Finally, we'll fix point transparency (alpha) at 0.3: enough to see, without completely overwhelming the map, and providing a nice layering effect when many points cluster together. But again, more art than science; tweak it and see what looks good to you!</p>
