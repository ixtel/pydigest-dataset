<blockquote>
<p>This is an unordered collection of issues members of the <strong>so</strong>python community have found with the book <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>.  We noticed a general trend that users using LPTHW post questions <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">that don’t make a lot of sense</a> both on SO and in chat.  This is due to the structure and techniques used in the book.  We recommend <a href="http://sopython.com/wiki/What_tutorial_should_I_read%3F">these tutorials</a> instead.  If you’d like to discuss this more, <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/6/python">come chat</a>!</p>

<ol>
<li>Repeatedly asks the reader to ensure that the reader uses Python 2, stating that Python 3 will not be in general use for a long time.</li>
<li>Can have a quite condescending tone.</li>
<li>Even the Python 2 version is out of date. Uses Python 2.6 in the examples.</li>
<li>Exercise 3 on math does not talk about the rounding behaviour, about the <code>from __future__ import division</code>, or anything for that matter; details are left for the reader to find out. “Notice the math seems "wrong”? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. You need to use a <em>“floating point” number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.“</em></li>
<li>String formatting (Ex 6) just explains the <code>%</code> formatting</li>
<li>Ex 10 tells about Unicode escapes, of course without telling what the Unicode is or how to do it in Python.</li>
<li>Does not teach <code>with</code> for processing files</li>
<li>Calls <em>functions</em> <em>commands</em> until teaching the word <em>function</em>. Likewise modules are <em>features</em> until they are called modules.</li>
<li>First teaches the concept of command line and command line arguments and then (much later) proceeds to explain <em>functions</em> as some kind of <em>miniscripts</em> that take arguments akin to <code>argv</code>.</li>
<li>Ex 23 again says: ‘Avoid any project that mentions "Python 3”. That’ll only confuse you.’</li>
<li>Asks to memorize truth tables for Boolean ops, calls this “better than trying to understand it”</li>
<li>Really backwards teaching order, files taught before any control structures.</li>
<li>Ex 31 says this about testing whether a number falls into a range: “Use <code>0 &lt; x &lt; 10</code> or <code>1 &lt;= x &lt; 10</code>, which is classic notation, or use <code>x in range(1, 10)</code>.” And this is Python <strong>2</strong>. Even in Python 3 the <code>range</code> is <code>O(n)</code> for floats and most probably would fail.</li>
<li>Ex 37 - review - passingly mentions <code>raise</code> and <code>yield</code> in a table, that weren’t taught in previous exercises. Nor were the concepts of generators, iterators or even exceptions. <code>.next()</code> is used to get the next value from a generator.</li>
<li>After teaching methods in 38, Ex 39 teaches dictionaries and… how to build a hash table class?!</li>
<li>“Ex 40: Classes are like minimodules, objects are like mini-imports.”</li>
<li>Ex 41 defines “composition” as “The concept that a class can be composed of other classes as parts, much like how a car has wheels.” and then immediately defines “attribute” as “A property classes have that are from composition and are usually variables.”  This isn’t even wrong.</li>
<li>Ex 43 teaches non-pythonic stuff, like picking a random item from a list with <code>randint(0, len(x)-1)</code> instead of suggesting <code>random.choice</code></li>
<li>Ex 45 says “method is a function”.</li>
<li>Ex 46 teaches writing a package. Up until then the keyword arguments are not explained. A dictionary of arguments to <code>setup</code> is built, then applied with <code>**</code>…</li>
<li>Exceptions are finally taught in Ex 48, after the setup script. This is the <em>first</em> time a string is converted to an integer and exceptions handled appropriately.</li>
