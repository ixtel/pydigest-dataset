<p>Bloom filter: A Probabilistic data structure</p>








<p>This bloom filter is forked from pybloom, and its tightening ratio is changed to 0.9, and this ration is consistently used. Choosing r around 0.8 - 0.9 will result in better average space usage for wide range of growth, therefore the default value of model is set to LARGE_SET_GROWTH.
This is a Python implementation of the bloom filter probabilistic data
structure. The module also provides a Scalable Bloom Filter that allows a
bloom filter to grow without knowing the original set size.</p>
