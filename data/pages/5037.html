We are pleased to announce that Call for Proposal for PyCon PL 2015 is open.
We encourage everyone who is working with Python to submit his/her proposal. We are looking for a large variety of subjects on different levels of expertise from beginners to professionals. The deadline for proposal submission is 15th of July.
                    </strong>
                    <p>
So don't hesitate, write your proposal today and join the largest PyCon conference in Central Eastern Europe - we are expecting around 600-700 attendees this year. You can find more details below.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Submission</h4>
                    <p>
                    <strong><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/kh4kBkVF9G">To submit your proposal please fill and submit the form</a></strong>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Talks</h4>
                    <p>
The well known form of conferences’ presentation. Standard talk on a given subject, presented with help of slides. The usual time for this would be 30-45 minutes plus the Q&amp;A time slot of 15 minutes, for each presentation but if you predict that for some reason your presentation will take longer, let us know as well. It's also important to notice that not only strictly technical talks can be submitted. For example you can propose a community or project management related talk.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Workshops</h4>
<p>
The conference will feature 120-240 minutes workshops/tutorials on Python related topics. If you are interested, don't forget to include the requirements related to technical side of the tutorial. In other words what you need from our side to make this happen. Also, please provide an information what do you need from PyCon PL attendees to participate in your workshops (e.g. some software earlier installed on their laptops).



</p>
                    <h4>Discussion Panels</h4>
<p>
That's probably the most challenging type of proposal. You need to be well prepared and have broad knowledge in the area that is supposed to be the subject of the panel. If you have good plan we will aid you to make it happen.
</p>

                    <h4>Contests and other activities</h4>
<p>
Remember last year PySnake Dojo? If you have an idea of making a contest on our conference, then we would like to learn about it. Also if you think you can come up with some conception for entertainment activities, like e.g. last year board games night, then don't be shy and share it with us. We are open for all kinds of non-standard activities that could make PyCon PL conference better for our attendees.
</p>
                    <h4>Lightning talks</h4>
<p>
No, you don’t have to submit anything now. Submissions for lightning talks will be collected during the conference on flipcharts.
</p>
                    <h4>Due Date</h4>
                    <p>
                    The deadline for CfP is due to <strong>15th of July</strong>. After this date in the next 2 weeks speakers will be notified by an email about an acceptance or a rejection of the abstract.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Discounts and the conference booklet</h4>
                    <p>
Like the last year we are planning to publish a booklet which will have articles describing presented topics on the conference. For speakers with selected talks, this will be an option to get a free ticket. To get article accepted it is necessary to follow our article writing guidelines. The deadline for an article will be delivered after talk submission acceptance. If your article will be sent before the deadline you will get a free ticket, but don’t worry If you won’t deliver it or you will miss the deadline you will still get the 50% discount for the ticket.<br/>

Workshops’ accepted speakers will always get the free PyCon PL ticket under condition, that they will provide plan of the workshop.<br/>

It is also worth to mention that all PyCon PL tickets include accommodation and meals in the conference hotel.
