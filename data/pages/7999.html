<p>I have a Pyramid application which I can start using <code>pserve some.ini</code>. The ini file contains the usual paste configuration and everything works fine. In production, I use <code>uwsgi</code>, having a <code>paste = config:/path/to/some.ini</code> entry, which works fine too.</p>

<p>But instead of reading my configuration from a static ini file, I want to retrieve it from some external key value store. Reading the <code>paste</code> documentation and source code, I figured out, that there is a <code>call</code> scheme, which calls a python function to retrieve the "settings".</p>

<p>I implemented some <code>get_conf</code> method and try to start my application using <code>pserve call:my.module:get_conf</code>. If the module/method do not exist, I get an appropriate error, so the method seems to be used. But whatever I return from the method, I end up with this error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AssertionError: Protocol None unknown</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have no idea what return value of the method is expected and how to implement it. I tried to find documentation or examples, but without success. How do I have to implement this method?</p>
