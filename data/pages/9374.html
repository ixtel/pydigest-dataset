                    <p>This morning, <a class="reference external" href="http://jessenoller.com/">Jesse Noller</a>, the chair of PyCon US, suggested a meme, "<a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013">PyCon 2013</a> <strong>talks/tutorials I'd like to see</strong>". Here is my meme submission:</p>
<div class="section" id="python-obfuscation-contest">
<h2>1. Python Obfuscation Contest</h2>
<p>This <strong>certain-to-be-controversial talk idea</strong> would be where the speaker would solicit Pythonistas to submit a single arcane <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> code module that would have to display the text of "<em>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</em>" There would be a '<em>Expert</em>' category which would forbid the eval/exec functions. The "<em>Anything Goes Category</em>" would allow use of <strong>eval/exec</strong>. The conference talk would be where the speaker announces the winners and comments on the brilliant insanity of submissions.</p>

<div class="section" id="python-in-space">
<h2>2. Python in Space!!!!</h2>
<p>I want to hear any talk on how Python is used in space exploration or research. That includes NASA, SpaceX, ESA staffers or citizen scientists.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="template-language-shootout">
<h2>3. Template Language Shootout</h2>
<p>I want a benchmark heavy talk on the raw speed of various Python template systems, complete with hard numbers and pretty charts. This isn't just a matter of speed, but also a measure of terseness and total usage. The test code will need to be made public so it can be vetted, debated, and expanded upon.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-3-from-scratch">
<h2>4. Python 3 from scratch</h2>
<p>I want to see a talk that shows how by using Python 3 from the start, you content that you got a edge over Python 2.x. This case study should be as technical as possible and shouldn't have anything do with migrating from 2.x to 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fun-and-games-with-numpy">
<h2>5. Fun and games with NumPy</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> is an incredible library. It deserves a talk, specifically one where it is demonstrated to do something amazing. Maybe it's something scientific, maybe it's something crunching social data, maybe it's something I can't begin to imagine. Surprise and impress me!</p>
<p>There you go, my submission of 5 talks to the "<a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013">PyCon 2013</a> <strong>talks/tutorials I'd like to see</strong>" meme. What do you want to see?</p>
