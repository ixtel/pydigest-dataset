<p>If we are talking about reading and writing XLS files, basically <code>xlrd</code> and <code>xlwt</code> follow the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/sc/excelfileformat.pdf" rel="nofollow">OpenOffice.org document/specification</a> describing Excel's format and <em>BIFF</em> <em>(Binary Interchange File Format)</em> records to read and write XLS files. If you would inspect the <a href="https://github.com/python-excel/xlwt/" rel="nofollow"><code>xlwt</code> source code</a>, you would find it manipulates the BIFF records for everything needs to be written: creating workbook, worksheets, writing data, formatting, alignment etc.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd922181(v=office.12).aspx" rel="nofollow">XLSX</a> the story is a bit different. To read XLSX <code>xlrd</code> relies on the <a href="https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd/blob/master/xlrd/xlsx.py#L104" rel="nofollow">openxmlformats XML schemas</a> and <a href="https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd/blob/master/xlrd/xlsx.py#L24" rel="nofollow">use built into Python ElementTree XML parsers</a> (<code>cElementTree</code> if available, otherwise  <code>ElementTree</code>) to parse the XLSX file which is, to simplify, a zip archive containing XML files inside. Here is a good overview of what is inside the archive: </p>



<p>I would also recommend studying the <a href="http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.org/" rel="nofollow"><code>xlsxwriter</code> module</a> - from my point of view, the package is much better documented and <a href="https://github.com/jmcnamara/XlsxWriter" rel="nofollow">the code</a> is much more cleaner and readable than <code>xlwt</code> or <code>xlrd</code>.</p>
