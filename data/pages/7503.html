<html><body><div><p>properscoring runs on both Python 2 and 3. It requires NumPy (1.8 or
later) and SciPy (any recent version should be fine). Numba is optional,
but highly encouraged: it enables significant speedups (e.g., 20x faster)
for <tt>crps_ensemble</tt> and <tt>threshold_brier_score</tt>.</p>

<h2>Example: five ways to calculate CRPS</h2>
<p>This library focuses on the closely related
<a href="http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/verification/www/english/msg/ver_prob_forec/uos3b/uos3b_ko1.htm" rel="nofollow">Continuous Ranked Probability Score</a> (CRPS) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score" rel="nofollow">Brier Score</a>. We like
these scores because they are both interpretable (e.g., CRPS is a
generalization of mean absolute error) and easily calculated from a finite
number of samples of a probability distribution.</p>
<p>We will illustrate how to calculate CRPS against a forecast given by a
Gaussian random variable. To begin, import properscoring:</p>
<pre>import numpy as np
import properscoring as ps
from scipy.stats import norm
</pre>
<p>Exact calculation using <tt>crps_gaussian</tt> (this is the fastest method):</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ps.crps_gaussian(0, mu=0, sig=1)
0.23369497725510913
</pre>
<p>Numerical integration with <tt>crps_quadrature</tt>:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; ps.crps_quadrature(0, norm)
array(0.23369497725510724)
</pre>
<p>From a finite sample with <tt>crps_ensemble</tt>:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; ensemble = np.random.RandomState(0).randn(1000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ps.crps_ensemble(0, ensemble)
0.2297109370729622
</pre>
<p>Weighted by PDF values with <tt>crps_ensemble</tt>:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.linspace(-5, 5, num=1000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ps.crps_ensemble(0, x, weights=norm.pdf(x))
0.23370047937569616
</pre>
<p>Based on the <a href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/research/reports/2008/tr533.pdf" rel="nofollow">threshold decomposition</a> of CRPS with
<tt>threshold_brier_score</tt>:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; threshold_scores = ps.threshold_brier_score(0, ensemble, threshold=x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x[1] - x[0]) * threshold_scores.sum(axis=-1)
0.22973090090090081
</pre>
<p>In this example, we only scored a single observation/forecast pair. But
to reliably evaluate a forecast model, you need to average these scores across
many observations. Fortunately, all scoring rules in properscoring happily
accept and return observations as multi-dimensional arrays:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; ps.crps_gaussian([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], mu=0, sig=1)
array([ 1.45279182,  0.60244136,  0.23369498,  0.60244136,  1.45279182])
</pre>
<p>Once you calculate an average score, is often useful to normalize them
relative to a baseline forecast to calculate a so-called “skill score”,
defined such that 0 indicates no improvement over the baseline and 1
indicates a perfect forecast. For example, suppose that our baseline
forecast is to always predict 0:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; obs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; baseline_score = ps.crps_ensemble(obs, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).mean()
&gt;&gt;&gt; forecast_score = ps.crps_gaussian(obs, mu=0, sig=1).mean()
&gt;&gt;&gt; skill = (baseline_score - forecast_score) / baseline_score
&gt;&gt;&gt; skill
0.27597311068630859
</pre>
<p>A standard normal distribution was 28% better at predicting these five
observations.</p>
