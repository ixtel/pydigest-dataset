<p>A sample Python project</p>








<p>This is the description file for the project.</p>
<p>The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It
will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI, and should be written for
that purpose.</p>
<p>Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple “What’s New” section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.</p>
