                    <p>In Python, the <tt class="docutils literal">@cached_property</tt> decorator is a really nice piece of code. What it does is it caches the result of a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property">property</a> call. The cached result will persist as long as the instance does, so if the instance is passed around and the function subsequently invoked, the cached result will be returned.</p>
<p>If that doesn't make much sense, below is a snippet of code that shows the code and demonstrates it in action. As always, I'm using <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html">pytest</a> to validate my code:</p>

<p>This is great for encapsulating slow database queries, fetching results from third-party REST APIs, performing slow algorithms, and anything else where you would want to catch the results. Pretty neat, yeah!</p>
<p>While originally implemented for web frameworks such as Django, Flask, Pyramid, and Bottle, I've copy/pasted the <tt class="docutils literal">cached_property</tt> property from non-web project to project as a quick way to give my code a little boost. I got tired of doing this, and on May 17th, 2014 I decided to release it as a package called <cite>cached-property</cite> on <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cached-property">PyPI</a>. Using it is easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># assuming you've already done "pip install cached-property"</span>

<p>Hooray! No more copy/pasting for me! I was very pleased with myself.</p>
<p>Little did I know how fortunate I was for having released this package.</p>
<div class="section" id="don-t-copy-paste-code">
<h2>Don't Copy/Paste Code</h2>
<p>The very next day after I released the <cite>cached-property</cite> package, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Tinche">Tin Tvrtković</a> opened an issue asking for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/issues/6">better multithreaded support</a>.  To my shock and embarressment, my copy/pasted code could have been disastrous if brought into the wrong project. I had blindly been assuming that the code I hadn't bothered to try and understand worked under any situation, when in reality it had been designed for working within the context of a web framework.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Tin <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydanny/cached-property/pull/9">submitted a pull request</a>, and now the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cached-property</span></tt> package also includes a <tt class="docutils literal">@threaded_cached_property</tt> decorator. Thank you Tin!</p>
<p>However, the lessons of the experience had been burned into my brain.</p>

<div class="section" id="lessons-learned">
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Don't copy/paste code blindly from project to project.</li>
<li>If you are repeatedly moving code from project to project, take the time to understand what the code is actually doing.</li>
<li>Instead of copy/pasting code from project to project, make a package and ask for input from others. If making a package feels like too much work, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage">cookiecutter-pypackage</a> makes creating new packages really easy.</li>
