All talks and workshops are given by members of the community, and we'd like to invite you to submit a proposal to present a talk or to run a workshop. When selecting the programme, we will aim to choose sessions that promise to be interesting and enjoyable, while ensuring the line-up is as varied and balanced as possible.<br/>

PyData presentations are intended to share knowledge and experience. We welcome talks letting attendees know how how you are using tools in your work, but discourage any with the aim of selling a product. If you are interested in presenting a talk or tutorial, we encourage your submission(s). To see the type of topics presented at previous PyData events, please look at our past conference sites at pydata.org or check out the videos on Youtube and Vimeo.<br/>

Within the Ubuntu world, by Ubuntu 16.04 LTS next April they want Python 3 by default and potentially to only have Python 3.5. In upstream Debian for their 9.0 Stretch release they are also hoping for no Python2 by default, albeit the Stretch release is much further out. <br/>

Justin Elszasz, curator of the website The Training Set, will lay bare the faulty premises on which he embarked on public data investigations using Python.  Having formal training in mechanical engineering, Justin will explain why he started looking at city data in the first place, the development of his website, and how he's using iPython notebooks to explore open data.  His recent investigations include a data-driven response to complaints about parking citations as well as digging into just how much money city police earn in Baltimore.<br/>
