MySQL Fabric is a relatively new project in the MySQL ecosystem and it focuses on building a framework for working with large deployments of MySQL Servers. The architecture of MySQL Fabric is such that it allows extensions to be added and the first two extensions that we added were support for high-availability using </p><i>High-Availability groups</i><p> (</p><i>HA groups</i><p>) and sharding to manage very large databases. The first version of sharding have hash and range sharding implemented as well as procedures for moving and splitting shards.</p><p>
A critical part of working with a collection of servers is the ability to route transactions to the correct servers, and for efficiency reasons we quite early decided to put this routing logic into the connectors. This avoid one extra network hop and hence improve performance by reducing latency, but it does require that the connectors containing routing logic, caches, and support for fetching data from MySQL Fabric. Putting the routing logic into the connector also make it easy to extend the API to add new support that applications can require.</p><p>
MySQL Fabric 1.4.2 is distributed as part of MySQL Utilities 1.4.2. To avoid confusion, we have changed the version numbering to match the version of MySQL Utilities it is distributed in.
