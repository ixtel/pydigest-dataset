<p>Python package for providing Mozilla's CA Bundle.</p>








<p><a href="http://certifi.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">Certifi</a> is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for
validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity
of TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">Requests</a> project.</p>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p><tt>certifi</tt> is available on PyPI. Simply install it with <tt>pip</tt>:</p>
<pre>$ pip install certifi
</pre>
</div>
<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the
built-in function:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; import certifi

&gt;&gt;&gt; certifi.where()
'/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'
</pre>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3>1024-bit Root Certificates</h3>
<p>Browsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys are
unacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. For this
reason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) certificate from its
bundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e. 2048-bit or greater key)
certificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla removed these certificates from
its bundle, <tt>certifi</tt> removed them as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, old versions of OpenSSL (less than 1.0.2) sometimes fail to
validate certificate chains that use the strong roots. For this reason, if you
fail to validate a certificate using the <tt>certifi.where()</tt> mechanism, you can
intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your bundle by calling
<tt>certifi.old_where()</tt> instead. This is not recommended in production: if at
all possible you should upgrade to a newer OpenSSL. However, if you have no
other option, this may work for you.</p>
