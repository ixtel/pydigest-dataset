					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Today, we’re excited to let you know that <strong>PyCharm Educational Edition 2.0</strong> is coming this September. Since the previous release we’ve improved a lot of things, implemented new functionality, added new programming courses, and fixed bugs.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2015/09/PyCharmEdu20.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3397 aligncenter" alt="PyCharmEdu20" src="http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/files/2015/09/PyCharmEdu20.png"/></a></p>
<p>The best things about this edition will stay unchanged – it’s still going to be a completely free and open source software, specifically designed to help beginners with little or no previous coding experience to learn programming quickly and efficiently, while using a modern professional tool.</p>
<p>The list of improvements can be found on the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-educational/nextversion/">Coming in v2.0</a> page. They are:</p>
<ul>

<li>Simplified UI</li>
<li>Scratch Files</li>
<li>Quick Package Installation</li>
<li>Integration with Stepic</li>
<li>Various course creation improvements</li>
</ul>
