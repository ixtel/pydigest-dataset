<p>
We are happy to announce that </p><b>we have successfully relaunched the PSF Python Job Board</b><p>.
</p><p>
After almost one year of development and lots of work by our volunteers  and contractors, we are now live with the new Python job board system.

</p><h3>
New modern system</h3>
<p>
The new system is fully integrated into the python.org website. Job  submitters can create an account on the system, log in and directly  submit their job posting for approval by the PSF Job Board Team.
</p><p>
The team can then review the postings, check them against our submission  criteria, possibly fixing some formatting, and then approve or reject  the postings directly through a web interface.
</p><p>
No more sending dozens of emails back and forth to get the job template fixed and adding jobs to the website by hand.

</p><h3>
Thank you to our volunteers</h3>
<p>
The new system was a major effort for all of us and I'd like to say  thank you from the PSF to everyone who helped make this happen (in  alphabetical order):
