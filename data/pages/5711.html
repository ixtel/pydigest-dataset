<p>This project releases automatically on PyPi… by a bot. It’s then downloaded by bots and mirrors.</p>
<p>If you want to be a real jerk, download it.</p>

<h2>Why is this project necessary?</h2>
<p>To correct statistics.</p>
<p>Thousands of hits are generated by bots and mirrors, often way more than humans create. This makes it very difficult to collect statistics from PyPi.</p>
<p>The great maintainers of PyPi should not suffer anymore headaches inflicted by bots and mirrors. We as a community can try to provide a meaningful service for correcting those statistics already offered.</p>
