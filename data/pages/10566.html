<p>Real-time Audio time-scale and pitch modification.</p>








<p># aupyom</p>
<p>[![Build Status](<a href="https://travis-ci.org/pierre-rouanet/aupyom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pierre-rouanet/aupyom" rel="nofollow">https://travis-ci.org/pierre-rouanet/aupyom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pierre-rouanet/aupyom</a>)</p>
<p>Real-time Audio time-scale and pitch modification Python library.</p>
<p># Documentation</p>
<p>Aupyom is the pure-python library designed to allow for quick and easy sounds mixing. It has been designed to let you shift the pitch and change the time-scale of sounds in real time.</p>
<p>As aupyom API is really simple, you only need to know a few methods to start playing, the documentation is given as few demonstration notebooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Playing and mixing multiple sounds](./examples/Playingandmixingmultiplesounds.ipynb)</li>
<li>[Live modification of the pitch and time-scale of sounds](./examples/Livemodificationofthepitchandtime-scaleofsounds.ipynb)</li>
</ul>
<p># Installation</p>
<p>The last stable release is available on PyPI. It can be install via:</p>
<p><tt>`bash
pip install aupyom
`</tt></p>
<p>You can also install it from source:
<tt>`bash
python setup.py install
`</tt></p>
<p>## Dependencies</p>
<p>Aupyom works with Python &gt;= 2.7 and Python&gt;=3.4.</p>
<p>Aupyom requires different libraries:
* [numpy](<a href="http://www.numpy.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.numpy.org</a>): for the low-level sound processing
* [librosa](<a href="https://github.com/bmcfee/librosa" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bmcfee/librosa</a>): for higher-level sound processing and IO
* [sounddevice](<a href="http://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.org/</a>): a python bindings for the [PortAudio](<a href="http://www.portaudio.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.portaudio.com</a>) library - used to play sounds</p>
<p># Integration with Poppy robots</p>
<p>Aupyom has been originally designed in the context of the [Poppy-project](<a href="https://www.poppy-project.org" rel="nofollow">https://www.poppy-project.org</a>) aiming at developing open-source and easy-to-use robots. They are notably used in educational context for teaching computer science and discover IoT and robotics.</p>
<p>[Dedicated demonstration notebooks]() have been designed showing how the movement of a robot can be used to lively modify sound pitch and time-scale!</p>
<p>[![Vimeo Preview](./doc/vimeo-preview.jpg)](<a href="https://vimeo.com/107599850" rel="nofollow">https://vimeo.com/107599850</a>)</p>
<p>Thanks to that, aupyom has also been connected to [Snap!](<a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu" rel="nofollow">http://snap.berkeley.edu</a>) a variant of the famous visual programming language allowing the design of interface for intuitively modifying and mixing of sounds.</p>
