			<p>Hi there folks. It’s been a long time since I last published a post. I have been busy. However in this post I am going to share some really informative tips and tricks which you might not have known about. So without wasting any time lets get straight to them:<span id="more-580"/></p>
<p><strong>Enumerate</strong></p>
<p>Instead of doing:</p>
<pre>i = 0 
for item in iterable: 
    print i, item 
    i += 1</pre>
<p>We can do:</p>
<pre>for i, item in enumerate(iterable):
    print i, item</pre>
<p>Enumerate can also take a second argument. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(enumerate('abc')) 
[(0, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (2, 'c')] 

&gt;&gt;&gt; list(enumerate('abc', 1)) 
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]</pre>
<p><strong>Dict/Set comprehensions</strong></p>
<p>You might know about list comprehensions but you might not be aware of <em>dict/set comprehensions</em>. They are simple to use and just as effective. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>my_dict = {i: i * i for i in xrange(100)} 
my_set = {i * 15 for i in xrange(100)}

# There is only a difference of ':' in both</pre>
<p><strong>Forcing float division:</strong></p>
<p>If we divide whole numbers Python gives us the result as a whole number even if the result was a float. In order to circumvent this issue we have to do something like this:</p>
<pre>result = 1.0/2</pre>
<p>But there is another way to solve this problem which even I wasn’t aware of. You can do:</p>
<pre>from __future__ import division 
result = 1/2
# print(result)
# 0.5

</pre>
<p>Voila! Now you don’t need to append <em>.0</em> in order to get an accurate answer. Do note that this trick is for Python 2 only. In Python 3 there is no need to do the import as it handles this case by default.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Server</strong></p>
<p>Do you want to quickly and easily share files from a directory? You can simply do:</p>
<pre># Python2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# Python 3
python3 -m http.server</pre>
<p>This would start up a server.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating Python expressions</strong></p>
<p>We all know about <em>eval</em> but do we all know about <em>literal_eval</em>? Perhaps not. You can do:</p>
<pre>import ast 
my_list = ast.literal_eval(expr)</pre>
<p>Instead of:</p>
<pre>expr = "[1, 2, 3]" 
my_list = eval(expr)</pre>
<p>I am sure that it’s something new for most of us but it has been a part of Python for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Profiling a script</strong></p>
<p>You can easily profile a script by running it like this:</p>
<pre>python -m cProfile my_script.py</pre>
<p><strong>Object introspection</strong></p>
<p>You can inspect objects in Python by using <em>dir(). </em>Here is a simple example:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = [1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(foo) 
['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', 
'__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__delslice__', ... , 
'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 
'reverse', 'sort']</pre>
<p><strong>Debugging scripts</strong></p>
<p>You can easily set breakpoints in your script using the <em>pdb </em>module. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>import pdb
pdb.set_trace()</pre>
<p>You can write <em>pdb.set_trace()</em> anywhere in your script and it will set a breakpoint there. Super convenient. You should also read more about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">pdb</a> as it has a couple of other hidden gems as well.</p>
<p><strong>Simplify if constructs </strong></p>
<p>If you have to check for several values you can easily do:</p>
<pre>if n in [1,4,5,6]:</pre>
<p>instead of:</p>
<pre>if n==1 or n==4 or n==5 or n==6:</pre>
<p><strong>Reversing a list/string</strong></p>
<p>You can quickly reverse a list by using:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::-1]
[4, 3, 2, 1]

# This creates a new reversed list. 
# If you want to reverse a list in place you can do:

a.reverse()

</pre>
<p>and the same can be applied to a string as well:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = "yasoob"
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo[::-1]
'boosay'</pre>
<p><strong>Pretty print</strong></p>
<p>You can print dicts and lists in a beautiful way by doing:</p>
<pre>from pprint import pprint 
pprint(my_dict)</pre>
<p>This is more effective on dicts. Moreover, if you want to pretty print json quickly from a file then you can simply do:</p>
<pre>cat file.json | python -m json.tools</pre>
<p><strong>Ternary Operators</strong></p>
<p>Ternary operators are shortcut for an if-else statement, and are also known as a conditional operators. Here are some examples which you can use to make your code compact and more beautiful.</p>
<pre>[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]
x, y = 50, 25
small = x if x &lt; y else y</pre>
