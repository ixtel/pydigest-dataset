<h2>Django team seeks help maintaining Oracle and Oracle GIS backends</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on August 17, 2015 </span>

<p>Several members of the Django team that have previously provided Oracle
expertise no longer work with Oracle in their day jobs, and therefore, the team
is seeking new contributors who have an ongoing interest in the backend.</p>
<p>Ideally, the team seeks to move the Oracle backend from "built-in" status, to a
pip-installable backend that would be maintained under the "django" GitHub account.
Your duties would include monitoring a build that runs with Django master and the
latest version of the Oracle backend and fixing any issues that arise. To help with
the continuous integration infrastructure, knowledge of maintaining Oracle servers
would also be a plus, but these duties could be split among several people. Please
introduce yourself on the <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/WC4lThxMNyU/discussion">django-developers mailing list</a> if this is something you
are interested in.</p>
<p>Also, the Oracle GIS backend has been broken for several months and
no one has answered <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/django-developers/2ritQ26PRLI/discussion">requests for help</a> on the django-developers and
geodjango mailing lists. If no one helps out, this backend will be dropped in
Django 1.9. This is the least used backend according to the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Owv-Y_beohyCm9o2xPamdBnvjreNYoWai3rDloKZxWw/viewanalytics#start=publishanalytics">Django Developers
Community Survey</a>, receiving 5 votes out of more than 3,000 responses.</p>
