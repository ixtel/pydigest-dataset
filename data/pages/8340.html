<p>The purpose of Know It’s Ok is to make it as easy as possible to run your tests
while you’re debugging your code.  In particular, it’s main features are:</p>
<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Know It’s Ok is available from PyPI:</p>
<pre>$ pip install know_its_ok
</pre>
<p>It’s only dependencies are pytest and pytest-cov, which should both be
installed automatically.</p>
</div>
<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>You can run Know It’s Ok from anywhere in your package’s repository:</p>
<pre>$ ok
</pre>
<p>You can also specify individual tests to run (by default they will all be run).
You don’t need to specify the complete name of a test, any substring of a test
will be understood.  For example, if you have a test called <tt>test_foo.py</tt>,
you can use this command to run it:</p>
<pre>$ ok foo
</pre>
<p>You can also specify arguments that should be passed through to <tt>pytest</tt>
(this won’t work if the argument to <tt>pytest</tt> also matches the name of one of
your tests, but in practice this is never a problem):</p>
<pre>$ ok --pdb
</pre>
<p>In order to discover your tests simply, Know It’s Ok is very opinionated about
the organization of your code.  In particular:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your code must be version controlled using <tt>git</tt>.</li>
<li>Your tests must be stored in a directory called <tt>tests/</tt>, which itself
must be located in the top level of your repository.</li>
<li>Inside the <tt>tests/</tt> directory, your tests must match the pattern:
<tt><span class="pre">??_test_*.py</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Your tests must be written using the <tt>pytest</tt> framework.</li>
<li>Your package must be located in a directory containing and <tt>__init__.py</tt>
file.</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of these expectations are not met, the code should raise an exception.</p>
