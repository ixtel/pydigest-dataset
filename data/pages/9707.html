<li>Problems with the new branch measurement in 4.1 beta 1 were <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span>:<ul>
<li>Class docstrings were considered executable.  Now they no longer are.</li>
<li><code><span>yield</span> <span>from</span></code> and <code><span>await</span></code> were considered returns from functions, since
they could tranfer control to the caller.  This produced unhelpful “missing
branch” reports in a number of circumstances.  Now they no longer are
considered returns.</li>
<li>In unusual situations, a missing branch to a negative number was reported.
This has been <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span>, closing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/466/impossible-missed-branch-to-a-negative">issue 466</a>.</li>

<li>Branch analysis has been rewritten: it used to be based on bytecode, but now
uses AST analysis.  This has changed a number of things:<ul>
<li>More code paths are now considered runnable, especially in
<code><span>try</span></code>/<code><span>except</span></code> structures.  This may mean that coverage.py will
identify more code paths as uncovered.  This could either raise or lower
your overall coverage number.</li>
<li>Python 3.5’s <code><span>async</span></code> and <code><span>await</span></code> keywords are properly supported,

<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/129/misleading-branch-coverage-of-empty">issue 129</a>: functions with only a docstring for a body would

<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/212/coverage-erroneously-reports-partial">issue 212</a>: code in an <code><span>except</span></code> block could be incorrectly marked as
a missing branch.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/146/context-managers-confuse-branch-coverage">issue 146</a>: context managers (<code><span>with</span></code> statements) in a loop or <code><span>try</span></code>
block could confuse the branch measurement, reporting incorrect partial
branches.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/422/python35-partial-branch-marked-as-fully">issue 422</a>: in Python 3.5, an actual partial branch could be marked as
complete.</li>

      <ul>
<li>When combining data files, unreadable files will now generate a warning
instead of failing the command.  This is more in line with the older
coverage.py v3.7.1 behavior, which silently ignored unreadable files.
Prompted by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/418/json-parse-error">issue 418</a>.</li>
<li>The –skip-covered option would skip reporting on 100% covered files, but
also skipped them when calculating total coverage.  This was wrong, it should
only <span class="changelog-highlight-inc">remove</span> lines from the report, not change the final answer.  This is now
<span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span>, closing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/423/skip_covered-changes-reported-total">issue 423</a>.</li>
<li>In 4.0, the data file recorded a summary of the system on which it was run.
Combined data files would keep all of those summaries.  This could lead to
enormous data files consisting of mostly repetitive useless information. That
summary is now gone, <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixing</span> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/415/repeated-coveragedataupdates-cause">issue 415</a>.  If you want summary information,
get in touch, and we’ll figure out a better way to do it.</li>
<li>Test suites that mocked os.path.exists would experience strange failures, due
to coverage.py using their mock inadvertently.  This is now <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span>, closing
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/416/mocking-ospathexists-causes-failures">issue 416</a>.</li>
<li>Importing a <code><span>__init__</span></code> module explicitly would lead to an error:
<code><span>AttributeError:</span> <span>'module'</span> <span>object</span> <span>has</span> <span>no</span> <span>attribute</span> <span>'__path__'</span></code>, as reported

<li>Code that uses <code><span>sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())</span></code> used to incur a more than 2x
speed penalty.  Now there’s no penalty at all. <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixes</span> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/397/stopping-and-resuming-coverage-with">issue 397</a>.</li>

<li>When using <code><span>report</span> <span>--skip-covered</span></code>, a message will now be included in the
report output indicating how many files were skipped, and if all files are
skipped, coverage.py won’t accidentally scold you for having no data to

<li>Coverage.py is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.  See NOTICE.txt for
details.  Closes <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issues/313/add-license-file-containing-2-3-or-4">issue 313</a>.</li>

<li>The XML report now includes a <code><span>missing-branches</span></code> attribute.  Thanks, Steve
Peak.  This is not a part of the Cobertura DTD, so the XML report no longer
references the DTD.</li>
<li>Missing branches in the HTML report now have a bit more information in the
right-hand annotations.  Hopefully this will make their meaning clearer.</li>
<li>All the reporting functions now behave the same if no data had been

”.coveragerc”, it is treated as if it were True.  This means setup.cfg is
also examined, and a missing file is not considered an error (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/357/behavior-changed-when-coveragerc-is">issue 357</a>).</li>
<li>Wildly experimental: support for measuring processes started by the
multiprocessing module.  To use, set <code><span>--concurrency=multiprocessing</span></code>,
either on the command line or in the .coveragerc file (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/117/enable-coverage-measurement-of-code-run-by">issue 117</a>). Thanks,
Eduardo Schettino.  Currently, this does not work on Windows.</li>
<li>A new warning is possible, if a desired file isn’t measured because it was
imported before coverage.py was started (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/353/40a3-introduces-an-unexpected-third-case">issue 353</a>).</li>
<li>The <cite>coverage.process_startup</cite> function now will start coverage measurement
only once, no matter how many times it is called.  This <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixes</span> problems due
to unusual virtualenv configurations (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/340/keyerror-subpy">issue 340</a>).</li>
<li>Added 3.5.0a1 to the list of supported CPython versions.</li>

<li>Reports now use file names with extensions.  Previously, a report would
describe a/b/c.py as “a/b/c”.  Now it is shown as “a/b/c.py”.  This allows
for better support of non-Python files, and also <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/69/coverage-html-overwrite-files-that-doesnt">issue 69</a>.</li>
<li>The XML report now reports each directory as a package again.  This was a bad
regression, I apologize.  This was reported in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/235/package-name-is-missing-in-xml-report">issue 235</a>, which is now
<span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span>.</li>
<li>A new configuration option for the XML report: <code><span>[xml]</span> <span>package_depth</span></code>
controls which directories are identified as packages in the report.
Directories deeper than this depth are not reported as packages.
The default is that all directories are reported as packages.
Thanks, Lex Berezhny.</li>
<li>When looking for the source for a frame, check if the file exists. On
Windows, .pyw files are no longer recorded as .py files. Along the way, this

      <ul>
<li>Officially support PyPy 2.4, and PyPy3 2.4.  Drop support for
CPython 3.2 and older versions of PyPy.  The code won’t work on CPython 3.2.
It will probably still work on older versions of PyPy, but I’m not testing
against them.</li>
<li>Plugins!</li>
<li>The original command line switches (<cite>-x</cite> to run a program, etc) are no
longer supported.</li>
<li>A new option: <cite>coverage report –skip-covered</cite> will reduce the number of
files reported by skipping files with 100% coverage.  Thanks, Krystian
Kichewko.  This means that empty <cite>__init__.py</cite> files will be skipped, since
they are 100% covered, closing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/315/option-to-omit-empty-files-eg-__init__py">issue 315</a>.</li>
<li>You can now specify the <code><span>--fail-under</span></code> option in the <code><span>.coveragerc</span></code> file

<li>The <code><span>COVERAGE_OPTIONS</span></code> environment variable is no longer supported.  It was
a hack for <code><span>--timid</span></code> before configuration files were available.</li>
<li>The HTML report now has filtering.  Type text into the Filter box on the
index page, and only modules with that text in the name will be shown.
Thanks, Danny Allen.</li>
<li>The textual report and the HTML report used to report partial branches
differently for no good reason.  Now the text report’s “missing branches”
column is a “partial branches” column so that both reports show the same
numbers.  This closes <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/342/console-and-html-coverage-reports-differ">issue 342</a>.</li>
<li>If you specify a <code><span>--rcfile</span></code> that cannot be read, you will get an error

<li>The <code><span>--debug</span></code> switch can now be used on any command.</li>
<li>You can now programmatically adjust the configuration of coverage.py by
setting items on <cite>Coverage.config</cite> after construction.</li>
<li>A module run with <code><span>-m</span></code> can be used as the argument to <code><span>--source</span></code>, <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixing</span>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/328/misbehavior-in-run-source">issue 328</a>.  Thanks, Buck Evan.</li>
<li>The regex for matching exclusion pragmas has been <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span> to allow more kinds
of whitespace, <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixing</span> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/334/pragma-not-recognized-if-tab-character">issue 334</a>.</li>
<li>Made some PyPy-specific tweaks to improve speed under PyPy.  Thanks, Alex
Gaynor.</li>
<li>In some cases, with a source file missing a final newline, coverage.py would
count statements incorrectly.  This is now <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span>, closing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/293/number-of-statement-detection-wrong-if-no">issue 293</a>.</li>
<li>The status.dat file that HTML reports use to avoid re-creating files that
haven’t changed is now a JSON file instead of a pickle file.  This obviates
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/287/htmlpy-doesnt-specify-pickle-protocol">issue 287</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/237/htmlcov-with-corrupt-statusdat">issue 237</a>.</li>

thanks to Peter Portante for initial implementation, and to Joe Jevnik for
the final insight that completed the work.</li>
<li>Options are now also read from a setup.cfg file, if any.  Sections are

<li>Wildcards in <code><span>include=</span></code> and <code><span>omit=</span></code> arguments were not handled properly

uniformly, closing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/143/omit-doesnt-seem-to-work-in-coverage">issue 143</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/163/problem-with-include-and-omit-filename">issue 163</a>.  <strong>NOTE</strong>: it is possible
that your configurations may now be incorrect.  If you use <code><span>include</span></code> or
<code><span>omit</span></code> during reporting, whether on the command line, through the API, or
in a configuration file, please check carefully that you were not relying on
the old broken behavior.</li>
<li>The <strong>report</strong>, <strong>html</strong>, and <strong>xml</strong> commands now accept a <code><span>--fail-under</span></code>

total coverage numbers will generally now be lower if you are measuring
branch coverage.</li>
<li>When installing, now in addition to creating a “coverage” command, two new
aliases are also installed.  A “coverage2” or “coverage3” command will be
created, depending on whether you are installing in Python 2.x or 3.x.

coverage.py would report its own code as part of the results.  Now it won’t,

<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/197/line-numbers-in-html-report-do-not-align">issue 197</a>, thanks Marius Gedminas.</li>
<li>When specifying a directory as the source= option, the directory itself no
longer needs to have a <code><span>__init__.py</span></code> file, though its sub-directories do,
to be considered as source files.</li>

the <code><span>extra_css</span></code> configuration value in the <code><span>[html]</span></code> section.</li>

pragmatic <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fix</span> for <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/82/tokenerror-when-generating-html-report">issue 82</a>.</li>
<li>The <code><span>-m</span></code> switch on <code><span>coverage</span> <span>report</span></code>, which includes missing line numbers
in the summary report, can now be specified as <code><span>show_missing</span></code> in the

<li>When running a module with <code><span>coverage</span> <span>run</span> <span>-m</span> <span>&lt;modulename&gt;</span></code>, certain details
of the execution environment weren’t the same as for
<code><span>python</span> <span>-m</span> <span>&lt;modulename&gt;</span></code>.  This had the unfortunate side-effect of making
<code><span>coverage</span> <span>run</span> <span>-m</span> <span>unittest</span> <span>discover</span></code> not work if you had tests in a

<li>An explicit include directive to measure files in the Python installation

<a href="http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/138/include-should-take-precedence-over-is">issue 138</a>.</li>

    <div class="package-version__description">
      <ul>
<li>The HTML report now has hotkeys.  Try <code><span>n</span></code>, <code><span>s</span></code>, <code><span>m</span></code>, <code><span>x</span></code>, <code><span>b</span></code>,
<code><span>p</span></code>, and <code><span>c</span></code> on the overview page to change the column sorting.
On a file page, <code><span>r</span></code>, <code><span>m</span></code>, <code><span>x</span></code>, and <code><span>p</span></code> toggle the run, missing,
excluded, and partial line markings.  You can navigate the highlighted
sections of code by using the <code><span>j</span></code> and <code><span>k</span></code> keys for next and previous.
The <code><span>1</span></code> (one) key jumps to the first highlighted section in the file,
and <code><span>0</span></code> (zero) scrolls to the top of the file.</li>
<li>The <code><span>--omit</span></code> and <code><span>--include</span></code> switches now interpret their values more
usefully.  If the value starts with a wildcard character, it is used as-is.
If it does not, it is interpreted relative to the current directory.
Closes <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/121/filename-patterns-are-applied-stupidly">issue 121</a>.</li>
<li>Partial branch warnings can now be pragma’d away.  The configuration option
<code><span>partial_branches</span></code> is a list of regular expressions.  Lines matching any of
those expressions will never be marked as a partial branch.  In addition,
there’s a built-in list of regular expressions marking statements which should
never be marked as partial.  This list includes <code><span>while</span> <span>True:</span></code>, <code><span>while</span> <span>1:</span></code>,
<code><span>if</span> <span>1:</span></code>, and <code><span>if</span> <span>0:</span></code>.</li>
<li>The <code><span>coverage()</span></code> constructor accepts single strings for the <code><span>omit=</span></code> and
<code><span>include=</span></code> arguments, adapting to a common error in programmatic use.</li>
<li>Modules can now be run directly using <code><span>coverage</span> <span>run</span> <span>-m</span> <span>modulename</span></code>, to
mirror Python’s <code><span>-m</span></code> flag.  Closes <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/95/run-subcommand-should-take-a-module-name">issue 95</a>, thanks, Brandon Rhodes.</li>
<li><code><span>coverage</span> <span>run</span></code> didn’t emulate Python accurately in one small detail: the
current directory inserted into <code><span>sys.path</span></code> was relative rather than
absolute. This is now <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixed</span>.</li>
<li>HTML reporting is now incremental: a record is kept of the data that
produced the HTML reports, and only files whose data has changed will
be generated.  This should make most HTML reporting faster.</li>
<li>Pathological code execution could disable the trace function behind our
backs, leading to incorrect code measurement.  Now if this happens,
coverage.py will issue a warning, at least alerting you to the problem.
Closes <a href="http://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/93/copying-a-mock-object-breaks-coverage">issue 93</a>.  Thanks to Marius Gedminas for the idea.</li>
<li>The C-based trace function now behaves properly when saved and restored
with <code><span>sys.gettrace()</span></code> and <code><span>sys.settrace()</span></code>.  This <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixes</span> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/125/coverage-removes-decoratortoolss-tracing">issue 125</a>
and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/123/pyeval_settrace-used-in-way-that-breaks">issue 123</a>.  Thanks, Devin Jeanpierre.</li>
<li>Source files are now opened with Python 3.2’s <code><span>tokenize.open()</span></code> where
possible, to get the best handling of Python source files with encodings.
Closes <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/107/codeparser-not-opening-source-files-with">issue 107</a>, thanks, Brett Cannon.</li>
<li>Syntax errors in supposed Python files can now be ignored during reporting
with the <code><span>-i</span></code> switch just like other source errors.  Closes <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/115/fail-gracefully-when-reporting-on-file">issue 115</a>.</li>
<li>Installation from source now succeeds on machines without a C compiler,
closing <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/80/is-there-a-duck-typing-way-to-know-we-cant">issue 80</a>.</li>
<li>Coverage.py can now be run directly from a working tree by specifying
the directory name to python:  <code><span>python</span> <span>coverage_py_working_dir</span> <span>run</span> <span>...</span></code>.
Thanks, Brett Cannon.</li>
<li>A little bit of Jython support: <cite>coverage run</cite> can now measure Jython
execution by adapting when $py.class files are traced. Thanks, Adi Roiban.
Jython still doesn’t provide the Python libraries needed to make
coverage reporting work, unfortunately.</li>
<li>Internally, files are now closed explicitly, <span class="changelog-highlight-fix">fixing</span> <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ned/coveragepy/issue/104/explicitly-close-files">issue 104</a>.  Thanks,

measurement: if a <code><span>--source</span></code> module has no Python source to measure, or is
never encountered at all, or if no data is collected.</li>
<li>The reporting commands (report, annotate, html, and xml) now have an

<li>The run command now supports <code><span>--include</span></code> and <code><span>--omit</span></code> to control what
modules it measures. This can speed execution and reduce the amount of data

<li>Since coverage.py 3.1, using the Python trace function has been slower than
it needs to be.  A cache of tracing decisions was broken, but has now been

<li>Reports now have a column of missed line counts rather than executed line
counts, since developers should focus on reducing the missed lines to zero,
rather than increasing the executed lines to varying targets.  Once
suggested, this seemed blindingly obvious.</li>
<li>Line numbers in HTML source pages are clickable, linking directly to that
line, which is highlighted on arrival.  Added a link back to the index page
at the bottom of each HTML page.</li>
<li>Programs that call <code><span>os.fork</span></code> will properly collect data from both the child

<li>Code in the Python standard library is not measured by default.  If you need
to measure standard library code, use the -L command-line switch during
execution, or the cover_pylib=True argument to the coverage() constructor.</li>
<li>Source annotation into a directory (-a -d) behaves differently.  The
annotated files are named with their hierarchy flattened so that same-named
files from different directories no longer collide.  Also, only files in the
current tree are included.</li>

      <p>Major overhaul.</p>
<ul>
<li>Coverage.py is now a package rather than a module.  Functionality has been
split into classes.</li>
<li>The trace function is implemented in C for speed.  Coverage.py runs are now
much faster.  Thanks to David Christian for productive micro-sprints and
other encouragement.</li>
<li>Executable lines are identified by reading the line number tables in the
compiled code, removing a great deal of complicated analysis code.</li>
<li>Precisely which lines are considered executable has changed in some cases.
Therefore, your coverage stats may also change slightly.</li>
<li>The singleton coverage object is only created if the module-level functions
are used.  This maintains the old interface while allowing better
programmatic use of Coverage.py.</li>
<li>The minimum supported Python version is 2.3.</li>
