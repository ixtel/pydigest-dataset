<p>interact with virtualenv site-packages as if they were in your working directory</p>








<p># envy [![Build Status](<a href="https://travis-ci.org/shaunvxc/envy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunvxc/envy" rel="nofollow">https://travis-ci.org/shaunvxc/envy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunvxc/envy</a>) [![PyPI version](<a href="https://badge.fury.io/py/envy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/envy" rel="nofollow">https://badge.fury.io/py/envy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/envy</a>)</p>
<p>### Why?</p>
<p>Have you ever needed to look at some code living in one of your virtual environments? And then spent a good 3 or 4 seconds typing out the path? At which point you were weary about making changes/setting breakpoints in your site-packages without first creating a backup… which then needed to be restored again after testing, and yada yada yada.  <em>This workflow is annoying and tedious</em>.</p>
<p><cite>envy</cite> is a utility that allows you to <strong>interact with all of the site-packages</strong> in your currently active <cite>virtualenv</cite> as if they were in your <strong>current working directory</strong></p>
<p>### How?
Let’s say you are working in a virtual environment for a project <cite>foo</cite> but are getting errors thrown from one of <cite>foo</cite>’s depedencies– a library called <cite>bar</cite>.  The stacktrace tells us the error was thrown from <cite>baz.py</cite>.  Using <cite>envy</cite>, simply run (from anywhere in your file system):</p>
<p><cite>(foo)$ envy edit bar/baz.py</cite></p>
<p>and you’ll instantly be looking at the point-of-error from your favorite text editor!  This is pretty awesome, considering that this would normally require at some point typing out (or copy pasting– which <strong>is also</strong> annoying) a full path like this: <cite>~/.virtualenvs/foo/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/bar/baz.py</cite>.</p>
<p>##### Great, the file is open, but I shouldn’t create a backup before editing a file in my site-packages? :confused:
This is a good practice, but with <cite>envy</cite>, there is no need! <cite>envy</cite> will create a back up of the entire package (in the above example, <cite>bar</cite>) in <cite>~/.envies/foo/bar</cite>.  Throw down some <cite>pdb</cite>’s, <cite>print</cite>’s, or any little hack you want.  Whenever you are ready to restore the package back to it’s original state, you need only run:</p>
<p><cite>(foo)$ envy clean bar</cite></p>
<p>And it’ll be like you were never there!</p>
<p>### Wait, there’s more! :pig2: :egg:
With <cite>envy</cite> you can also test changes on a library that you maintain and have checked out locally.</p>
<p>Say you maintain a library <cite>ham</cite>, as well as another project <cite>eggs</cite> that depends on <cite>ham</cite>.  You want to test out some of your recent changes to <cite>ham</cite>, but are far from ready to start messing with the versioning or running <cite>setup.py install</cite>. With <cite>envy</cite> you can very quickly sync the changes from your local dev copy of <cite>ham</cite> to the one that lives <cite>eggs</cite> virtual environment like so:</p>
<p><cite>(eggs)$ envy sync ham</cite></p>
<p>You can also sync indivual files:</p>
<p><cite>(eggs)$ envy sync ham/spam.py</cite></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the <cite>envy sync</cite> commands must be run from within your local copy of the package you are syncing (i.e. <cite>ham</cite>)</p>
<p>As with <cite>envy edit</cite>, an backup of the package’s (<cite>ham</cite>’s) state will be created automatically.  As with before, to restore the original state:</p>
<p><cite>(eggs)$ envy clean ham</cite></p>
<p>#### No talk, straight usage :no_mouth:</p>
<p>Edit any file from any site-package installed in your active virtual environment:</p>
<p><cite>(active-virtualenv)$ envy edit any-site-package/any-file.py</cite></p>
<p>Discard any and all edits and return <cite>any-site-package</cite> to its original state:</p>
<p><cite>(active-virtualenv)$ envy clean any-site-package</cite></p>
<p>You can run both <cite>edit</cite> and <cite>clean</cite> from anywhere in your filesystem, as long as you are in a virtualenv that contains the package you ask it for.</p>
<p>To sync all local changes from some <cite>random_lib</cite> to where its copy in <cite>some-virtualenv</cite>, run:</p>
<p><cite>(some-virtualenv):dev/random_lib$ envy sync random_lib</cite></p>
<p>For the time being, <cite>sync</cite> commands cannot be run as flexibly as <cite>edit</cite> and <cite>clean</cite> (they will only work when run from within the python package you wish to sync)- although it would certainly be possible to improve this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>
<cite>envy edit</cite> uses the <cite>$EDITOR</cite> environment varible to launch a text editor– if this is not set, simply add:</p>
<p><cite>export EDITOR=your_editor_of_choice</cite></p>
<p>to your .bashrc file.</p>
<p>##Installation</p>
<p><cite>$ pip install envy</cite></p>
<p>####Future work:
- allow syncing from anywhere on filesystem
- improve test coverage
- add optional virtualenv argument to allow syncing/editing to nonactive virtualenvs</p>
