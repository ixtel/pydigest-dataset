<p>The authors of Argon2 also were very helpful to get the library to compile on ancient versions of Visual Studio for ancient versions of Python.</p>
<p>The documentation also quotes frequently from the Argon2 <a href="https://password-hashing.net/argon2-specs.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a> to avoid mistakes by rephrasing.</p>

<h4>msinttypes</h4>
<p>In order to be able to compile on Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 which are required for Python 2.6/2.7 and 3.3/3.4 respectively, we also ship two C headers with integer types.
They are from the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/" rel="nofollow">msinttypes project</a> (<a href="https://github.com/chemeris/msinttypes" rel="nofollow">auto-import on GitHub</a>) and licensed under New BSD:</p>
