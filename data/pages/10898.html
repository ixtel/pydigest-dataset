                                This week on Talk Python To Me, we'll dive into the world of typeface and font development. Even though we spend our days immersed in fonts, from our computer interfaces, signs, books, television and more, much of the process and thinking about fonts is invisible to us. If we dig into font development, we'd see that Python is a key component of the font developer's toolkit. </p><more/>

<p>This week we have a very special guest to tell us all about it. We'll talk with Just van Rossum about how he has helped pioneer the use of Python for font development.
