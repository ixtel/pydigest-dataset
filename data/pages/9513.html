<p>I am learning <a href="http://objectpath.org/reference.html" rel="nofollow">ObjectPath</a> for python and have found out, e.g., how to do an exact match on an attribute:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import objectpath
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree = objectpath.Tree({'doc': {'title': 'Purple is Best Color'}})
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.execute('$..*[@.title is "Purple is Best Color"]').next()
{'title': 'Purple is Best Color'}
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sense to me; I want to start from the root (<code>$</code>) and recursively (<code>..</code>) find all (<code>*</code>) items (<code>@</code>) for which title == "Purple is Best Color". And it works!</p>

<p>But then I try something similar with the <code>in</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tree.execute('$..*["Purple" in @.title]').next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
StopIteration
</code></pre>

<p>Huh? Seemed like a natural way to tweak the condition, but it's not quite right. </p>

<p>In the manual, I read that <code>in</code> <em>checks if the result of the left side of expression is in array, object or string</em>, and that <em>in objects, keys are matched.</em> (maybe that's my issue, but not sure quite what it means here). I think that my current <code>@</code> is indeed a string...?</p>

<p>Considering the above, what could I be missing here?</p>
