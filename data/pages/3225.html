<h1 class="title">PyCon Sweden Call For Proposals - Less Than a Week Left</h1>
<p>Since PyCon Sweden was a success last year, we're doing it again this year, only slightly bigger, hopefully even better!
We'll move in to a prime venue at <a class="reference external" href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/sweden/hilton-stockholm-slussen-STOSLHI/index.html">Hilton Slussen</a> on the waterfront in central Stockholm, and keep aiming for the
fantastic Swedish spring weather we had last year, with the conference running on the 12-13th of May.</p>
<p>We are  accepting proposals until the 16th of February - go ahead and <a class="reference external" href="http://goo.gl/forms/V0tgG0pQ1G">submit your proposal today</a>!</p>
<p>Anyone with any level of Python knowledge is a candidate for a good topic at this conference. If you're a first time speaker with limited experience, contact us - we will help you out! As we get attendees of all kinds, we need speakers of all kinds. In all ways and manners, we try to assemble the most diverse conference we can, and we do that with your help.</p>
<p>Whether you got started with Python last month or you've been around for 20 years, we think you've got something to share. The Python community is stronger than ever and we're still reaching new areas, new industries, and new users. Be a part of the growing Python community and help shape its future. You don't need to be a well traveled professional speaker to get on stage at PyCon Sweden. What matters is the topics, the materials, and the drive to present things to this community.</p>
<p>You can see the full CFP at our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pycon.se/">homepage</a>, where you can also find information on how to become a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pycon.se/sponsorship.html">sponsor</a>.</p>
<p>See you in Stockholm!</p>
