European Space Agency (ESA) will be funding further development of MicroPython, to determine the suitability of the language for space-based applications, in particular for payloads. Research and development will focus on making MicroPython more robust for critical embedded systems, with emphasis on determinism of the virtual machine and memory management. <br/>

All Python programmers use the import statement, but do you really know how it works and what it allows? Join David and Michael to take a deep dive into diabolical issues related to modules, packages, and imports. When we're done, you'll finally be ready to unleash your million line micro framework on the world!<br/>

<span><a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/06/13/lomb-scargle-in-python/" target="_blank">Fast Lomb-Scargle Periodograms in Python</a></span><br/>
Despite the importance of this method, until recently there have not been any (in my opinion) solid implementations of the algorithm available for easy use in Python. That has changed with the introduction of the gatspy package, which I recently released. In this post, I will compare several available Python implementations of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and discuss some of the considerations required when using it to analyze data.<br/>

<span><a href="http://blog.dataquest.io/blog/predicting-upvotes/" target="_blank">NLP in python -- predicting HN upvotes from headlines</a></span><br/>

<span><a href="http://blog.lerner.co.il/why-you-should-almost-never-use-is-in-python/" target="_blank">Why you should almost never use "is" in Python</a></span><br/>
In this post, which is the result of many questions and discussions I've had with students in my Python classes, I'm going to try to describe the reasons for this -- and along the way, describe some parts of how Python's objects are allocated, and what we mean when we say that two objects are "the same."<br/>

<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtsCf2v75Vw" target="_blank">Winning elections with Python and Django</a></span><br/>
In september the Malmö branch of political party Vänsterpartiet got it's highest results ever in the local elections, due in part to an in-house tool for organizing large-scale activism. Richard Olsson will tell us about the experiences of using Python and the Django framework in an iterative process to build a tool for political change.<br/>

In this Part 1, first, we look at the tail of an asset return distribution and compress our knowledge on Value-at-Risk (VaR) to extract the essence required to understand why VaR-stuff is not the best card in our deck. Next, we move to a classical Bayes' theorem which helps us to derive a conditional probability of a rare event given... yep, another event that (hypothetically) will take place.<br/>

This post describes the implementation in Python of a "Least Frequently Used" (LFU) algorithm cache eviction scheme with complexity O(1). The algorithm is described in this <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/caching/a-constant-algorithm-for-implementing-the-lfu-cache-eviction-scheme.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> written by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani. The naming in the implementation follows the naming in the paper.<br/>

Google Forms is a service that allows you to collect information via simple web forms. One of the useful features is that the forms will automatically save your data to a Google Sheet. This article will walk through how to create a form, authenticate using OAuth 2 and read all the responses into a pandas dataframe.<br/>

This tutorial shows the ease with which a web application can be created in Python that integrates with the Twitter API. The walkthrough is not designed to implement any stunning functionality but to show the linkages between application metadata in the developer center, the OAuth implementation and the authorization required to implement particular types of functionality. Hopefully, when armed with this knowledge a developer will have all the facilities at their disposal to create their own imaginative Twitter integrations.<br/>

<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/dellis23/disrupt" target="_blank">disrupt</a></span><br/>

<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/ankitaggarwal011/PyCNN" target="_blank">PyCNN</a></span><br/>
Cellular Neural Networks (CNN) are a parallel computing paradigm similar to neural networks, with the difference that communication is allowed between neighboring units only. Image Processing is one of its application. CNN processors were designed to perform image processing; specifically, the original application of CNN processors was to perform real-time ultra-high frame-rate (&gt;10,000 frame/s) processing unachievable by digital processors. This python library is the implementation of CNN for the application of Image Processing.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex" target="_blank">Pex</a></span><br/>
pex is a library for generating .pex (Python EXecutable) files which are executable Python environments in the spirit of virtualenvs. pex is an expansion upon the ideas outlined in PEP 441 and makes the deployment of Python applications as simple as cp. pex files may even include multiple platform-specific Python distributions, meaning that a single pex file can be portable across Linux and OS X.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/jgilhutton/pyxiewps" target="_blank">pyxiewps</a></span><br/>
Pyxiewps is a wireless attack tool writen in python that uses reaver, pixiewps, macchanger and aircrack to retrieve the WPS pin of any vulnerable AP in seconds. There are already a bunch of tools, reaver included, that can attack an access point (AP) using the Pixie Dust vulnerability but I wanted to do something automatic, fast and user friendly, so here we are.<br/>

<br/>
<span><a href="https://github.com/Psycojoker/redbaron" target="_blank">RedBaron</a></span><br/>
RedBaron is a python library and tool powerful enough to be used into IPython solely that intent to make the process of writting code that modify source code as easy and as simple as possible. That include writing custom refactoring, generic refactoring, tools, IDE or directly modifying you source code into IPython with an higher and more powerful abstraction than the advanced texts modification tools that you find in advanced text editors and IDE<br/>

<span><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/introduction-to-regular-expressions-tickets-17313395833" target="_blank">Webinar: Introduction to Regular Expressions</a></span><br/>
In this Webinar, I aim to demonstrate not only that regular expressions can be useful, but that the basics aren't that hard, and that you can start to use them in your day-to-day work almost immediately. Examples will use Python, but the regexps we use should work on many modern languages, including Ruby and JavaScript. There will be many live-coding demonstrations, as well as ample opportunities for Q&amp;A.<br/>
