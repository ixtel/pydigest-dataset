<h1>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python!</h1>
<p>Greetings, Earthling! Welcome to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</p>
<p><strong>This is a living, breathing guide.</strong>  If you’d like to contribute,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide">fork us on GitHub</a>!</p>
<p>This handcrafted guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python
developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and
usage of Python on a daily basis.</p>
<p>This guide is <strong>opinionated</strong> in a way that is almost, but not quite, entirely
<em>unlike</em> Python’s official documentation. You won’t find a list of every Python web framework
available here. Rather, you’ll find a nice concise list of highly recommended
options.</p>
<p>Let’s get started! But first, let’s make sure you know where your towel is.</p>
