<h2>Django Software Foundation announces Diversity Statement</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on June 16, 2015 </span>

<p>While the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation (DSF)</a> has passed a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/">Community Code of Conduct</a> that indirectly establishes that we consider diversity to be a desirable goal, and the DSF has funded many activities that promote diversity, we've never made a clear public statement that we consider diversity a desirable goal.</p>
<p>We'd like to address that.</p>
<p>The membership of the Django Software Foundation has just drafted, and the DSF Board has approved, a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/">Diversity Statement</a> for the Django community. The draft draws heavily on the diversity statement published by <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/legal/diversity">Dreamwidth</a>.</p>
<p>These words, by themselves, won't change much about the way the DSF operates. However, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">The Zen of Python</a> tells us that "explicit is better than implicit". Making a statement like this is a signal to the broader community about what sort of community Django aspires to be -- and if we ever fail to meet those aspirations, we can be called on it so that we can do better.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this statement, or any other feedback for the DSF, please <a class="reference external" href="mailto:foundation@djangoproject.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 20 June 2015</strong>: Corrected reference to PEP20, rather than PEP8.</p>
