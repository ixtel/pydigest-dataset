<p>Choosing the right framework in developers’ world sometimes is similar to choosing between Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro in automotive world. The same purpose, parity of characteristics, lots of features, etc. This list tends to be endless, but, let’s make things a bit clearer by comparing these frameworks step by step.</p>

<p><span><strong>Django</strong></span></p>

<p>Django was initially born in a newsroom to deal with strict time-limits and to exclude lots of routine activity during the development process. Django project is represented as an app. You can combine different applications to build a more scalable and functional system with separate application modules that will not interfere with each other. The key Django’s philosophy means that the final code is pretty verbose, so it can be read by the developer who has no working experience with some particular product.</p>

<p><strong>Websites that are based on Django:</strong><em> Bitbucket, Disqus, Instagram, Mahalo, Mozilla, NASA, National Geographic, Pinterest, Rdio, Reddit Gifts, The Guardian, Washington Post.</em></p>

<p>As the main platform, Django is often used in the science world.</p>

<p><span><strong>Ruby On rails</strong></span></p>

<p>RoR has the "coding by convention” paradigm in its root (core), providing developers with simplicity and flexibility without getting them overwhelmed with many intermediate decisions to be made. Rails framework is strong in “magic”: that’s the way developers call its automation. With RoR you can only specify some “unusual” aspects of your application and the rest will be done automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Websites on RoR:</strong><em> Basecamp, Bloomberg, GitHub, Heroku, Hulu, Scribd, Shopify, SlideShare, SoundCloud, Twitter, Zendesk.</em></p>

<p>As the main platform, RoR shows its strengths in startups.</p>

<p><span><strong>MODEL</strong></span></p>

<p>In Django all models representations are declared via a models.py. However, in order to handle attributes' behavior, you must create two additional attributes and parameters. RoR handles these aspects on its own.</p>

<p>A Django model file can show you model fields type and database structure for application, whereas in RoR schema.rb provides info about field types and database structure while model files keep models themselves. When you initiate a migration, RoR takes care of any updates to this file.</p>

<p>Both RoR and Django imply implicit methods that allow a developer to find a database record by a model attribute. find_by for RoR and filter() for Django.</p>

<p><span><strong>Migrations</strong></span></p>

<p>RoR supports migrations out-of-the-box via Rails generator. Before version 1.7, Django used the South third-party library for these operations. As of version 1.7, South library is not used any more, Django itself has this functionality.</p>

<p><span><strong>Queries</strong></span></p>

<p>Both frameworks support object relational mapping, so SQL queries are created quite easily.</p>

<p><span><strong>Controller</strong></span></p>

<p>Difference here is slight. Model-View-Template in Django is an alternative to Model-View-Controller in RoR. Django view performs a role of a MVC controller as well as template of a Django is a MVC view. Similar principles in regard to MVC resolve into common functionalities of these two frameworks.</p>

<p><strong><span>View</span></strong></p>

<p>Rails has an interesting feature that is a downside from the other point of view: it uses ERB Templating, which allows generating arbitrary text from templates themselves. Django is stricter here and if there are any objects that were not passed in from the controller; you will not be able to select them.</p>

<p><span><strong>Assets</strong></span></p>

<p>RoR has powerful built-in assets that allow performing different optimizations with CSS and JavaScript files.</p>

<p>In Django you should take care of this on your own. However, if you want to achieve something similar to Rails assets, you can install django-pipeline or any other third-party application out of available ones, that are numerous.</p>

<p><span><strong>Routes</strong></span></p>

<p>RoR makes things simple thanks to coding by convention, automatically routing GET requests to controllers and setting all general routes. Django, on the other hand, uses the power of regular expressions (it provides developers with a built-in simple validation): but you still can do anything with routes and routing rules – they should be declared by hand.</p>

<p><strong><span>Testing</span></strong></p>

<p>At this point, Django and RoR are very similar, but RoR gets additional points due to automation. There are also additional applications that transform testing to joy.</p>

<p><strong><span>Authentication</span></strong></p>

<p>Django uses a configurable user model of a user authentication, whereas RoR doesn't have any built-in user authentication at all.</p>

<p><strong><span>Similarities</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Open-sourced</li>
	<li>Both are MVC and follow DRY principle</li>
	<li>Automatic queries</li>
	<li>Easy routing system</li>
	<li>Powerful template system with lots of filters and predefined functions</li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong>Differences</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Django is written in Python and Rails in Ruby.</li>
	<li>RoR doesn’t provide you with any authentication services out-of-the-box, you should use some of third-parties solutions.</li>
	<li>RoR seems to have a bigger and less fractured community and more career opportunities for developers. It is also a rookie-friendlier, which allows more people to be involved in the development process.</li>
	<li>Django has a stronger backward compatibility due to less frequent changes to its API.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It may seem that RoR has a slight advantage, but that's not quite so. When writing code, automation is very helpful, but it’s not always necessary – some fragments can be added by hand much faster (instead of editing a bunch of default values) and you will be absolutely sure that these fragments will work in any situations. And if you plan refactoring or scaling, more verbose and readable code will make it simple for developers to control each step and eliminate possible errors.</p>

<p>So, Django or Rails? This is your own choice, according to your experience, professional skills and goals.</p>

<p>Django is an excellent choice for those who are looking for more customization, tech-maniacs who like to play with the code, spending a lot of time “under the hood”. It has a wider application in data science and business, which resulted in more professional applications. If you care about backward compatibility, Django is also better than RoR here.</p>

<p>RoR concentrates on faster launching of your Web applications, getting you more familiar with framework concepts and allowing you to implement some complex features faster thanks to automation and shortcuts.</p>
