</p><h1>Django REST Framework</h1>

<p>Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.</p>
<p>Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:</p>

<hr/>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="./img/quickstart.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Above</strong>: <em>Screenshot from the browsable API</em></p>

<p>REST framework requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python (2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5)</li>
<li>Django (1.7+, 1.8, 1.9)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following packages are optional:</p>


<p>Install using <code>pip</code>, including any optional packages you want...</p>
<pre><code>pip install djangorestframework
pip install markdown       # Markdown support for the browsable API.
pip install django-filter  # Filtering support
</code></pre>
<p>...or clone the project from github.</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:tomchristie/django-rest-framework.git
</code></pre>
<p>Add <code>'rest_framework'</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> setting.</p>
<pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'rest_framework',
)
</code></pre>
<p>If you're intending to use the browsable API you'll probably also want to add REST framework's login and logout views.  Add the following to your root <code>urls.py</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>urlpatterns = [
    ...
    url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the URL path can be whatever you want, but you must include <code>'rest_framework.urls'</code> with the <code>'rest_framework'</code> namespace. You may leave out the namespace in Django 1.9+, and REST framework will set it for you.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at a quick example of using REST framework to build a simple model-backed API.</p>
<p>We'll create a read-write API for accessing information on the users of our project.</p>
<p>Any global settings for a REST framework API are kept in a single configuration dictionary named <code>REST_FRAMEWORK</code>.  Start off by adding the following to your <code>settings.py</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    # Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions,
    # or allow read-only access for unauthenticated users.
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly'
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to make sure you've also added <code>rest_framework</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>.</p>
<p>We're ready to create our API now.
Here's our project's root <code>urls.py</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from rest_framework import routers, serializers, viewsets

# Serializers define the API representation.
class UserSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('url', 'username', 'email', 'is_staff')

# ViewSets define the view behavior.
class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer

# Routers provide an easy way of automatically determining the URL conf.
router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'users', UserViewSet)

# Wire up our API using automatic URL routing.
# Additionally, we include login URLs for the browsable API.
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^', include(router.urls)),
    url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework'))
]
</code></pre>
<p>You can now open the API in your browser at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a>, and view your new 'users' API. If you use the login control in the top right corner you'll also be able to add, create and delete users from the system.</p>

<p>Can't wait to get started? The <a href="tutorial/quickstart/">quickstart guide</a> is the fastest way to get up and running, and building APIs with REST framework.</p>

<p>The tutorial will walk you through the building blocks that make up REST framework.   It'll take a little while to get through, but it'll give you a comprehensive understanding of how everything fits together, and is highly recommended reading.</p>

<p>There is a live example API of the finished tutorial API for testing purposes, <a href="http://restframework.herokuapp.com/">available here</a>.</p>

<p>The API guide is your complete reference manual to all the functionality provided by REST framework.</p>
