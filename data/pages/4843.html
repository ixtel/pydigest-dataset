					<p>Lately, myself and a friend have become rather interested in learning more about machine learning. I’ve been trying to start a collection of learning materials that I either found useful or mean to go through at some point, and thought I’d write a post about it. I’m hoping this can help people who are just starting out and those who know more than me could comment and point me towards some additional material I can link to and look into myself.</p>
<p>**Update** Had a great response on Reddit, thanks so much for all the suggestions that have flooded in! I’ve added quite a few new links that looked good, and am currently reviewing some other materials I’ll link to soon. This list will continue to evolve with links to new content as I find them (or am alerted by others). <a href="https://twitter.com/Jack_Simpson" target="_blank">Follow me on Twitter</a> for updates and new posts on machine learning, research and statistics.</p>
