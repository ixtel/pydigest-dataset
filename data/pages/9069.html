<p>The usual coreference resolution works in the following way:</p>

<p>Provided</p>

<pre><code>The man likes math. He really does.
</code></pre>

<p>it figures out that </p>

<pre><code>he 
</code></pre>

<p>refers to </p>

<pre><code>the man.
</code></pre>

<p>There are plenty of tools to do this.</p>

<p>However, is there a way to do it backwards? </p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>given</p>

<pre><code>The man likes math. The man really does.
</code></pre>

<p>I want to do the pronoun resolution "backwards,"</p>

<p>so that I get an output like</p>

<pre><code>The man likes math. He really does.
</code></pre>

<p>My input text will mostly be 3~10 sentences, and I'm working with python.</p>
