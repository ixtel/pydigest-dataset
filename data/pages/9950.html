<h2>Django releases issued: 1.9.2 (security) and 1.8.9 (bugfix)</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on February 1, 2016 </span>

<p>In accordance with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/">our security release policy</a>, the Django team is issuing <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.9.2/">Django 1.9.2</a>. This release addresses a security issue detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch is also updated.</p>
<p>Today we've also issued a bugfix release for the 1.8 release series. Details can be found in the release notes for <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.8.9/">1.8.9</a>.</p>

<h3>CVE-2016-2048: User with "change" but not "add" permission can create objects for <tt class="docutils literal">ModelAdmin</tt>â€™s with <tt class="docutils literal">save_as=True</tt></h3>
<p>If a <tt class="docutils literal">ModelAdmin</tt> uses <tt class="docutils literal">save_as=True</tt> (not the default), the admin
provides an option when editing objects to "Save as new". A regression in
Django 1.9 prevented that form submission from raising a "Permission Denied"
error for users without the "add" permission.</p>
<p>Thanks Myk Willis for reporting the issue.</p>
