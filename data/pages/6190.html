<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on August 18, 2015 </span>

<p>In accordance with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/">our security release policy</a>, the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.22, 1.7.10, and 1.8.4. These releases are now available on PyPI and our download page. These releases address a security issue detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. The Django master branch has also been updated.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-denial-of-service-possibility-in-logout-view-by-filling-session-store">
<h3>Denial-of-service possibility in <tt class="docutils literal">logout()</tt> view by filling session store</h3>
<p>Previously, a session could be created when anonymously accessing the
<tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.views.logout</tt> view (provided it wasn't decorated
with <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required</tt> as done in the
admin). This could allow an attacker to easily create many new session records
by sending repeated requests, potentially filling up the session store or
causing other users' session records to be evicted.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware</tt> has been
modified to no longer create empty session records.</p>
<p>This portion of the fix has been assigned CVE-2015-5963.</p>
<p>Additionally, on the 1.4 and 1.7 series only, the
<tt class="docutils literal">contrib.sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.flush()</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">cache_db.SessionStore.flush()</tt> methods have been modified to avoid creating
a new empty session. Maintainers of third-party session backends should check
if the same vulnerability is present in their backend and correct it if so.</p>
<p>This portion of the fix has been assigned CVE-2015-5964. Anyone reporting a
similar vulnerability in a third-party session backend should not use this CVE ID.</p>
<p>Thanks Lin Hua Cheng for reporting the issue.</p>
