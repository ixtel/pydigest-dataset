					<h2>Job Description</h2>

										
					<p><strong>Join an early stage start-up building an international platform for genetic testing. Take a central role in a small team with flexible working hours and a central Cambridge office location. For the right candidate, there is the potential for stock options.</strong></p>
<h4>What is GeneAdviser?</h4>
<p>GeneAdviser is an online marketplace for genetic testing. Our mission is to make genetic testing more accessible for rare diseases, oncology, prenatal screening and precision medicine.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity to join a new business and grow with us as we reach into international markets. We are planning for rapid growth with a long term goal to create a genomic medicine portal, unifying the European genetic testing market.</p>
<p>The service is a dual-facing platform, with both clinicians and laboratories as our customers. Laboratories list available tests on our platform; clinicians search for and order those tests.</p>
<p>The beta version of our platform allows doctors to search for genetic tests, order and pay online. Our next version will handle secure patient data, allowing doctors to refer patients and receive results online in a HIPAA / HITECH compliant environment.</p>
<h4>What are we looking for?</h4>
<p>We’re looking for a developer to work alongside our CTO as we develop and improve the platform. You’ll be a core part of a small team, so we need motivated, creative, independent developers who are looking for a challenge and want to grow with us.</p>
<p>This post is ideal for someone with 2 to 5 years experience of web design and development who is interested in finding out more about the healthcare industry, and specifically about the fast-growing field of genomic medicine.</p>
<p>You will be joining fast-moving early stage start-up, building a complex search, ordering and payments platform. In particular, our next challenge is to build a secure platform to handle patient data in a HIPAA/HITECH compliant environment.</p>
