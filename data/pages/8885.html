                                <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Besides a king of fairies and a moon of Uranus (please post your jokes in the comments section), </p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(disambiguation)" target="_blank">Oberon</a><p> is also the name of a programming language in the Pascal/Modula tradition. Until 2008 Oberon was also the name of the runtime system but for practical reasons this was changed. The current system, A2, is a single-user, multi-core, multi-tasking system that runs on bare hardware or on top of a host operating system. 

</p><a href="http://www.projectoberon.com/" target="_blank">Project Oberon</a><p> is an open-source design for a complete desktop computer system from scratch. Its simplicity and clarity enables a single person to know and implement the entire system, while still providing enough power to make it useful and usable in a production environment. In 2013 Project Oberon was ported to a Digilent </p><a href="https://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?Prod=S3BOARD" target="_blank">Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA Starter Board</a><p> and later also to a </p><a href="http://saanlima.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=62&amp;product_id=51" target="_blank">Pipistrello board</a><p> from Saanlima. </p><a href="http://oberonstation.x10.mx/" target="_blank">OberonStation</a><p>, a Xilinx Spartan 3-based computer was designed specifically to run Oberon RISC.

<a href="http://www.astrobe.com/RISC5/" target="_blank">Astrobe for FPGA RISC5</a><p> is a free Windows (version 7, 8 and 10) development system that developers can use to edit and cross-compile applications written using the Oberon programming language to run either on an FPGA Project Oberon 2013 workstation and operating system or on an embedded real-time subset of the Project Oberon OS. The applications are uploaded to the host FPGA RISC5 target development board via a fast RS232 link to the PC.
