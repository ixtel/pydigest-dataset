            <h1 class="titleLines1">Java for Everything</h1>

            <p class="date">June 1, 2014</p>

<p>I used to ask interviewees, “What’s your favorite programming
language?” The answer was nearly always, “I just choose the right language
for the job.” Duh. Does anyone ever deliberately pick the wrong language? This
was clearly a way to avoid actually naming a language for fear of picking one I
didn’t like.</p>
<p>If the interviewee gave an answer at all, it was, “I’m most familiar with
language X,” which didn’t answer my question either.</p>
<p>At the time I would myself have replied something like, “I like Python best
because it makes me happy to program in it, but I only use it in such-and-such
a situation. The rest of the time I use XYZ…“</p>
<p>About a year ago, though, I started to form a strange idea: That Java is the
right language for <em>all</em> jobs. (I pause here while you vomit in your
mouth.) This rests on the argument that what you perceive to be true does not
match reality, and that’s never a popular approach, but let me explain anyway.</p>
<p>Python really is my favorite language, and it truly makes me happy when I code
in it. It pushes the happy spot in my head. It matches pseudo-code so well that
it’s a genuine pleasure to work in it.</p>
<p>Years ago I read Bruce Eckel’s influential <a href="https://docs.google.com/View?id=dcsvntt2_25wpjvbbhk">Strong Type vs. Strong
Testing</a>. In it he argued
that static typing (what he calls strong typing) is one of the many facets of
program correctness, and that if you’re going to check the other facets (such
as the algorithm and the logic) with unit tests, then the types will also get
checked, so you may as well go for dynamic typing and benefit from its
advantages.</p>
<p>Bruce used Python to illustrate his code, and that clinched it: I decided that
I would from then on write everything in Python.  Unfortunately I was half-way
through a large Java program at work, but my co-worker and I agreed that it
should have been written in Python, and perhaps one day we’d get a good excuse
to rewrite it all that way.</p>
<p>Several things changed my mind 180° in less than a year:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At one company I wrote a simulator that allowed me to run
    my Java services without a fully-functional site. In this
    simulator I ran scripts that tested various
    scenarios including failures. For these scripts
    I decided to use JavaScript,
    primarily because it’s included in Java 6 and secondarily
    because many people know it. I reasoned that a scripting
    language would allow us and Q/A to write tests easily.
    An intern, Justin Lebar, argued that we should simply
    use Java. The simulator is in Java, so why not write
    the scripts in it too? It’s sitting right there and
    we all know it. I went ahead with JavaScript, which forced
    me to write various code to bridge the two. It also
    meant that stack traces were much harder to read,
    since they didn’t point to the line in the script that
    was being executed. Q/A never wrote any tests.
    Overall we gained nothing from
    JavaScript and Justin had been right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same company we stored our logs in JSON format
    (which is a great idea, by the way), and a co-worker
    wrote a Python program called <code>logcat</code> to parse the
    logs and generate the standard columnar output,
    with many nice features and flag (including a binary
    search for timestamp). On OurGroceries, my personal
    project, we needed something similar and I suggested
    again to use Python. My partner Dan Collens suggested
    Java, since it’s right there and we know it and
    it’s fast. He wrote it and he was right: it’s blazing
    fast. I’ve since compared the Python logcat to a Java one
    and the latter is about ten times faster. Whatever
    time was saved by the developer when writing the Python code (if any)
    were lost many times over as dozens of users had
    to wait ten times longer each time they fished
    through the logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And finally, I went to write a simple program
    that put up a web interface. I considered using
    Python, but this would have required me to figure
    out how to serve pages from its library. I had
    already done this in Java (with Jetty), so I could
    be up and running in Java in less time. I realized
    that as I accumulate knowledge about 3rd party Java
    libraries and grow my own utility library, it
    becomes increasingly expensive to use any other
    language. I have to figure those things out again
    and write them again, instead of copying and
    pasting the code from the previous project. Note
    that this doesn’t argue for Java, but it does argue
    for using a single language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The big argument against Java is that it’s <em>verbose</em>.  Perhaps, but so
what? I suppose the real argument is that it takes longer to write the code. I
doubt this is very much true after the first 10 minutes.  Sure you have to
write <code>public static void main</code>, but how much time does that take? Sure you
have to write:</p>
<pre><code>Map&lt;String,User&gt; userIdMap = new HashMap&lt;String,User&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p>instead of:</p>
<pre><code>userIdMap = {}
</code></pre>
<p>but in the bigger scheme of things,
is that so long? How many total minutes out of a day
is that, two? And in Python the code more realistically
looks like this anyway:</p>
<pre><code># Map from user ID to User object.
userIdMap = {}
</code></pre>
<p>(If it doesn’t, then you have bigger problems. Undocumented Python programs are
horrendously difficult to maintain.) The problem is that programmers <em>perceive</em>
mindless work as painful and time-consuming, but the reality is never so bad.
Here’s a quote from a forum about language design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It really sucks when you have to add type declarations
for blindingly obvious things, e.g. Foo x = new Foo().
– <a href="http://alexgaynor.net/2010/nov/04/staticly-typed-language-id-actually-want-use/">@pazsxn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, actually, typing <code>Foo</code> one extra time does not “really suck”. It’s three
letters. The burden is massively overstated because the work is mindless, but
it’s really pretty trivial. Programmers will cringe at writing some kind of
command dispatch list:</p>
<pre><code>if command = "up":
    up()
elif command = "status":
    status()
elif command = "revert":
    revert()
...
</code></pre>
<p>so they’ll go off and write some introspecting auto-dispatch cleverness, but
that takes longer to write and will surely confuse future readers who’ll wonder
how the heck <code>revert()</code> ever gets called. Yet the programmer will incorrectly
feel as though he saved himself time. This is the trap of the dynamic language.
It feels like you’re being more productive, but aside from the first 10 minutes
of a new program, you’re not. Just write the stupid dispatch manually and get
on with the real work.</p>
<p><img alt="The General Problem" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png"/></p>
<p>(Aside: I’m on the wrong side of a different decision, the one to use vim for
code editing. I feel very efficient when using vim, as code flies around the
terminal, and I feel sluggish using Eclipse, and justify my choice with this
efficiency argument. But surely all my gains are lost the first time I have to
look up who calls a particular function, or when I have to look up the methods
of an object manually. I recognize that I’m wrong on this one in the same way
that dynamic language apologists are about their choice.)</p>
<p>So why are dynamic languages ever chosen? If you and I have a contest to write
a simple blogging system and you’re using (say) Python, you’ll have something
interesting in 30 minutes using pickling and whatnot, and it’ll take me two
days to build something with MySQL. Many language choices are based on trivial
contests like these. But after two weeks of development, when we both have to
add a feature, mine will take at most as long as yours, and I won’t be spending
any time figuring out how to get my system to handle so many users, or tracking
down why some obscure <code>if</code> clause breaks because you misspelled the name of a
function, or figuring out what the heck this <code>request</code> parameter contains.</p>

<p>And you don’t think you’ll struggle with scalability sooner than I?  Every year
the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> website goes down on October 31st.
It’s unresponsive for days. About 60,000 people hit it over a period of several
hours, so maybe four requests per second. It’s written in PHP. The OurGroceries
backend is written in Java. It handles (currently) about 50 complex requests
per second and the CPU rarely goes above 1% for the Java process.</p>
<p>Twitter recently <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/04/twitter-search-is-now-3x-faster_1656.html">tripled their search
speed</a>
by switching their search engine from Ruby to Java.</p>
<p>A year earlier, Joel Spolsky tweeted:</p>




<p>The reply from @GregB was:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&gt; <a href="https://twitter.com/spolsky">@spolsky</a>: Digg: 200MM page views, 500 servers. Stack Overflow: 60MM page views, 5 servers. What am I missing? &lt;&lt; That's the PHP factor</p>— Greg Brant (@GregB) <a href="https://twitter.com/GregB/statuses/27244912213">October 13, 2010</a></blockquote>



<p>StackOverflow uses ASP.NET. So you can complain all day about <code>public static
void main</code>, but have fun setting up 500 servers. The downsides of dynamic
languages are real, expensive, and permanent.</p>
<p>And what about the unit testing argument? If you have to unit test your code
anyway, what does static typing buy you? Well for one thing it buys you speed,
and lots of it.  But also writing and maintaining unit tests takes time.  Most
importantly, the kinds of bugs that people introduce most often aren’t the kind
of bugs that unit tests catch. With few exceptions (such as parsers), unit
tests are a waste of time.  To quote a friend of mine, “They’re a tedious,
error-prone way of trying to recapture the lost value of static type
annotations, but in a bumbling way in a separate place from the code itself.”</p>
<p>So here’s my new approach: <em>Do everything in Java</em>. Don’t be tempted to write
some quick hack in Python because:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can’t copy and paste code from other projects in
    your primary programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may feel faster to develop, but that’s an illusion.
    The actual time saved is small, though admittedly
    annoying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s one more language, platform, and set of libraries
    that I and my co-workers have to learn and master.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And here’s the important one: Chances are good that
    this quick hack will grow and become an important
    tool, and I won’t have the bandwidth to rewrite it,
    yet I’ll suffer the performance and maintenance
    penalty every time I use it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I <em>agree</em> it’s fun to develop in Python. I love it. When I’m writing a Sudoku
solver, I reach for Python. But it’s the wrong tool for anything larger, and
it’s the wrong tool for code of any size written for pay, because you’re doing
your employer a disservice.</p>
<p>I’m even taking this to an extreme and using Java for shell scripts. I’ve found
that anything other than a simple wrapper shell script eventually grows to the
point where I’m looking up the arcane syntax for removing some middle element
from an array in bash.  What a crappy language!  Wrong tool for the job! Write
it in Java to start with.  If shelling out to run commands is clumsy, write a
utility function to make it easy.</p>
<p>I’ve also written a <a href="https://github.com/lkesteloot/java_launcher"><code>java_launcher</code></a>
shell script that allows me to write this at the top of Java programs:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env java_launcher
# vim:ft=java
# lib:/home/lk/lib/teamten.jar
</code></pre>
<p>I can make the Java programs executable and drop the <code>.java</code> extension. The
script strips the header, compiles and caches the class file, and runs the
result with the specified jars. It provides one of the big advantages of
Python: the lack of build scripts for simple one-off programs.</p>
<p>This focus on a single language has had an interesting effect: It has
encouraged me to improve <a href="https://github.com/lkesteloot/teamten">my personal library of utility
functions</a> (teamten.jar above), since my
efforts are no longer split across several languages. For example, I wrote a
library that contains image processing routines.  They’re both faster <em>and</em>
higher quality than anything you can find in Java and Python. This took a
while, but I know it’s worth it because I won’t find myself writing some Python
script and wishing I could resize an image nicely. I can now confidently invest
in Java as an important part of my professional and personal technical future.</p>
<p>There remains the question of why choosing Java specifically, out of the set of
compiled statically-typed languages.  The advantages of C and C++ (slight
performance gains, embeddability, graphics libraries) don’t apply to my work.
C# is nice but not cross-platform enough. Scala is too complex.  And other
languages like D and Go are too new to bet my work on.</p>
<p>When I tell people that I now write everything in Java, they look horrified.
One friend had a visible look of disgust. But you know, Java’s a pretty nice
language, and when my code compiles, which is often the first time, it’ll
usually also run correctly. I don’t have that peace of mind with any other
language. Java just works like a horse and is useful across a very broad range
of applications.</p>
