I've been keeping an eye on RethinkDB for a while now and recently began working with it. There is a lot to like about RethinkDB like the ability to easily cluster and scale your deployment but what I'm going to focus on today is something called Changefeeds. I'll start this blog article off with installing a development server running RethinkDB and then move onto a quick tutorial. From there we will look at Changefeeds.<br/>

This post is the first in what I hope will be a series on neat things you can do with Morepath. Morepath is a Python web micro framework with some very interesting capabilities. What we'll look at today is what you can do with Morepath's link generation in a server-driven web application. While Morepath is an excellent fit to create REST APIs, it also works well server aplications. So let's look at how Morepath can help you to create a batching UI.<br/>
