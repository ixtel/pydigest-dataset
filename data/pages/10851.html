<p>I have umlauts/diaeresis and other special characters in my haystack (ä, ö, ü, é, è, ç, etc.). They seem to be indexed well, and are found if searched, as they are in the index.</p>

<p>Example: Searching for "Häberli" returns the all records containing it.</p>

<p><strong>What I want:</strong> Searching for "Haberli" should return all those records as well. I am currently using the <code>SearchQuerySet.auto_query()</code>. I didn't find any hints in the docs.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> Searching for "Haeberli" should return those as well.</p>

<p>I'm using django 1.8.5, haystack 2.4.1 and whoosh 2.7.0</p>
