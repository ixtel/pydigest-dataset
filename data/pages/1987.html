Seems almost obvious nowadays, but there was a time when no one believed it was even possible to create a decent spreadsheet application that would run in the browser. In particular, the ability to collaborate in realtime is a truly killer feature that opens the door to all kinds of interesting possibilities that involve sharing datasets and creating low-cost (read: makeshift) in-house tools such as dashboards and reports.</p><p name="b088" id="b088" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Everything today has an API, which makes it an incredible time to be a programmer. At your fingertips, theoretically, is the ability to automate, orchestrate, synchronize data of all sorts into containers and formats of all sorts.</p><p name="7942" id="7942" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Reality is, however, that this theoretically simple process is often quite gruesome. Often times trying to pull some data off an API involves trying to piece together a complete picture of how a service works from very fragmented documentation. Being mainstream as it is, I was surprised at how missing the documentation for Spreadsheets API is. To help get you started, I’ve put some demo code on github along with some helper functions I wrote to do some common tasks. The installation script will guide you through the red-tape on Google’s side.</p><p name="9303" id="9303" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Hope you find it useful, you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/rotemtam/google-spreadsheet-python-example" data-href="https://github.com/rotemtam/google-spreadsheet-python-example" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rotemtam/google-spreadsheet-python-example</a></p><p name="c70e" id="c70e" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">Feel free to contact me on twitter @rotemtam if you need any help.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
