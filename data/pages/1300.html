            <pre class="post-content-full" itemprop="text">What would you think if a government employee was president of a company and granted it benefits? Would that be illegal?

In previous research showed a network of employers and employees who have Puerto Rican government is using its influence to profit illegally (http://www.anonyme.com/View/1b38a76e-3591-4206-8791-3587cdeb9e17)

This time we present the behavior of a local company whose name continues to appear in the local media and is raised as an example of entrepreneurship, its founders, as heroes of the local economy and role models, "growth hackers" as they have been exalted by the same CIO of Puerto Rico Giancarlos Gonzalez, we refer to the company Blimp.

Blimp was founded by Ivan Rios and Giovanni Collazo (https://prcorpfiling.f1hst.com/CorrespondenceHandler.ashx?WGUID=614026e8-0d0c-4011-b7c6-abfc8f276bf7&amp;SEQ=504372&amp;IE=0) with José Padilla as co-founder (https://geekli.st/jpadilla), as is clear from the records of the State Department.  The document details Ivan Rios a one of the authorized persons whose duties do not end with the presentation of the organization. In this case Ivan Rios was a lawyer, administrator and authorized person.

Shortly after being founded Ivan Rios was appointed as Director of Science and Technology Trust, an agency that has been in the past under investigation and scrutiny by the Senate of Puerto Rico itself. Reviewing the State Department documents, you can see that there have been no amendments to the administrative structure of Blimp, indicating that Ivan Rios remains the co-administrator of the same along with Giovanni Collazo. A quick scrutiny of the activities of the Science and Technology Trust shown as government agency that has been supporting the company since its founding Blimp with benefits and free up office space even when denied the same benefits other local businesses with greater potential .

How does Blimp conduct their activities without being scrutinized by the community in general? As in other cases already mentioned, Blimp is aided by a national newspaper and at least one of its reporters, Marie Custodio Collazo, who like reporter Laura Quintero often distort the facts, whether through ignorance or design, to show favorably or as victims the companies they are sheltering.

How can it be possible that a single reporter can use the resources of national newspapers, Nuevo Día and Primera Hora as if they were their property to benefit Blimp and its members? Is the management of the New Day "up to date" of these actions? If they are, why the continuous behavior?

Do you still think that any of this is wrong?

Apparently the founding members of Blimp and the press think not, because as if this were not enough in recent times then management of Blimp, not happy with the money and benefits obtained illegally, have started to make a series of paid workshops using the facilities of the  Science  and Technology Trust, the first of these called Building for the Web (http://www.killerrabbitlabs.com/building-for-the-web-lessons-learned/).

Do the poeple attending these events know they are participating in a corruption scheme? Do the people who support this company know that is a lawsuit, whether civil or criminal, were to be filed, the will be involved in legal proceedings as witnesses.

This is not the first time the Science and  Technology Trust and Ivan Rios have been under fire from other government agencies for their poor performance and behaviour:

How is it possible that the Science and Technology Trust receives $ 20 million dollars annually with this track record? How Ivan Rios continues at the head of it? Why Blimp, Giovanni Collazo and Jose Padilla  continue inpune?</pre>
