					<h2>Job Description</h2>

										
					<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>Where is your electricity coming from right now? Sometimes it’s fossil fuels, other times it’s renewables—and <a href="http://watttime.org" target="_blank">WattTime</a> can tell you which. WattTime is a nonprofit startup that’s fighting climate change by making it easy to use energy when it’s cleanest. The first “WattTime-enabled” product, the JuiceBox Green, is the one and only clean electric vehicle charging station.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p>
<p>As WattTime’s first full-time software engineer, you’ll help us extend and scale our platform to support our next wave of partners: smart thermostats and smart buildings! You’ll start with our well-tested Python platform that connects real-time electricity grid data to IoT devices. You’ll get to work across the stack: from optimizing the backend with Postgres, Celery, and Pandas, to crafting customer-facing features with Django Rest Framework and your favorite front-end tools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you bring:</strong></p>
<p>A few years of on-the-job experience with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rapid and robust software engineering, particularly Python/Django</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database design and management, particularly time-series data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud hosting and devops, particularly Heroku or AWS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-centered product development, particularly API/platform products</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Bonus points if you also like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Front-end design and development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machine learning and optimization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open source community building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cleantech, renewable energy, building automation, IoT</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you believe:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I’m pragmatic: I like to focus on building the things that make this product unique, and I prefer to use existing high-quality tools/services/packages for the rest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m flexible: I enjoy pitching in, and I’m not fazed when the plan changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m an engineer: Whether prototype or production, I feel good about my work when it’s reliable, transparent, repurposable, and able to withstand the pressures I’ve anticipated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m passionate: For my next position, I’ll choose a big impact over a big payout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m collaborative: I’m excited to join a team of nice folks and help our partners succeed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you’ll get:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The chance to build software that can make a huge difference for climate change!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A valued role on our small distributed team of dedicated, energetic cleantechies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close collaboration with the CTO and influence on technical direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fantastic brand-new office space near BART in downtown Oakland, or near the Red Line in downtown Boston</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitive compensation, health insurance, and flexible hours</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The logistics:</strong></p>
<p>This is a full-time position, negotiable as a 6-month contract or regular hire. We prefer candidates based in the Bay Area, Boston, Seattle, or Chicago. Members of underrepresented groups, including people of color, women, and/or LGBT, are strongly welcomed! Contact Anna with any questions.</p>
