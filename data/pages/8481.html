<p>Holocron is an extendable static blog generator powered by the Force. Like
others, it reads text files in various formats, renders them using templates
and produces a ready-to-publish static website which could be served by
Nginx or another web server. Unlike others, it tries to retrieve as many
information as possible from the filesystem. Its core follows the KISS
principle and any wheel reinventions were avoided during the process.</p>
<p>Feel the Force? Then use Holocron!</p>
