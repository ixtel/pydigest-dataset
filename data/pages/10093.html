<p>There are three goals for this project.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a C API to CPython for plugging in a JIT</li>
<li>Develop a JIT module using <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr">CoreCLR</a> utilizing the C API mentioned in goal #1</li>
<li>Develop a C++ framework that any JIT targetting the API in goal #1 can use to make development easier</li>
</ol>

<p>Goal #1 is to make it so that CPython have a JIT plugged in as desired (CPython
is the Python implementation you download from <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>). That
would allow for an ecosystem of JIT implementations for Python where users can
choose the JIT that works best for their use-case. And by using CPython we hope
to have compatibility with all code that it can run (both Python code as well
as C extension modules).</p>

<p>Goal #2 is to develop a JIT for CPython using the JIT provided by the
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr">CoreCLR</a>. It's cross-platform, liberally
licensed, and the original creator of Pyjion has a lot of experience with it.</p>

<p>Goal #3 is to abstract out all of the common bits required to write a JIT
implementation for CPython. The idea is to create a framework where JIT
implementations only have to worry about JIT-specific stuff like <em>how</em> to do
addition and not <em>when</em> to do addition.</p>

<p>Like the word "pigeon". @DinoV wanted a name that had something with "Python"
-- the "Py" part -- and something with "JIT" -- the "JI" part -- and have it be
pronounceable.</p>

<p><a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> is an implementation of Python with its own JIT. The
biggest difference compared to Pyjion is that PyPy doesn't support C extension
modules without modification unless they use <a href="https://cffi.readthedocs.org">CFFI</a>.
Pyjion also aims to support many JIT compilers while PyPy only supports their
own custom JIT compiler.</p>



<p><a href="http://pyston.org">Pyston</a> is an implementation of Python using
<a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> as a JIT compiler. Compared to Pyjion, Pyston has
partial CPython C API support but not complete support. Pyston also only
supports LLVM as a JIT compiler.</p>



<p><a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> is a JIT compiler for "array-oriented and
math-heavy Python code". This means that Numba is focused on scientific
computing while Pyjion tries to optimize all Python code. Numba also only
supports LLVM.</p>



<p><a href="http://ironpython.net/">IronPython</a> is an implementation of Python that is
implemented using <a href="http://microsoft.com/NET">.NET</a>. While IronPython tries to
be usable from within .NET, Pyjion does not have an compatibility with .NET.
This also means IronPython cannot use C extension modules while Pyjion can.</p>



<p><a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net/">Psyco</a> was a module that monkeypatched CPython
to add a custom JIT compiler. Pyjion wants to introduce a proper C API for
adding a JIT compiler to CPython instead of monkeypatching it. It should be
noted the creator of Psyco went on to be one of the co-founders of PyPy.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unladen_Swallow">Unladen Swallow</a> was an attempt
to make LLVM be a JIT compiler for CPython. Unfortunately the project lost
funding before finishing their work after having to spend a large amount of
time fixing issues in LLVM's JIT compiler (which has greatly improved over the
subsequent years).</p>

<p>Yes! Goals #1 and #3 are entirely platform-agnostic while goal #2 of using
CoreCLR as a JIT compiler is not an impedence to supporting OS X or Linux as
it already supports the major OSs. The only reason Pyjion doesn't directly
support Linux or OS X is entirely momentum/laziness: since the work is being
driven by Microsoft employees, it simply meant it was easier to get going on
Windows.</p>

<p>Goal #1 is explicitly to add a C API to CPython to support JIT compilers. There
is no expectation, though, to ship a JIT compiler with CPython. This is because
CPython compiles with nothing more than a C89 compiler, which allows it to run
on many platforms. But adding a JIT compiler to CPython would immediately limit
it to only the platforms that the JIT supports.</p>
