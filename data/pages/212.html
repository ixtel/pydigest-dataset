<div id="upgrading-from-distribute">

<p>Currently, Distribute disallows installing Setuptools 0.7+ over Distribute.
You must first uninstall any active version of Distribute first (see
<a href="#uninstalling" rel="nofollow">Uninstalling</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="windows">

<p>The recommended way to install setuptools on Windows is to download
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py" rel="nofollow">ez_setup.py</a> and run it. The script will download the appropriate .egg
file and install it for you.</p>
<p>For best results, uninstall previous versions FIRST (see <a href="#uninstalling" rel="nofollow">Uninstalling</a>).</p>
<p>Once installation is complete, you will find an <tt>easy_install</tt> program in
your Python <tt>Scripts</tt> subdirectory.  For simple invocation and best results,
add this directory to your <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable, if it is not already
present.</p>

<div id="unix-based-systems-including-mac-os-x">

<p>Download <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py" rel="nofollow">ez_setup.py</a> and run it using the target Python version. The script
will download the appropriate version and install it for you:</p>
<pre>&gt; wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | python
</pre>
<p>Note that you will may need to invoke the command with superuser privileges to
install to the system Python:</p>
<pre>&gt; wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, on Python 2.6 and later, Setuptools may be installed to a
user-local path:</p>
<pre>&gt; wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
&gt; python ez_setup.py --user
</pre>
</div>

<div id="advanced-installation">

<p>For more advanced installation options, such as installing to custom
locations or prefixes, download and extract the source
tarball from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools" rel="nofollow">Setuptools on PyPI</a>
and run setup.py with any supported distutils and Setuptools options.
For example:</p>
<pre>setuptools-x.x$ python setup.py --prefix=/opt/setuptools
</pre>
<p>Use <tt><span class="pre">--help</span></tt> to get a full options list, but we recommend consulting
the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/EasyInstall" rel="nofollow">EasyInstall manual</a> for detailed instructions, especially <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/EasyInstall#custom-installation-locations" rel="nofollow">the section
on custom installation locations</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="uninstalling">

<p>On Windows, if Setuptools was installed using an <tt>.exe</tt> or <tt>.msi</tt>
installer, simply use the uninstall feature of “Add/Remove Programs” in the
Control Panel.</p>
<p>Otherwise, to uninstall Setuptools or Distribute, regardless of the Python
version, delete all <tt>setuptools*</tt> and <tt>distribute*</tt> files and
directories from your system’s <tt><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> directory
(and any other <tt>sys.path</tt> directories) FIRST.</p>
<p>If you are upgrading or otherwise plan to re-install Setuptools or Distribute,
nothing further needs to be done. If you want to completely remove Setuptools,
you may also want to remove the ‘easy_install’ and ‘easy_install-x.x’ scripts
and associated executables installed to the Python scripts directory.</p>
