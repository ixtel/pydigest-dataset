	<p>The internet is paving the way for a small teaching revolution.
As a teaching community we can now share our lesson plans, materials, and
experiences with the whole world. We can use other’s resources as a foundation to
build our own courses so that we iterate towards ever better learning materials.
This process is only just beginning, so to help we’ve put
together a list below of some of the best Python teaching resources
available. If you’re teaching a Python class, hopefully these can save you time and
effort that you can instead invest into 
delivering the best course possible!</p>

<p>Most resources below have an open source license permitting their use and
modification anywhere (with attribution to the original source). If we’re missing
anything that you think we should feature, please let us know.</p>

<p>The Software Carpentry lessons are aimed at students with limited programming experience
and introduce Python through real-world examples, even from the first lesson.
Rather than diving straight into syntax and details, the Software Carpentry lessons also explain
abstract concepts like variables, loops and if statements.
All lessons are motivation by real-world examples of scientific workflows, and the
lessons work through analyzing some example CSV data sets as a context for introducing
different aspect of Python.</p>

<p>Notably the Software Carpentry lessons focus on best practices and reproducible workflows.
Topics like error handling, defensive programming and how to structure code are covered
rather than moving onto more advanced Python concepts as other lessons typically do.</p>

<p>The Software Carpentry lessons are split into 10 sections of varying length which would
take around 2 whole days to cover completely. The lectures are structured as Jupyter
notebooks, with a blank instructor version available for live coding.
Exercises are provided at the end of each section.</p>

<p><em>Lectures on scientific computing with Python</em>
provides a broad overview of the scientific computing landscape with Python,
including most of the standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib and sympy),
as well as discussing topics like reproducibility, replication and version control.</p>

<p>Focus is mostly on syntax, features and providing a comprehensive overview of what
is possible in Python and the scientific libraries. For students with existing
programming experience, this would be a comprehensive introduction to what is possible
with Python, but it may move too quickly for an initial introduction to programming.</p>

<p>Each lecture is presented as a Jupyter notebook. After a lecture introducing
Python and scientific computing in general, there is a lecture focused on each
scientific library.</p>

<p><em>12 steps to Navier-Stokes</em> is a complete course in numerically solving differential equations using Python.
Taught in the context of fluid dynamics,
starting with simple one dimensional equations, and ending with a numerical solver
for the Navier-Stokes equation.
The focus is on the numerical methods and set up, but plenty of attention is paid to explaining what is happening in the Python code as well.</p>

<p>May be a little too much for students who have never programmed before, but students with prior programming experience will pick up the Python as they go. Functions and features of the Python programming language are explained as they are first used.</p>

<p><em>Quantitative Economics</em> is a complete series of lectures. It it split into three parts:
The first part introduces Python and the standard scientific libraries (numpy, matplotlib,
scipy, pandas). The latter parts focus on quantitative economics topics with Python
used for code examples and exercises.</p>

<p>The lectures starts right at the beginning with how to install and set up Python. 
The Python focus is mostly on syntax, features and providing a comprehensive overview of what
is possible in Python and the scientific libraries. For students with existing
programming experience, this would be a comprehensive introduction to what is possible
with Python, but it may move too quickly for an initial introduction to programming.</p>

<p>There are exercises at the end of many of the sections, and full solutions in accompanying
Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<p><em>[Ed: I don’t have the background to evaluate in detail the quantitive economics part of this book.
Comments welcome]</em></p>

<p><em>Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Data Analysis</em> is a comprehensive textbook
introducing Python for use in a scientific context. While the title suggests a focus on Econometrics,
most of the material would be appropriate for general usage.</p>

<p>This is not a ready-to-teach course, but be a suitable textbook to develop a course
from. There are many exercises to pick from, and the range of topics is large.</p>

<p><em>Programming for Biologists</em> provides an introduction to Python as a language,
and some of the libraries and tools that will be useful to biologists, including
numpy, plotting with matplotlib, interacting with databases and read/writing
text files.</p>

<p>Each topic is presented as a short Jupyter notebook. The first notebook dives straight
into python syntax, so set up and introduction to Python will have to come from
elsewhere. Each topic is clear and to the point. If the students are already
familiar with abstract programming concepts then these notes will provide a 
quick and clear introduction to Python and some of its use-cases.</p>

<p><em>Introduction to Data Processing with Python</em> provides a simple introduction to
reading data from text and csv files, manipulating this data and then plotting
histograms using matplotlib.</p>

<p>The lesson materials contain lots of questions with solutions available to the instructor.
The questions are paced appropriately and should help to keep the students engaged with
the lessons throughout.</p>

<p>Familiarity with Python is assumed, and the Open Tech School’s
<em><a href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html">Introduction to Programming with Python</a></em>
course is recommended as a prerequisite if students need it.</p>

<p><em>Introduction to data visualization in Python</em> is a short workshop aimed at students working
with map based data (typically stored in the NetCDF format). Topics covered are: simple plotting
with matplotlib, reading data from NetCDF files and plotting map based data using basemap.
Each topic is a separate Jupyter notebook.</p>

<p>Contains lots of examples and useful standalone snippets of Python, but a basic understanding
of Python will be needed by students if they are to follow along.</p>

<p>A collection of many problems and exercises for students in bioinformatics.
This resource is a bit different since it’s not a course that can be taught as-is,
but it provides a wide range of real-world bioinformatics questions that could be 
included in a course.</p>
