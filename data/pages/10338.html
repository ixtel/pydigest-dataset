<p>Hello Pythoneers!</p> 
<p>CJ will lead tonight's talk with exploration of Python's <b>metaclasses and magic methods</b>.  </p> 
<p>NEW LOCATION: Our meetup is located at the <strong>Black Labrador Pub</strong>, near Richmond and Montrose. Please enjoy their menu and drink offerings, so they continue to enjoy hosting us! Lastly, <strong>please RSVP</strong> (even if you're a "Maybe"!) to assist us with capacity planning.</p> 
<p><strong>Share your Lightning Talks!</strong> A "lightning talk" is a quick mini-presentation (5 minutes maximum) on any Python topic you'd like.  We'll save time for 2-3 of these each month: to save a spot, post a comment with your talk's title/topic. Beginner topics are always welcome!</p>
