I've been programming all my life, but never been </p><em>a</em><p> programmer. Most of my work was done in Visual Basic because it's what I was most comfortable with, plus a smattering of other languages (R, C, JavaScript, etc... Pascal, Applescript, Hypertext and BASIC, which I learned in 1979, if you go far back enough). A couple of years ago, I decided to use Python exclusively so that I could improve my coding. I ended up re-inventing many wheels -- which I didn't mind too much, because I enjoy solving puzzles. But sometimes it's good to have a more efficient, Pythonesque approach, and time after time I found myself having "aha!" moments, realizing I'd been doing things the hard, excessively verbose way for no reason. Here is a list of ten Python idioms that would have made my life much easier if I'd thought to search for them early on.
</p><p>
Missing from this list are some idioms such as list comprehensions and lambda functions, which are very Pythonesque and very efficient and very cool, but also very difficult to miss because they're mentioned on StackOverflow every other answer! Also ternary x if y else z constructions, decorators and generators, because I don't use them very often.
