<p>One of the really nice things about Django is that it ships with a fantastic
ORM, user authentication, and admin panel.  These three things make building
secure Django websites incredibly easy, and generally make Django sites more
secure than their counterparts.</p>

<p>This is why I’m super excited to announce that as of very recently,
<a href="https://stormpath.com/" title="Stormpath">Stormpath</a> officially supports Django &gt;:)</p>

<p>Our new <a href="https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-django" title="django-stormpath on Github">django-stormpath</a> library allows you to keep using all of the normal
Django auth system stuff, while completely handling all scaling and security
issues.</p>




<p>If you’re not already familiar with Stormpath, what we do is really quite
simple: <em>we store user accounts for your application</em>.  We do one thing, and we
do it well.</p>

<p>Our service will store your users, handle all the password hashing and security,
and provide wrappers around common bits of functionality like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Handling permissions.</li>
<li>Storing user data.</li>
<li>Authenticating users and API requests.</li>
<li>Handling social login with Google, Facebook, etc.</li>
<li>Scaling out your user system.</li>
<li>Providing wrappers in many languages so you can access your users via a
central location instead of directly connecting to a database / etc.
regardless of what languages / tools you’re using.</li>
</ul>


<p>So — with that said, what makes our new Django library awesome is this: if
you want a managed service for storing / accessing user data, Stormpath makes
things super easy.</p>

<h2>Using django-stormpath</h2>

<p>The way you use our new <a href="https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-django" title="django-stormpath on Github">django-stormpath</a> library is pretty simple.</p>

<p>Firstly, you need to install the library using <a href="http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/" title="pip">pip</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ pip install django-stormpath
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you’ll need to add a few settings in your <code>settings.py</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    'django_stormpath',
)

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'django_stormpath.backends.StormpathBackend',
)

AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'django_stormpath.StormpathUser'

# Your Stormpath credentials, these can be retrieved from your dashboard.
# If you don't have an account, go make one!  https://api.stormpath.com/register
STORMPATH_ID = 'xxx'
STORMPATH_SECRET = 'xxx'
STORMPATH_APPLICATION = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/xxx'
</code></pre>

<p>The settings above are <em>all you need</em> to get things working.</p>

<p>Once you add in the settings above, your Django site will start magically
working with Stormpath.  The way things work is pretty cool:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a new user is created, they’ll be created in both Stormpath <em>and</em> your
local Django database.</li>
<li>When a user is authenticated, if the user exists in Stormpath, they’ll be
authenticated by us.  If the user exists in your local Django database,
that’ll be used as the fall-back.</li>
</ul>


<p>Not bad, right?</p>

<h2>Hosted Login / SSO</h2>

<p>In addition to using Stormpath for your Django user storage — you can also use
Stormpath’s hosted login pages if you’d like.</p>

<p>The way this works is also pretty cool:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable “ID Site” functionality in <a href="https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-django" title="django-stormpath on Github">django-stormpath</a>.</li>
<li>When a user wants to log in, you redirect them to a hosted domain like
(<code>login.yoursite.com</code>) — which Stormpath hosts for you.</li>
<li>Stormpath will let the person log in or create an account on your site.</li>
<li>Stormpath will redirect the authenticated user back to your webapp
(<code>yoursite.com/dashboard</code> or whatever).</li>
<li>BAM! You have an authenticated user and pre-built login / registration /
password reset / social login pages.</li>
</ul>


<p>To learn more about this, check out the <a href="https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-django#id-site" title="django-stormpath Hosted Login">relevant docs</a>.</p>

<p>I really like the hosted login stuff as it makes building single-sign-on
applications super easy.</p>
