<h2>Call for nominations for the 2015 Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial Prize</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Ola Sitarska and Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on September 29, 2015 </span>

<p>Two years ago, the <a class="reference external" href="https://djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a> established an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/sep/16/announcing-malcolm-tredinnick-memorial-prize/">award in the memory of Malcolm Tredinnick</a>.</p>
<p>Malcolm joined the Django core team in 2006, and many of Django's internals - including the ORM, unicode support, and template autoescaping - bear his fingerprints. Malcolm was also a prolific communicator, logging thousands of messages in <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/django-users">django-users</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/django-developers">django-developers</a>, helping people learn Django, sharing his expertise freely and openly, and helping to shape the framework we know and love today.  Malcolm <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/mar/19/goodbye-malcolm/">passed away</a> suddenly on March 17, 2013. He is deeply missed by all who knew him.</p>
<p>The Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial prize is a monetary prize, awarded annually, given to the person who best exemplifies the spirit of Malcolm’s work - someone who welcomes, supports and nurtures newcomers; who freely gives feedback and assistance to others, and helps to grow the community. The hope is that the recipient of the award will use the award stipend as a contribution to travel to a community event -- a DjangoCon, a PyCon, a sprint -- and continue in Malcolm’s footsteps.</p>
<p>Last year, the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/oct/11/dsf-announces-winner-2014-malcolm-tredinnick-memor/">winner of the Malcolm Tredinnick Memorial Prize was the Django Girls organization</a>. The DSF is now calling for nominees for this year's award recipient. The DSF board will accept nominations from anyone in the community. The board will narrow that list down to a short list, and put that short list to the DSF membership for a final vote. If you would like to nominate someone for the award, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:foundation@djangoproject.com">get in touch</a>. Nominations will remain open until October 14; we announce the winner at the end of October.</p>
<p>We hope you'll join us in lighting a candle in Malcolm’s memory.</p>
