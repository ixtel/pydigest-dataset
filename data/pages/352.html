In the previous post I effectively rounded out the discussion on the implementation of the decorator pattern, or at least the key parts that I care to cover at this point. I may expand on a few other things that can be done at a later time.
</p><p>
At this point I want to start looking at ways this decorator pattern can be used to implement better decorators. For this post I want to look at the @synchronized decorator.
</p><p>
The concept of the @synchronized decorator originates from Java and the idea of being able to write such a decorator in Python was a bit of a poster child when decorators were first added to Python. Despite this, there is no standard @synchronized decorator in the Python standard library. If this was such a good example of why decorators are so useful, why is this the case?

</p><h3>
Stealing ideas from the Java language</h3>
<p>
The equivalent synchronization primitive from Java comes in two forms. These are </p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/syncmeth.html">synchronized methods</a><p> and </p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/locksync.html">synchronized statements</a><p>.
</p><p>
In Java, to make a method synchronized, you simply add the synchronized keyword to its declaration:
</p><blockquote>
public class SynchronizedCounter {<br/>
    private int c = 0; </blockquote>
<blockquote>
    public synchronized void increment() {<br/>
        c++;<br/>
    } </blockquote>
<blockquote>
    public synchronized void decrement() {<br/>
        c--;<br/>
    } </blockquote>
<blockquote>
    public synchronized int value() {<br/>
        return c;<br/>
    }<br/>
}</blockquote><p>
Making a method synchronized means it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object to interleave. When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.
</p><p>
In other words, each instance of the class has an intrinsic lock object and upon entering a method the lock is being acquired, with it subsequently being released when the method returns. The lock is what is called a re-entrant lock, meaning that a thread can while it holds the lock, acquire it again without blocking. This is so that from one synchronized method it is possible to call another synchronized method on the same object.
</p><p>
The second way to create synchronized code in Java is with synchronized statements. Unlike synchronized methods, synchronized statements must specify the object that provides the intrinsic lock:
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
public void addName(String name) {<br/>
    synchronized(this) {<br/>
        lastName = name;<br/>
        nameCount++;<br/>
    }<br/>
    nameList.add(name);<br/>
}</blockquote><p>
Of note is that in Java one can use any object as the source of the lock, it is not necessary to create an instance of a specific lock type to synchronize on. If more fined grained locking is required within a class one can simply create or use an existing arbitrary object to synchronize on.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
public class MsLunch {<br/>
    private long c1 = 0;<br/>
    private long c2 = 0;<br/>
    private Object lock1 = new Object();<br/>
    private Object lock2 = new Object(); </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    public void inc1() {<br/>
        synchronized(lock1) {<br/>
            c1++;<br/>
        }<br/>
    } </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    public void inc2() {<br/>
        synchronized(lock2) {<br/>
            c2++;<br/>
        }<br/>
    }<br/>
}</blockquote><p>
These synchronization primitives looks relatively simple to use, so how close did people come to actually achieving the level of simplicity by using decorators to do the same in Python.

</p><h3>
Synchronizing off a thread mutex</h3>
<p>
In Python it isn't possible to synchronize off an arbitrary object. Instead it is necessary to create a specific lock object which internally holds a thread mutex. Such a lock object provides an acquire() and release() method for manipulating the lock.
</p><p>
Since context managers were introduced to Python however, locks also support being used in conjunction with the 'with' statement. Using this specific feature, the typical recipe given for implementing a @synchronized decorator for Python is:
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
def synchronized(lock=None):<br/>
    def _decorator(wrapped):<br/>
        @functools.wraps(wrapped)<br/>
        def _wrapper(*args, **kwargs):<br/>
            with lock:<br/>
                return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)<br/>
        return _wrapper<br/>
    return _decorator </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
lock = threading.RLock() </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized(lock)<br/>
def function():<br/>
    pass</blockquote><p>
Using this approach becomes annoying after a while because for every distinct function that needs to be synchronized, you have to first create a companion thread lock to go with it.
</p><p>
The alternative to needing to pass in the lock object each time, is to create one automatically for each use of the decorator.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
def synchronized(wrapped):<br/>
    lock = threading.RLock() </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @functools.wraps(wrapped)<br/>
    def _wrapper(*args, **kwargs):<br/>
        with lock:<br/>
            return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)<br/>
    return _wrapper </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized<br/>
def function():<br/>
    pass</blockquote><p>
We can even use the pattern described previously for allowing optional decorator arguments to permit either approach.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
def synchronized(wrapped=None, lock=None):<br/>
    if wrapped is None:<br/>
        return functools.partial(synchronized, lock=lock) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    if lock is None:<br/>
        lock = threading.RLock() </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @functools.wraps(wrapped)<br/>
    def _wrapper(*args, **kwargs):<br/>
        with lock:<br/>
            return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)<br/>
    return _wrapper </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized<br/>
def function1():<br/>
    pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
lock = threading.Lock() </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized(lock=lock)<br/>
def function2():<br/>
    pass</blockquote><p>
Whatever the approach, the decorator being based on a function closure suffers all the problems we have already outlined. The first step we can therefore take is to update it to use our new decorator factory instead.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
def synchronized(wrapped=None, lock=None):<br/>
    if wrapped is None:<br/>
        return functools.partial(synchronized, lock=lock) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    if lock is None:<br/>
        lock = threading.RLock() </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @decorator<br/>
    def _wrapper(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):<br/>
        with lock:<br/>
            return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)<br/>
    return _wrapper(wrapped)</blockquote><p>
Because this is using our decorator factory, it also means that the same code is safe to use on instance, class or static methods as well.
</p><p>
Using this on methods of a class though starts to highlight why this simplistic approach isn't particularly useful. This is because the locking only applies to calls made to the specific method which is wrapped. Plus that it will be across that one method on all instances of the class. This isn't really want we want and doesn't mirror how synchronized methods in Java work.
</p><p>
Reiterating what we are after again, for all instance methods of a specific instance of a class, if they have been decorated as being synchronized, we want them to synchronize off a single lock object associated with the class instance.
</p><p>
Now there have been posts describing how to improve on this in the past, including for example </p><a href="http://theorangeduck.com/page/synchronized-python">this</a><p> quite involved attempt. Personally though I find the way in which it is done is quite clumsy and even suspect it isn't actually thread safe, with a race condition over the creation of some of the locks.
</p><p>
Because it used function closures and didn't have our concept of a universal decorator, it was also necessary to create a multitude of different decorators and then try and plaster them together under a single decorator entry point. Obviously, we should now be able to do a lot better than this.

</p><h3>
Storing the thread mutex on objects</h3>
<p>
Starting over, lets take a fresh look at how we can manage the thread locks we need to have. Rather than requiring the lock be passed in, or creating it within a function closure which is then available to the nested wrapper, lets try and manage the locks within the wrapper itself.
</p><p>
In doing this the issue is where can we store the thread lock. The only options for storing any data between invocations of the wrapper are going to be on the wrapper itself, on the wrapped function object, in the case of wrapping an instance method, on the class instance, or for a class method, on the class.
</p><p>
Lets first consider the case of a normal function. In that case what we can do is store the required thread lock on the wrapped function object itself.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
@decorator<br/>
def synchronized(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):<br/>
    lock = vars(wrapped).get('_synchronized_lock', None) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    if lock is None:<br/>
        lock = vars(wrapped).setdefault('_synchronized_lock', threading.RLock()) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    with lock:<br/>
        return wrapped(*args, **kwargs) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized<br/>
def function():<br/>
    pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&gt;&gt;&gt; function() </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&gt;&gt;&gt; function._synchronized_lock<br/>
&lt;_RLock owner=None count=0&gt;</blockquote><p>
A key issue we have to deal with in doing this is how to create the thread lock the first time it is required. To do that the first thing we need do is to see if we already have created a thread lock.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
lock = vars(wrapped).get('_synchronized_lock', None)</blockquote><p>
If this returns a valid thread lock object we are fine and can continue on to attempt to acquire the lock. If however it didn't exist we need to create it, but we have to be careful how we do this in order to avoid a race condition when two threads have entered this section of code at the same time and both believe it is responsible for creating the thread lock.
</p><p>
The trick we use to solve this is to use:
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
lock = vars(wrapped).setdefault('_synchronized_lock', threading.RLock())</blockquote><p>
In the case of two threads trying to set the lock at the same time, they will both actually create an instance of a thread lock, but by virtue of using dict.setdefault(), only one of them will win and actually be able to set it to the instance of the thread lock it created.
</p><p>
As dict.setdefault() then returns whichever is the first value to be stored, both threads will then continue on and attempt to acquire the same thread lock object. It doesn't matter here that one of the thread objects gets thrown away as it will only occur at the time of initialisation and only if there was actually a race to set it.
</p><p>
We have therefore managed to replicate what we had originally, the difference though being that the thread lock is stored on the wrapped function, rather than on the stack of an enclosing function. We still have the issue that every instance method will have a distinct lock.
</p><p>
The simple solution is that we use the fact that this is what we are calling a universal decorator and use the ability to detect in what context the decorator was used.
</p><p>
Specifically, what we want to do is detect when we are being used on an instance method or class method, and store the lock on the object passed as the 'instance' argument instead.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">

&gt;&gt;&gt; id(o1._synchronized_lock)<br/>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&gt;&gt;&gt; o2.method_im()<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; o2._synchronized_lock<br/>
&lt;_RLock owner=None count=0&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(o2._synchronized_lock)<br/>
4386605456</blockquote><p>
This simple change has actually achieved the result we desired. If the synchronized decorator is used on a normal function then the thread lock will be stored on the function itself and it will stand alone and only be synchronized with calls to the same function.
</p><p>
For the case of the instance method, the thread lock will be stored on the instance of the class the instance methods are bound too and any instance methods marked as being synchronized on that class will all synchronize on that single thread lock, thus mimicking how Java behaves.
</p><p>
Now what about that class method. In this case the instance argument is actually the class type. If the thread lock is stored on the type, then the result would be that if there were multiple class methods and they were all marked as synchronized, they would exclude each other. The thread lock in this case is distinct from any used by instance methods, but that is also actually what we want.
</p><p>
Does the code work though for a class method?
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Object.method_cm()<br/>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br/>
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br/>
  File "test.py", line 38, in __call__<br/>
    return self.wrapper(self.wrapped, instance, args, kwargs)<br/>
  File "synctest.py", line 176, in synchronized<br/>
    lock = context.setdefault('_synchronized_lock',<br/>
AttributeError: 'dictproxy' object has no attribute 'setdefault'</blockquote><p>
Unfortunately not.
</p><p>
The reason this is the case is that the __dict__ of a class type is not a normal dictionary, but a dictproxy. A dictproxy doesn't share the same methods as a normal dict and in particular, it does not provide the setdefault() method.
</p><p>
We therefore need a different way of synchronizing the creation of the thread lock the first time for the case where instance is a class.
</p><p>
We also have another issue due to a dictproxy being used. That is that dictproxy doesn't support item assignment.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(Object)['_synchronized_lock'] = threading.RLock()<br/>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br/>
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br/>
TypeError: 'dictproxy' object does not support item assignment</blockquote><p>
What it does still support though is attribute assignment.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
&gt;&gt;&gt; setattr(Object, '_synchronized_lock', threading.RLock())<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Object._synchronized_lock<br/>
&lt;_RLock owner=None count=0&gt;</blockquote><p>
and since both function objects and class instances do as well, we will need to switch to that method of updating attributes.

</p><h3>
Storing a meta lock on the decorator</h3>
<p>
As to an alternative for using dict.setdefault() as an atomic way of setting the lock the first time, what we can do instead is use a meta thread lock stored on the @synchronized decorator itself. With this we still have the issue though of ensuring that only one thread can get to set it. We therefore use dict.setdefault() to control creation of the meta lock at least.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
@decorator<br/>
def synchronized(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):<br/>
    if instance is None:<br/>
        owner = wrapped<br/>
    else:<br/>
        owner = instance </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    lock = vars(owner).get('_synchronized_lock', None) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    if lock is None:<br/>
        meta_lock = vars(synchronized).setdefault(<br/>
                '_synchronized_meta_lock', threading.Lock()) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
        with meta_lock:<br/>
            lock = vars(owner).get('_synchronized_lock', None) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
            if lock is None:<br/>
                lock = threading.RLock()<br/>
                setattr(owner, '_synchronized_lock', lock) </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    with lock:<br/>
        return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)</blockquote><p>
Note that because of the gap between checking for the existence of the lock for the wrapped function and creating the meta lock, after we have acquired the meta lock we need to once again check to see if the lock exists. This is to handle the case where two threads came into the code at the same time and are racing to be the first to create the lock.
</p><p>
Now one thing which is very important in this change is that we only swapped to using attribute access for updating the lock for the wrapped function. We have not changed to using getattr() for looking up the lock in the first place and are still looking it up in __dict__ as returned by vars().
</p><p>
This is necessary because when getattr() is used on an instance of a class, if that attribute doesn't exist on the instance of the class, then the lookup rules mean that if the attribute instead existed on the class type, then that would be returned instead.
</p><p>
This would cause problems if a synchronized class method was the first to be called, because it would then leave a lock on the class type. When the instance method was subsequently called, if getattr() were used, it would find the lock on the class type and return it and it would be wrongly used. Thus we stay with looking for the lock via __dict__ as that will only contain what actually exists in the instance.
</p><p>
With these changes we are now all done and all lock creation is now completely automatic, with an appropriate lock created for the different contexts the decorator is used in.
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized<br/>
def function():<br/>
    pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
class Object(object):<br/>
    @synchronized<br/>
    def method_im(self):<br/>
        pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @synchronized<br/>
    @classmethod<br/>
    def method_cm(cls):<br/>
        pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&gt;&gt;&gt; o.method_im()<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(o._synchronized_lock)<br/>
4338904592</blockquote><p>
The code also works for where @synchronized is used on a static method or class type. In summary, the result for the different places @synchronized can be placed is:
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized # lock bound to function1<br/>
def function1():<br/>
    pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized # lock bound to function2<br/>
def function2():<br/>
    pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
@synchronized # lock bound to Class<br/>
class Class(object): </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @synchronized # lock bound to instance of Class<br/>
    def function_im(self):<br/>
        pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @synchronized # lock bound to Class<br/>
    @classmethod<br/>
    def function_cm(cls):<br/>
        pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @synchronized # lock bound to function_sm<br/>
    @staticmethod<br/>
    def function_sm():<br/>
        pass</blockquote>

<h3>
Implementing synchronized statements</h3>
<p>
So we are all done with implementing support for synchronized methods, but what about those synchronized statements. The goal here is that we want to be able to write:
</p><blockquote class="tr_bq">
class Object(object): </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    @synchronized<br/>
    def function_im_1(self):<br/>
        pass </blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
    def function_im_2(self):<br/>
        with synchronized(self):<br/>
            pass</blockquote><p>
That is, we need for 'synchronized' to not only be usable as a decorator, but for it also be able to be used as a context manager.
</p><p>
In this role, similar to with Java, it would be supplied the object on which synchronization is to occur, which for instance methods would be the 'self' object or instance of the class.
</p><p>
For an explanation of how we can do this though, you will need to wait for the next instalment in this series of posts.
