<p>Assumption1: You can set your IDE to fire a script on file save.</p>

<p>Assumption2: That script can receive the name of the file being saved and access the file contents.</p>

<p>You could create a test coverage description "file" (storage location: irrelevant) something along lines of:</p>

<pre><code>**module**         **tested by**
mymod1.py       testsuite1.py
mymod2.py       testsuite2.py
mysubmod1.py    testsuite3.py
mysubmod2.py    testsuite3.py
</code></pre>

<p>read your saved file to get the import statements and retrieve all needed values from the tested by column to cover your saved file and dependencies.  Then run your test modules.</p>

<p>I suppose this could also work from a command line, taking the changed file name as a parameter. </p>

<p>I think maybe the dependency tracking needs to go the other way.  If so, then have to parse the imports for everything in the directory looking for the changed module.  The rest of the process would be the same. </p>
