<span><a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/44/project-jupyter-and-ipython" target="_blank">Episode #44: Project Jupyter and IPython</a></span><br/>
One of the fastest growing areas in Python is scientific computing. In scientific computing with Python, there are a few key packages that make it special. These include NumPy / SciPy / and related packages. The one that brings it all together, visually, is IPython (now known as Project Jupyter). That's the topic on this episode. You'll learn about "the big split", the plans for the recent $6 million in funding, Jupyter at CERN and the LHC and more with Min RK &amp; Matthias Bussonnier. <br/>

<span><a href="http://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html" target="_blank">How convolutional neural networks see the world</a></span><br/>
In this post, we take a look at what deep convolutional neural networks (convnets) really learn, and how they understand the images we feed them. We will use Keras to visualize inputs that maximize the activation of the filters in different layers of the VGG16 architecture, trained on ImageNet. <br/>

With Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt you'll learn how to build efficient GUI applications that run on all major operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and many versions of Unix, using the same source code for all of them. Summerfield systematically introduces every core GUI development technique: from dialogs and windows to data handling; from events to printing; and more. Through the book's realistic examples you'll discover a completely new PyQt 4-based programming approach, as well as coverage of many new topics, from PyQt 4's rich text engine to advanced model/view and graphics/view programming. nd PyQt 4.3.<br/>
