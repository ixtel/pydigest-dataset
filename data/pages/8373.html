<p>Our year end review of 2015 launched projects and plans for 2016. </p>
<p>Justin Myles-Holmes will discuss hendrix. He is a core contributor to hendrix, a Twisted-based WSGI container that makes async and offbeat-network traffic easy, fun and fast!</p> 
<p>Title: "Async and offbeat network traffic: Django + Twisted = hendrix." </p> 
<p><span>Summary: "Twisted is a battle-tested networking engine for Python. It's one of the best and most actively maintained open source software projects in the world. Yet, the two most popular WSGI publishers, gunicorn and uWsgi, don't use it. Meet the third most popular, and rapidly growing: hendrix. hendrix wraps Django in the Twisted reactor, with some strange, silly, and highly performant results." </span></p> 
<p><span>Bio: Justin Holmes is software activist who lives on a school bus with his partner Chelsea and their baby Fibonacci. He solves problems at software startups in NYC and San Francisco and frequently speaks at various conferences and festivals. <br/></span></p> 
<p>Jeff Revesz, Director of AdTech at BuzzFeed presents his fun side project: Canvas Game Development with Django. <br/></p>
<p>We open the floor to lightning talks about your Django site and related web insights. If you learned something interesting this year share it with the rest of us.</p>
