      Sinklog combines your log outputs into a single stream.
      All you need to start logging is a name.
      It has to be globally unique–so pick a good one!

      <h2 class="section-title">How To Use It</h2>

      <p>
        Use the <code>logger</code> command or another syslog client to send a message.
        Check out the tools and examples on <a href="https://github.com/sinklog">GitHub</a>.
      </p>

      <p/><pre><code>logger -t logkey -n sinklog.com "my log message"</code></pre>

      <p>
        Logs are aggregated into a single stream and made available over HTTP so they can be viewed live in a browser or terminal.
        Itâs like running <code>tail -f</code> across multiple hosts.

      <h2 class="section-title">How It Works</h2>

      <p>
        Logs are transported over syslog and aggregated by tag.
        After you pick a name you will receive a log key to use as a tag that can be used with your existing loggers.
      </p>

      <p>Log data is not archived, it is kept in a short buffer and flushed. Sinklog is not a log storage service.</p>
