    <p>One Direction are a hugely popular boy band, and they’ve decided to hold the only two <span class="caps">UK</span> dates of their European tour at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium - right in the middle of our conference, on the 5th and 6th of June.</p>
    <p>This means that an extra 140‘000 people (Cardiff’s population is only 340‘000 to begin with) will be in town over those two nights. </p>
    <p>The result is that the hotels we have been discussing attendee accommodation with have informed us that their rooms are now fully booked. </p>
    <p>In fact, nearly no hotel accommodation is now available, either in the city or around it on those dates.</p>
    <p>
      <em>We’re left with no choice but to reschedule the event.</em> We’re close to making a decision on the dates, and will announce it, and re-open registration as soon as we can.</p>
    <p>We’ll probably find this funny, when we look back on it (perhaps as soon as fifty or sixty years from now) but at the moment we’re not enjoying the situation.</p>
    <p>Of course anyone who has already registered will be able to have a full refund if the new dates are unsuitable for them.</p>
    <p>Many apologies, and thanks for your patience while we work to sort out this unwanted surprise.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Update: <a href="/news/djangocon-rescheduled/">DjangoCon has been safely rescheduled</a>, to start and end two days earlier. All is well.</strong>
