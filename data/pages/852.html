<p align="justify">
I visioned that this article will be your first article in how to 
properly start coding in Python. And lets be brief in this: you are 
going to understand what does it means by the following three ways of 
organizing Python code:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Module</li>
	<li>Package</li>
	<li>Class </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
All, through the eye of a Python programmer. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Those three terms are your fundamental key in understanding how to properly organize your Python application.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Great. Lets get started!
</p>
<p align="justify"> 
</p>
<h2>Why do I have to organize my application code?</h2>
<p align="justify">
Well, actually you don't have to. <img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/js/tinymce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" border="0" alt="Smile" title="Smile"/> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
In the context of whether it's a mandatory or not, well, it is not.  
Your application code can live peacefully in a single file, like our <a href="https://github.com/pythonthusiast/bio/blob/single_file/wsgi/main.py" target="_blank">single file</a> version of Flask Biography application or it can be organized into a much more modular application, like our <a href="https://github.com/pythonthusiast/bio/tree/blueprints/wsgi" target="_blank">Blueprint version</a> of Flask Biography application. Certainly the reasons that drive a better code organization are:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Modularity<br/>
	This term highly related to the fact that your unit of application code are easily identified into distinguishable part.  </li>
	<li>Extensibility<br/>
	As
	the unit of application code already easily identified, you will then 
	will be very easy in extending the current application code</li>
	<li>Self documenting <br/>
	Now that it's highly modular, using a proper code convention such as <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a>, you will then will be able to create a code that clear to understand. </li>
	<li>Easier to communicate<br/>
	With
	self documenting code, there come a whole lot of easier way in 
	communicating your code to others. This is particularly important in a 
	team work and still also applied if you are working alone. And why is 
	that so? Because if you do encounter difficult task in your code 
	development, you can easily explained your problem to others by exposing
	your high quality code. People on the internet will have a better 
	chance to solved your problem if your code is easy to understand. </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
Be advise though, that the above four reasons are coming from the many 
reasons that one can come up by thinking the advantages of properly organizing your
code. You will come up with more reasons once you develop your own 
application. 
</p>
<h2>Study Case: A Glimpse of Our Next Productivity Application<br/>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
This article in some way is a continuation of my <a href="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/230_pythonthusiast/archive/1389_reviving_microsoft_agent_using_pywin32-run_the_agent_hourly.html">previous article</a>
that specifically discuss how to use PyWin32 package to revive MS 
Agent. In preparing its overall application design, I realize that I haven't 
add another article in <a href="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/230_pythonthusiast/categories/443_python_for_beginner.html">Python for Beginner</a>
series. Therefore, I think it's a perfect time for a beginner article 
that revisit how to properly organize a Python application, by using our
yet-to-be productivity application, code named : <em>"Northed"</em>
</p>
<p align="justify">
For sake of simplicity, the thing that will be our concern right now for <em>Northed</em>
application functionality is its ability to <strong>manage and display alarm in certain interval: whether a one time alarm or repeated alarm</strong>.
That's all. Nothing more. Although, got to say, I really tempted to 
begin with a full closure of the overall application features. But I 
believe it will only clutter up the discussion with unnecessary 
complexity. Another point to note is, for a working draft of what this <em>Northed</em> application be like, you can try to run the current <a href="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/230_pythonthusiast/archive/1389_reviving_microsoft_agent_using_pywin32-run_the_agent_hourly.html">MS Agent application</a>
that will stay silent in the system tray and regularly announce the 
time in hourly bases. I have use it in more than a month now, and got
several ideas how to make the application more useful for my daily 
need. And that's why I initiate a new article series that specifically 
talk about how to design and implement this productivity application.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Also, we will not going to implement the real code for this alarm 
feature. Only the mockup suit us just fine for the purpose of this 
article.
</p>
<h2>Step 1: Alarm Feature As A Python Module
</h2>
<p align="justify">
In its simplest, this alarm features must reside in a Python 
module, which is just a regular file having .py extension. Inside this 
module you will have to implement alarm features using all sort of 
function and other related data structures. In this first step, I would 
like to present the module in its functions signature only. I hope the 
function name intuitive enough for you to guess what their roles are (I 
also accompany it with some comment). Therefore, the function body will 
only have a <code>pass</code> statement, which does nothing: it only act as a placeholder for future code. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Great. Below is the content of <code>alarm.py</code> using intuitive functions name:

<p align="justify">
The next question is, how do you use all of the above functions from 
another Python module (*.py file) ? Here is simplest way to do that:

<p> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
The above code was saved in the file <code>main.py</code> located in the same directory as the file <code>alarm.py</code>. Have a look at how I simply call the statement <code>import alarm</code>, and then you can call all functions within that module using the dot operator: e.g., <code>alarm.remove_alarm(2)</code>. You can also shortened how you call all functions within <code>alarm</code> module this way:

<p>

<p align="justify">
Overall, the above code is not a good habit. Things can become confusing
when you already import more than one module: you simply can't relate 
which functions belong to which modules. Although, there are cases when 
this simplification is needed. Decide it by your own, whether you will 
not get confused when using this import style.  
</p>
<p align="justify">
Finally, you can import just the method that you need. Have a look at this code:

<p> 
</p>
<p align="justify">
With the above import style, there will be a good reference for you (or 
other that read your code) from which modules are certain functions 
coming from. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
 
</p>
<h2>Step 2: Make Alarm Module As Part of A Package
</h2>
<p align="justify">
Although in this article I present to you only a single alarm module, 
you don't suppose that the final product will only composed with one 
file module, right? If, say, you have 15 modules (meaning 15 *.py 
files), while all modules can be grouped by its different purpose (e.g. 
GUI layout, database access, models, scheduling, etc), you will need 
another way to organize your python application: package. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Package is implemented in Python as directory containing a single <code>__init__.py</code>
file. Within this directory you can put any related python modules 
(*.py files) and then import it in another module, just the way you 
imported <code>alarm</code> feature previously. Have a look below at our
application without special consideration of its packages organization.
Notice how I add several hypothetical modules to complete our example: 
</p>
 
<div align="center">
<img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/gallery/230/without_package.png" alt="Without clear package organization, it's not easy to understand your application structure"/>
<p>
Without clear package organization, it's not easy to understand your application structure
</p>
</div>
<p align="justify">
I bet you will not be able to quickly distinguish the groups where each 
modules belong to. The structure above only gives you little to no 
information regarding where each modules belongs to. Compare the above 
structure with below structure, that already organize its modules using 
packages:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/gallery/230/with_package.png" alt="Using a good package organization, even new programmer who read your code will be able to quickly understand your application structure"/>
<p>
Using a good package organization, even new programmer who read your 
code will be able to quickly understand your application structure
</p>
</div>
<p align="justify">
Now you can clearly see what are groups of packages that composed your 
application. Somehow, you even can tell that main.py will responsible in
starting up your application. When you want to dig more to the 
application structure, you can expand the packages to be as follows:
</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/gallery/230/expand.png" alt="In expanded state, you can have a full closure of your application structure"/>
<p>
In expanded state, you can have a full closure of your application structure
</p>
</div>
<p align="justify">
 
</p>
<p>
You maybe thinking, <em>"So? What so special about it? Creating directory is a regular way of organizing files"</em>. Yes, it is, if it's not for that special <code>__init__.py</code> file.
</p>
<p>
Python will treat <code>__init__.py</code> file differently. Each time the package was imported, Python will execute <code>__init__.py</code>, making it as initializer function for that package. For example, when importing <code>alarm</code> module from <code>scheduling</code>
package, we can make sure --hypothetically-- that any alarm that 
haven't been started and fall within near future occurrence time, to be 
started and ready to run. This behaviour as far as I know is specific 
for Python programming only. You won't find this kind of behaviour of 
treating a file as initializer code for a package in other programming 
languages (at least that I know of). To be honest, this is one simple 
thing that make me so intrigued in trying my best in mastering Python...
</p>
<h2>Step 3: Turn Alarm Into Class<br/>
</h2>
<p>
Actually, this topic can be spin off into its own article: discussing 
mainly about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. I've even 
began to think that we need to revisit this OOP topic in subsequent 
article in this site. Also, although the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=philosophical+concept+of+oop&amp;oq=philosophical+concept+of+oop&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.12479j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=93&amp;ie=UTF-8">philosophical concept</a> of OOP is so daunting, its implementation is rather easy. It gets even easier in Python. Have a look at our <code>alarm.py</code> code above. To convert the above module into class, you will have to do three steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add <code>class</code> statement in the beginning of alarm code</li>
	<li>Increase indentation level for all existing alarm code </li>
	<li>For all functions (now we call them methods, as now we are talking in OOP term), add <code>self</code> as first argument</li>
	<li>Move all variables (now we call them properties) needed by alarm code into a new method --intuitively-- named <code>__init__</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Below is the result of turning our Alarm code (still saved in the previous <code>alarm.py</code>) into valid Python class:

<span>        """</span>
        <span>pass</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
Pretty easy, right? Now, to use this new Alarm class, we do it this way:

<span>print</span><span>(</span>main_alarm.<span>get_count</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
Notice how we still have to import the <code>alarm</code> module first, and then instantiate a new object using the new <code>Alarm</code> class, into variable named <code>main_alarm</code>. After that, you can access all the methods and properties available. 
</p>
<p>
You maybe wondering, <em>"It's not that different. What is the advantage of using class instead of just module?"</em>. Great, lets be brief on this, below I give some advantages when using class instead of plain module:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">
	You do realize that we store the instantiation of <code>Alarm</code> class into <code>main_alarm</code>,
	right? This is the feature that only existed in OOP: where you can 
	encapsulate methods and properties into a class and then you can have 
	multiple objects which is instantiation of that single class. Hence, you
	will  be able to have another <code>Alarm</code> class instantiation into unlimited number of objects such as <code>secondary_alarm</code>, <code>support_alarm</code>, etc.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>Inheritance: you can define a new class using existing class, adding new important features to the new class. </li>
	<li>In class, you will have a better way to relate properties/variables to methods/functions, than it is in module.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Bonus Step 4: Implement Alarm Feature Using Dict <br/>
</h2>
<p align="justify">
Actually, I would love to stop at Step 3 when we discuss how to turn 
Alarm into a class. But, for those that curious enough, I add another 
step here: implementing Alarm using Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">dict</a>.  Have a look at this code (in plain module version):

Dictionary is a data structure where you an 
associate a key (in this case an integer) to value (another dictionary 
object to hold alarm data). How do we use this new module? 
</p>
<p align="justify">
At least there are two approaches to test a new module: you can directly
use it inside the module itself or create a separate unit test for it 
(for a rather complete unit testing article, you can refer to <a href="http://pythonthusiast.pythonblogs.com/230_pythonthusiast/archive/1354_developing_cross_platform_application_using_qt_pyqt_and_pyside__test_driven_development_and_unit_testing-part_3_of_5.html">this article</a>
in this site). I choose the later approach as it keep the module clean.
Therefore, below is the unit test module that clearly demonstrate how 
to use  <code>alarm</code> module:

If you have successfully run the unit test code either in PyCharm or any
other Python IDE, ... congratulations! That is a wonderful progress you
have there.

I intended the discussion in this article to serve as the first 
"official" Python introductory material in this site. Although when 
publishing article in this site I always take beginner level into 
account, I never really dedicated introductory article for it. 
Therefore, I do hope that I aim at the right spot when discussing ways 
you can organize your Python code.
