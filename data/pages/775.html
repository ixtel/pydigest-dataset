<html><body><div><div class="pf-content"><p>Reportlab recently released version 3.1 which now fully supports Python 3 and Python 2.7. They had actually released a Python 3 compatible version about a month or so ago, but this one sounds like they’ve worked the bugs out of that initial release as this version also supports their commercial customers. I find this exciting in that one of my favorite Python packages finally supports Python 3. I haven’t moved to Python 3 myself because I use so many packages that are only available for Python 2 (and also because I have yet to work for a place that uses Python 3). There aren’t really any awesome new features in Reportlab 3.1 as of yet, but you can read through their <a href="http://www.reportlab.com/software/documentation/relnotes/31/" target="_blank">release notes</a> and decide for yourself.</p>
<p>One cool new feature of Reportlab is that you can now install it with pip or easy_install. They have also introduced Python wheel packages as their primary installation type, although you can still download the source. See PyPI for the open source <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab/3.1.8" target="_blank">downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>
