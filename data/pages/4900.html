Anyone interested in speaking is encouraged to submit a proposal for talks and tutorials. There are no restrictions on topics, but we recommend they be of interest to Pythonistas. Talks will fill slots of 25 minutes and 55 minutes, including time for questions and answers.<br/>

Does a computer see in color or black and white? It's time to find out on this episode of Talk Python to Me. Join Adrian Rosebrock as we talk about PyImageSearch, OpenCV, and building computer vision systems with Python and OpenCV. This show is part theory, part history, part programming technicals and all coolness. <br/>

<span><a href="https://dato.com/learn/gallery/notebooks/food_retrieval-public.html" target="_blank">Bringing Deep Learning to the Grocery Store</a></span><br/>
Food is an important part of everybody's life. Not only does food influence how we look and feel, agriculture also has a profound impact on ecosystems, economies, and politics. Yet when we go to the grocery store, it can be difficult to really know exactly what we're purchasing and where it comes from. Inspired by this problem, a few of us decided to build an application that provides information on a packaged food product based on an image taken with a smartphone. In a future blog post, we will share what we built and how we built it. In this notebook, however, we delve deeper into the actual implementation.<br/>

In the last post we detailed how to validate email addresses during user registration. This time, we'll add unit and integration tests (yay!) to our application using the Flask-Testing extension, covering the most important features. This type of testing is called Minimum Viable Testing (or Risk-based Testing) and is designed to test the high-risk functionality, centered around the application's features.<br/>
