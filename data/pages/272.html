<h1>easyAI</h1>
<p>EasyAI is an artificial intelligence framework for two-players abstract games such as Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, Reversi, etc.</p>
<p>It is written in Python and makes it easy to define the mechanisms of a game and play against the computer or solve the game (see <a class="reference internal" href="examples/quick_example.html#a-quick-example"><em>A quick example</em></a>).</p>
<p>Under the hood, the AI is a Negamax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables as described on <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax">Wikipedia</a>. It has been written with clarity/simplicity in mind, rather than speed, so it can be slow, but there are fixes (see <a class="reference internal" href="examples/speedup.html#speedup"><em>How to make the AI faster</em></a>).</p>

<p>EasyAI is an open source software originally written by <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Zulko">Zulko</a> and released under the MIT licence.
It is hosted on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Zulko/easyAI">Github</a>, where you can submit improvements, get support, etc.</p>
<p>Some ideas of improvements are: AI algos for incomplete information games, better game solving strategies, (efficient) use of databases to store moves,  AI algorithms using parallelisation. Want to make one of these happen ?</p>
