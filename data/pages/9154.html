We're building all of our systems from the ground up so they are agile and we can move fast. We are a VC-funded startup (SoftTech is our lead investor), backed by Y Combinator (W'15), and based in SoMa, San Francisco.</p></div><div class="section section page-centered"><p/><p>About Chariot and #commutesolved:</p><p><br/></p><p>Chariot is the world's first crowdfunded network of commuter routes that is faster and more reliable than mass transit and much more affordable than ridesharing and driving. The company employs Charioteers who drive brand new 15-passenger vans between popular residential and work districts and commuter hubs like BART and Caltrain, often in half the time and cost as mass transit and ridesharing, respectively.</p><p><br/></p><p>Founded in 2014 in SF, Chariot has expanded to eight routes providing 12k rides per week with an 85% long-term retention rate as of Dec 2015.  The company crowdfunds new commuter routes based on user demand, allowing the public to efficiently fill in transit gaps. Chariot raised a $3mm seed round, was in YC's Winter'15 batch and will reach 20 routes and expand to the greater Bay Area by Q1 2016.</p></div></div></body></html>
