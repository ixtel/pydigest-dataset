<div id="motivation">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>It’s frustrating dealing with the zip files full of assignment
submissions that you get from D2L.</p>
<ul>
<li>Merging all of a student’s submissions into a single folder is
tedious.</li>
<li>Navigating submissions on the command line sucks, because each
directory name starts with a long number.</li>
<li>Extracting all the zip files, tar archives, and 7z archives that
students submit adds a needless extra step to marking.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve found this tool useful for eliminating those annoyances, and I hope
you will too.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-use">
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>This is the most common command I use:</p>
<pre>d2lmf extract -xjcm <span class="s2">"Assignment 1 Download Oct 11, 2015 803 PM.zip"</span> A1/T01
</pre>
<p>This extracts the submissions from the zip folder into the directory
<tt>A1/T01</tt>. The <tt><span class="pre">-x</span></tt> specifies that we want to extract any zip, rar,
tar, or 7z archives that students submitted. The <tt><span class="pre">-j</span></tt> deletes ‘junk’
like <tt>.DS_Store</tt>. The <tt><span class="pre">-c</span></tt> collapses needlessly nested directories.
Finally, the <tt><span class="pre">-m</span></tt> merges all submitted files into a single directory
for each student. Cool!</p>
<p>On Windows, you may need to invoke d2lmf as a Python module, like so:</p>
<pre>python -m d2lmf extract -xjcm <span class="s2">"Assignment 1 Download Oct 11, 2015 803 PM.zip"</span> A1/T01
</pre>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<pre>sudo apt-get install python-pip

<div id="dependencies">
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>The extraction of rar and 7z archives depends on external tools. If you
do not have a rar or 7z utility installed, those archives will be
skipped.</p>
<p>On Windows, I suggest installing <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" rel="nofollow">7-Zip</a>. On
Ubuntu, p7zip is the equivalent, and it can be installed with
<tt>sudo <span class="pre">apt-get</span> install <span class="pre">p7zip-full</span></tt>. p7zip is also available for OSX,
and can be installed from <a href="http://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">homebrew</a> with
<tt>brew install p7zip</tt>.</p>
