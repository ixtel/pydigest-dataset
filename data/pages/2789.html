<h2>The statement is not exactly true</h2>

<p>Just like V8 is just an implementation for JS, CPython is just one implementation for Python. <a href="http://www.cdotson.com/2014/08/nodejs-vs-python-vs-pypy-a-simple-performance-comparison/" rel="nofollow">Pypy has performances matching V8's</a>.</p>

<p>Also, there the problem of perceived performance : since V8 is natively non blocking, Web dev leads to more performant projects because you save the IO wait. And V8 is mainly used for dev Web where IO is key, so they compare it to similar projects. But you can use Python in many, many other areas than web dev. And you can even use C extensions for a lot of tasks, such as scientific computations or encryption, and crunch data with blazing perfs.</p>

<p>But on the web, most popular Python and Ruby projects are blocking. Python, especially, has the legacy of the synchronous WSGI standard, and frameworks like the famous Django are based on it.</p>

<p>You can write asynchronous Python (like with Twisted, Tornado, gevent or asyncio) or Ruby. But it's not done often. The best tools are still blocking.</p>

<p>However, they are some reasons for why the default implementations in Ruby and Python are not as speedy as V8.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>Like JÃ¶rg W Mittag pointed out, the guys working on V8 are VM geniuses. Python is dev by a bunch a passionate people, very good in a lot of domains, but are not as specialized in VM tuning.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>The Python Software foundation has very little money : <a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.fr/2012/01/psf-grants-over-37000-to-python.html" rel="nofollow">less than 40k</a> in a year to invest in Python. This is kinda crazy when you think big players such as Google, Facebook or Apple are all using Python, but it's the ugly truth : most work is done for free. The language that powers Youtube and existed before Java has been handcrafted by volunteers. </p>

<p>They are smart and dedicated volunteers, but when they identify they need more juice in a field, they can't ask for 300k to hire a top notch specialist for this area of expertise. They have to look around for somebody who would do it for free.</p>

<p>While this works, it means you have to be very a careful about your priorities. Hence, now we need to look at :</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Even with the latest modern features, writing Javascript is terrible. You have scoping issues, very few collections, terrible string and array manipulation, almost no stdlist apart from date, maths and regexes, and no syntactic sugar even for very common operations.</p>

<p>But in V8, you've got speed.</p>

<p>This is because, speed was the main objective for Google, since it's a bottleneck for page rendering in Chrome.</p>

<p>In Python, usability is the main objective. Because it's almost never the bottleneck on the project. The scarce resource here is developer time. It's optimized for the developer.</p>
