<p>Chances are you found yourself asking one of these questions after reading this tutorial's title:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why should I use CherryPy's pure-Python web server instead of a "real" stand-alone (perhaps C based) one for my WSGI application?</p></li>
<li><p>CherryPy...Isn't that a framework? What's that got to do with the deployment of my Bottle, Flask etc. based application?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many good answers and reasons for both. In this DigitalOcean article, we are going to find them. We will begin with talking about what CherryPy exactly is and the advantages of utilizing it for your web application. We will continue with explaining "why" and most importantly "how" you can deploy a Python application using CherryPy's Web Server.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-cherrypy-and-using-nginx">Understanding CherryPy and Using Nginx</h2>

<hr/>

<p>CherryPy as a whole is a minimalist Python Web Framework. What minimalist here means is it is not shipped with too many components out-of-the-box, whether you like (or need) them or not. Minimalism is basically refraining from imposing things on the developers without giving them a choice. CherryPy - and other such frameworks for that matter - usually handle the core necessities one would expect (e.g. sessions, caching, file uploads et al.) and leave the rest - and the choice - of what to use and how to use to be decided by <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>What separates CherryPy from other Python frameworks (including some "fully fledged" ones) is its developers' ambition to provide it ready to work (i.e. develop) with and ready to deploy as a self contained application bundle (package). In order to achieve this task, for web applications, a solid web server is a must. This is exactly where CherryPy excels, with its very own <strong>HTTP/1.1-compliant, WSGI thread-pooled Web Server</strong>. It is production-ready and just fantastic.</p>

<h3 id="cherrypy-wsgi-web-server-in-brief">CherryPy WSGI Web Server In Brief</h3>

<hr/>

<p>CherryPy's pure Python web server is a compact solution which comes with the namesake framework. Defined by the [CherryPy] project as a high-speed, production ready, thread pooled, generic HTTP server. It is a modularized component which can be used to serve any Python WSGI web application.</p>

<p><strong>CherryPy Web Server's Highlights:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A very compact and simple to use pure-Python solution</li>
<li>Easy to configure, easy to use</li>
<li>Thread-pooled and fast</li>
<li>Allows scaling</li>
<li>Supports SSL</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-deploy-with-cherrypy-39-s-wsgi-web-server">Why Deploy With CherryPy's WSGI Web Server?</h3>

<hr/>

<p>As we mentioned at the beginning, you are probably wondering about the reasons to use this solution instead of another hyped and famous one that you might have heard of or even tried. The truth of the matter is, thanks to the excellent specification of WSGI, it has been fairly easy to create a web server. Over the years, this gave birth to many of them, with some reaching a certain level of popularity and most remaining hidden inside its developer's machine.</p>

<p>The amount of choices are vast, and they all (mostly) do the same thing under-the-hood to a large extent.</p>

<p><strong>Why exactly should you use CherryPy web server for your application's deployment?</strong></p>

<p>The answer is rather simple: it is a joy to work with. The ease of use to serve your WSGI web application using CherryPy's server is exceptional. It will save you tons of headaches as you get up and running within a minute or two. It is customizable to a certain degree, giving you the ability to run both multi-process and multi-threaded instances the simplest way possible through a single file (e.g. server.py).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> For multi-process setups, you will need more than one "server" object instance configured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you are certain that within minutes of your application going online it will be getting tens of thousands of requests per second and you cannot simply use more servers to balance the load, then you are better off using your time to continue developing the application than hassling with libraries, CPU optimizations, dealing with crashes, etc.</p>

<p>CherryPy Web Server, coupled with (ease) using <strong><em>Nginx</em></strong> as a front-facing reverse-proxy is a truly rock solid way to serve Python WSGI based web applications, whether it be developed on top of Bottle, CherryPy, Django, Flask, Pyramid or any other framework.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>: The above mentioned architecture (explained below) enables you to easily scale horizontally (more servers) and even vertically (more capacity per server). Your "bottleneck" is likely to be the backend (database). That is why it’s not worth your while to try to optimize things to death before even having a promise of extreme loads. Even then, a sane caching mechanism, if introduced, will probably solve most of your problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-nginx-as-reverse-proxy-in-front-of-cherrypy">Using Nginx as Reverse-Proxy In Front of CherryPy</h3>

<hr/>

<p>Nginx is a very high performant <strong>web server</strong> / (<strong>reverse)-proxy</strong>. It has reached its popularity due to being light weight, relatively easy to work with and easy to extend (with add-ons / plug-ins). Thanks to its architecture, it is capable of handling <em>a lot</em> of requests (virtually <strong>unlimited</strong>), which - depending on your application or website load - could be really hard to tackle using some other, older alternatives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> "Handling" connections technically means not dropping them and being able to serve them with <em>something</em>. You still need your application and database functioning well in order to have Nginx serve clients <em>responses</em> that are not error messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why exactly should you use Nginx as a reverse-proxy in front of an application server?</strong></p>

<p>Although your application server - CherryPy WSGI web server in our case - can serve your application and its static files (e.g. javascript, css, images etc.), it is a very good idea to make use of a reverse-proxy, set up in front, such as Nginx. This relieves a lot of the load [from the application servers] as it handles the <em>client requests (and overheads)</em> and various other tasks, granting you a much better overall performance. </p>

<p>As your application grows, you will want to optimize it and when the time comes, distribute it across servers to be able to handle more connections simultaneously and have a generally more robust architecture. Having a reverse-proxy in front of your application server(s) helps you with this from very beginning as well.</p>

<p>Its extensibility (e.g. native caching along with failover and other mechanisms) is also a great feat that benefits web applications unlike (simpler) application servers.</p>

<p><strong>Example of a Basic Server Architecture:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">Client Request ----&gt; Nginx (Reverse-Proxy)
                        |
                       /|\                           
                      | | `-&gt; App. Server I.   127.0.0.1:8081
                      |  `--&gt; App. Server II.  127.0.0.1:8082
                       `----&gt; App. Server III. 127.0.0.1:8083
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When an application is set to listen for incoming connections on <code>127.0.0.1</code>, it will only be possible to access it locally. If you use <code>0.0.0.0</code>, however, it will accept connections from <em>the outside</em> as well.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-your-droplet-for-production">Preparing Your Droplet for Production</h2>

<hr/>

<p>In this section, we are going to prepare our droplet for production (i.e. for deploying our application).</p>

<p>We will begin with:</p>

<ul>
<li>updating the default operating system</li>
<li>downloading and installing common Python tools (i.e. pip, virtualenv)</li>
<li>and creating a virtual environment to contain the application (inside which its dependencies such as CherryPy reside).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Instructions given here are kept brief. To learn more, check out our how-to article on <em>pip</em> and <em>virtualenv</em>: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/common-python-tools-using-virtualenv-installing-with-pip-and-managing-packages">Common Python Tools: Using virtualenv, Installing with Pip, and Managing Packages</a>.</p>

<h3 id="updating-the-default-operating-system">Updating the default operating system</h3>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> We will be performing the following setup and preparations on a new droplet, using recent versions of operating systems. In theory, you should not have problems trying them on your server. However, if you already actively use it, we highly recommend switching to a new system before you try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To ensure that we have the latest available versions of default applications, we need to update our system.</p>

<p><strong>For Debian Based Systems (i.e. Ubuntu, Debian), run the following:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">aptitude    update
aptitude -y upgrade
</code></pre>
<p><strong>For RHEL Based Systems (i.e. CentOS), run the following:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">yum -y update
</code></pre>
<h3 id="setting-up-python-pip-and-virtualenv">Setting up Python, pip and virtualenv</h3>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note for CentOS / RHEL Users:</strong></p>

<p>CentOS / RHEL, by default, comes as a very lean server. Its toolset, which is likely to be dated for your needs, is <strong>not</strong> there to run your applications but to power the server's system tools (e.g. YUM).</p>

<p>In order to prepare your CentOS system, Python needs to be set up (i.e. compiled from the source) and <strong>pip</strong> / <strong>virtualenv</strong> need installing using that interpreter.</p>

<p>To learn about How to Set Up Python 2.7.6 and 3.3.3 on CentOS 6.4 and 5.8 with pip and virtualenv, please refer to: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-python-2-7-6-and-3-3-3-on-centos-6-4">How to Set Up Python 2.7.6 and 3.3.3 on CentOS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Ubuntu and Debian, a recent version of Python interpreter which you can use comes by default. It leaves us with only a limited number of additional packages to install:</p>

<ul>
<li>python-dev (development tools),</li>
<li>pip (to manage packages),</li>
<li>virtualenv (to create isolated, virtual environments).</li>
</ul>

<p>python-dev:</p>

<p>python-dev is an operating-system level package which contains extended development tools for building Python modules.</p>

<p>Run the following command to install python-dev using aptitude:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">aptitude install python-dev
</code></pre>
<p><strong>pip:</strong></p>

<p>pip is a package manager which will help us to install the application packages that we need.</p>

<p>Run the following commands to install pip:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">curl https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py | python -
curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python -
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You might need sudo privileges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>virtualenv:</strong></p>

<p>It is best to contain a Python application within its own environment, together with all of its dependencies. An environment can be best described (in simple terms) as an isolated location (a directory) where everything resides. For this purpose, a tool called <strong><em>virtualenv</em></strong> is used.</p>

<p>Run the following to install virtualenv using pip:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">sudo pip install virtualenv
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-self-contained-virtual-python-environment">Creating a self-contained Virtual (Python) Environment</h3>

<hr/>

<p>Having all the necessary tools ready at our disposal, we can create an environment deploy our application.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> If you haven't got a virtualenv on your development (local) machine for your project, you should consider creating one and moving your application (and its dependencies) inside.</p>

<p>Let's begin with creating a folder which will contain both the <em>virtual environment</em> and <em>your application module</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can use any name here to suit your needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">mkdir my_app
</code></pre>
<p>We can continue with entering this folder and creating a new virtual environment inside:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can also choose any name you like for your virtual environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">cd my_app
virtualenv my_app_venv
</code></pre>
<p>Let's create a new folder there to contain your Python application module as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the folder where your application module will reside.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">mkdir app
</code></pre>
<p>And activate the interpreter inside the virtual environment to use it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please make sure to use the name you chose for your virtual environment if you went for something other than "my<em>app</em>venv".</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">source my_app_venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>In the end, this is how your main application deployment directory should look like:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">my_app              # Main Folder to Contain Everything Together
  |
  |=== my_app_venv  # V. Env. folder with the Python Int.
  |=== app          # Your application module
  |..
  |.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="downloading-and-installing-cherrypy">Downloading and installing CherryPy</h3>

<hr/>

<p>In order to use CherryPy's WSGI Web Server, we first need to have it downloaded and installed.</p>

<p><strong>To install CherryPy using pip, run the following:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">pip install cherrypy
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are working inside an environment, CherryPy will be installed there. Otherwise, the installation will be <em>globally available</em> (i.e. systemwide). Global installation is not recommended. Always opt for using <strong>virtualenv</strong> both on your server and your development machine.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Run the following command to use the default system package manager <em>aptitude</em> install Nginx:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">sudo aptitude install nginx
</code></pre>
<p>To run Nginx, you can use the following:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">sudo service nginx start

<p>To restart Nginx, you can use the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After each time you reconfigure Nginx, a restart or reload is needed for the new settings to come into effect.  </p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">sudo service nginx restart
</code></pre>

<h2 id="serving-python-web-applications-with-cherrypy-web-server">Serving Python Web Applications with CherryPy Web Server</h2>

<hr/>

<p>In this section, we will see how a WSGI application works with CherryPy web server. This process consists of providing the server with a <strong><em>WSGI application callable</em></strong> (e.g. <code>application = (..)</code>) as the point of entry.</p>

<h3 id="wsgi">WSGI</h3>

<hr/>

<p>WSGI in a nutshell is an interface between a web server and the application itself. It exists to ensure a standardized way between various servers and applications (frameworks) to work with each other, allowing interchangeability when necessary (e.g. switching from development to production environment), which is a must-have need nowadays.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are interested in learning more about <strong>WSGI</strong> and <strong>Python web servers</strong>, check out our article: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/a-comparison-of-web-servers-for-python-based-web-applications">A Comparison of Web Servers for Python Based Web Applications</a>.</p>

<h3 id="wsgi-application-object-callable-wsgi-py">WSGI Application Object (Callable): <code>wsgi.py</code></h3>

<hr/>

<p>As mentioned above, web servers running on WSGI need an application object (i.e. your application's).</p>

<p>With most frameworks and applications, this consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>A wsgi.py to contain and provide an application object (or callable) to be used by the server.</li>
<li>And a server.py which <em>includes</em> the application object and uses it to serve.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will begin with creating an exemplary “wsgi.py” and continue with creating a common “server.py” for CherryPy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can choose any name instead of wsgi.py and server.py. However, these are the ones that are commonly used (e.g. by Django).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's begin with creating a wsgi.py file to contain a basic WSGI application.</p>

<p><strong>Run the following command to create a wsgi.py using the text editor nano:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">nano wsgi.py
</code></pre>
<p>Let's continue with moving (copy/paste) the basic WSGI application code inside (which should be replaced with your own application's callable for production):</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">def application(env, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/html')])
    return ["Hello!"]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the file that is included by the server and each time a request comes, the server uses this application callable to run the application's request handlers (i.e. controllers) upon parsing the URL (e.g. mysite.tld/controller/method/variable).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After placing the application code in, press CTRL+X and then confirm with Y to save this file inside the <code>my_app</code> folder alongside the virtual environment and the app module containing your actual application.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This WSGI application is the most basic example to its kind. You will need to replace this code block to include your own application object from the application module.</p>

<p>Once we are done, this is how your main application deployment directory should look like:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">my_app              # Main Folder to Contain Everything Together
  |
  |=== my_app_venv  # V. Env. folder with the Python Int.
  |=== app          # Your application module
  |
  |--- wsgi.py      # File containing application callable
  |..
  |.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="creating-a-script-to-use-cherrypy-web-server-server-py">Creating a script to use CherryPy Web Server: <code>server.py</code></h3>

<hr/>

<p>Inside our current working directory (e.g. my_app) folder, we now need to create a Python script which:</p>

<ul>
<li>Includes the application</li>
<li>Creates one or more CherryPy web server instances</li>
<li>Configures these server instances</li>
<li>Starts and stops the server engine(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are multiple ways to obtain such script and in the below example, we will use a simple but easy to configure one.</p>

<p>Create a server.py file to contain the web server launch script using nano:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">nano server.py
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Inside this file, write (copy/paste) the following server snippet:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs=""># Import your application as:
# from wsgi import application
# Example:

from wsgi import application

# Import CherryPy
import cherrypy

if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Mount the application
    cherrypy.tree.graft(application, "/")

    # Unsubscribe the default server
    cherrypy.server.unsubscribe()

    # Instantiate a new server object
    server = cherrypy._cpserver.Server()

    # Configure the server object
    server.socket_host = "0.0.0.0"
    server.socket_port = 8080
    server.thread_pool = 30

    # For SSL Support
    # server.ssl_module            = 'pyopenssl'
    # server.ssl_certificate       = 'ssl/certificate.crt'
    # server.ssl_private_key       = 'ssl/private.key'
    # server.ssl_certificate_chain = 'ssl/bundle.crt'

    # Subscribe this server
    server.subscribe()

    # Example for a 2nd server (same steps as above):
    # Remember to use a different port

    # server2             = cherrypy._cpserver.Server()

    # server2.socket_host = "0.0.0.0"
    # server2.socket_port = 8081
    # server2.thread_pool = 30
    # server2.subscribe()

    # Start the server engine (Option 1 *and* 2)

    cherrypy.engine.start()
    cherrypy.engine.block()
</code></pre>
<p>Save and exit again by pressing CTRL+X and confirming with Y.</p>

<p>Finally, this is how your main application deployment directory should look like:</p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">my_app              # Main Folder to Contain Everything Together
  |
  |=== my_app_venv  # V. Env. folder with the Python Int.
  |=== app          # Your application module
  |
  |--- wsgi.py      # File containing application callable
  |--- server.py    # Python executable to launch the server
  |..
  |.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="running-the-server">Running the server</h3>

<hr/>

<p>To start serving your application, you just need to execute server.py using your Python installation.</p>

<p>Run the following to start the server as configured:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This will execute the script, using the activated Python interpreter because we are still working within the virtual environment. If it is not activated, you will need to state the path: <strong><em>my</em>app/bin/python_ server.py</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">python server.py
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This will run the server on the foreground. If you would like to stop it, press CTRL+C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To run the server in the background, run the following:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">python server.py &amp;
</code></pre>
<p>To return to the command line, just press enter. The app will still be running. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you run an application in the background, you will need to use a process manager (e.g. htop) to kill (or stop) it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="configuring-nginx">Configuring Nginx</h2>

<hr/>

<p>After setting up CherryPy to run our application, we now need to do the same with Nginx for it to talk with the CherryPy server(s). For this, we need to modify Nginx's configuration file: “nginx.conf”</p>

<p><strong>Run the following command to open up nginx.conf and edit it using nano text editor:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-pre "><code langs="">sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Afterwards, you can replace the file with the following example configuration to get Nginx work as a reverse-proxy, talking to your application.</p>

<blockquote>
