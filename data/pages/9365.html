                    <p>I'll admit it, I love a good rant. I respect those who can give rants well. I would list the ones I really like, but I'm not sure I want to deal with the arguments that would follow. ;-)</p>
<p>Of course, as much as I like to read or listen to them, I also like to give them. As of 11/26/2012 there are 2 on this <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/tag/rant.html">blog</a> and 26 on my <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.blogspot.com/search/label/rant">old blog</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have a problem in giving rants. It ties with this unfortunate trait I possess where if I let myself get angry I say things that destroy relationships. No, I'm not giving examples, but there you are.</p>
<p>So when I do rant, I try to never do so in anger. Especially when it's the written word. Instead, I try to do so under one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I need to be a whimsical mood.</li>
<li>OR I need to be willing to submit a solution.</li>
<li>OR I need to be willing to accept a solution, even if it means work.</li>
<li>OR I need to be willing to create a solution.</li>
<li>OR the object of the rant must be an easy target to flame.</li>
</ul>
