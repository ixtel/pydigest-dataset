<p>The usage of <code>xrange()</code> is very popular in Python 2.x for creating an iterable object, e.g., in a for-loop or list/set-dictionary-comprehension.<br/>
The behavior was quite similar to a generator (i.e., "lazy evaluation"), but here the xrange-iterable is not exhaustible - meaning, you could iterate over it infinitely.</p>
<p>Thanks to its "lazy-evaluation", the advantage of the regular <code>range()</code> is that <code>xrange()</code> is generally faster if you have to iterate over it only once (e.g., in a for-loop). However, in contrast to 1-time iterations, it is not recommended if you repeat the iteration multiple times, since the generation happens every time from scratch!</p>
<p>In Python 3, the <code>range()</code> was implemented like the <code>xrange()</code> function so that a dedicated <code>xrange()</code> function does not exist anymore (<code>xrange()</code> raises a <code>NameError</code> in Python 3).</p>
