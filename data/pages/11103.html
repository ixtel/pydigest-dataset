<p>As far as I am concerned, there is no such direct tool in PyCharm. There are, however, 3rd party tools for this.</p>

<h1><code>.pyi</code> generators</h1>



<p>Yes, I guess anyone who wants to use compile-time type checking in Python, probably ends up using MyPy. MyPy contains <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/stubgen.py" rel="nofollow" title="stubgen.py on Github">stubgen.py</a> tool which generates <code>.pyi</code> files.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>(all from docs in stubgen.py file)</p>

<pre><code>mkdir out
stubgen urllib.parse
</code></pre>

<p>generates <code>out/urllib/parse.pyi</code>.</p>

<p>You can use it for python2 too:</p>

<pre><code>stubgen --py2 textwrap
</code></pre>

<p>or for C modules:</p>

<pre><code>scripts/stubgen --docpath &lt;DIR&gt;/Python-3.4.2/Doc/library curses
</code></pre>



<p>This project is dedicated to exactly this goal.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>A very basic one (but it has a handful of options, just consult <code>README.md</code> or <code>make_stub_files -h</code></p>

<pre><code>make_stub_files foo.py
</code></pre>

<h1>pre-written <code>.pyi</code> files</h1>

<p>So you don't have to write your own.</p>



<p>Yes, if you're using <code>.pyi</code> files in your own project, you probably want to use this also when using external code. Typeshed contains <code>.pyi</code> files for Python2 and Python3 stdlib and a bunch of Python2 libraries (like <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/third_party/2.7/redis" rel="nofollow">redis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/third_party/2.7/Crypto" rel="nofollow">crypto</a>, <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/third_party/2.7/requests" rel="nofollow">requests</a>...) and some Python3 libraries (like <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/third_party/3/lxml" rel="nofollow">lxml</a> or <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/third_party/3/requests" rel="nofollow">requests</a>), all nicely versioned.</p>

<h1>PyCharm alternatives to <code>.pyi</code> files</h1>

<p>In case you're lazy, or simply just working on a project which doesn't require <code>.pyi</code> files and you don't want to be bothered by using 3rd party tools, PyCharm allows you to use:</p>
