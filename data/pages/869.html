PyDev 3.5.0 is now available...</p>
<p>
The main feature in this release relates to improvements to work with </p><a href="http://pytest.org/">py.test</a><p> (note: those that want to use it have to enable it in the PyUnit preferences -- besides having to install it properly in the used Python installation).
</p><p>
Mainly, the integration was changed so that the </p><b>py.test xdist</b><p> plugin can be properly used and module/session scoped fixtures should also work properly. The PyUnit UI in the preferences was also changed to show the preferences related to py.test when it's shown.
</p><p>
Still, there are other improvements: the </p><b>Model.objects</b><p> from django 1.7 is now available on code-completion again (as the static analyzer couldn't cope with it there are workarounds in the code), private attributes (those starting with </p><b>'__'</b><p>) are now shown when hovering over it on the debugger and there's a bunch of other bug-fixes and minor features available (see </p><a href="http://pydev.org/">http://pydev.org</a><p> for details).
</p><p>
Also, for those that don't know, there's an ongoing crowdfunding to keep PyDev support going on: </p><a href="http://tiny.cc/pydev-2014">http://tiny.cc/pydev-2014</a><p>...
