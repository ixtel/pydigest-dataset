                    <p>Tarek Ziade has a habit of ending the year with a Python-themed meme. I've matched his meme the times he previousstarted it, and as you can tell from the title of this blog post I'm matching him yet again.</p>

<h2>1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2012?</h2>
<p>This question took some thought. It was a toss-up between these three choices:</p>

<p>The winner?</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Django Class Based Views</strong></blockquote>
<p>In 2012 what I managed to accomplish with Django CBVs was incredible. From early self-instructional work I did for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydanny/django-mongonaut/blob/master/mongonaut/views.py">django-mongonaut</a>, to client efforts and personal projects where I honed my craft, plus examples <a class="reference external" href="http://pydanny.com/tag/class-based-views.html">I blogged about</a> or helped get into Django core, it made for a great year. Also I wasn't just productive personally, I helped increased the productivity of others around the world.</p>
<p>And you ain't seen nothing yet!</p>

<h2>2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012?</h2>
<p>I thought I understood multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>I really did.</p>
<p>However, since the start of this year I've delved really deep into it, only to discover just how much I didn't know. While that didn't do my ego any favors, it was a nice refreshing reminder not to get arrogant about one's skills.</p>

<div class="section" id="which-open-source-project-did-you-contribute-to-the-most-in-2012-what-did-you-do">
<h2>3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What did you do?</h2>
<p>The answer to this is <strong>Django</strong>.</p>
<p>After using Django professionally for 2.5 years, I finally began contributing to the core framework at the DjangoCon Eu 2012 sprints. I joined a group of other dedicated people who decided to improve the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/">Django CBV documentation</a>, our goal being setting a new standard for documentation. I'm not sure if we set a new bar in documentation, but we did improve on the existing material.</p>
<p>I branched out into some other areas of core Django development with mixed results, which played out that way because I just didn't have the time to do more.</p>

<h2>5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013?</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<h2>6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2013?</h2>
<p>I've got a couple:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A Python SDK that produces results that work perfectly for both modern iOS and Android. Think Corona SDK but with Python.</li>
<li>A modern PyGame release that installs trivially on Mac OS X.</li>
</ul>
