<p>When deploying to elastic beanstalk I keep getting the error:</p>

<pre><code>Partial import of sklearn during the build process.
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    File "/tmp/pip-build-Le610u/scikit-learn/setup.py", line 247, in &lt;module&gt;
      setup_package()
    File "/tmp/pip-build-Le610u/scikit-learn/setup.py", line 237, in setup_package
      .format(scipy_req_str, instructions))
  ImportError: Scientific Python (SciPy) is not installed.
  scikit-learn requires SciPy &gt;= 0.9.
  Installation instructions are available on the scikit-learn website: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
</code></pre>

<p>My requirements.txt has both scikit-learn and scipy in it.</p>

<p>Why is this occurring? I don't want to be installing packages manually, and was under the impression pip would sort out the installation order for me (it's currently trying to install scikit-learn before scipy). It might be worth noting the same requirements.txt works perfectly fine on my local computer.</p>

<p>What can I do to fix this?</p>

<p>Edit: If I change the order of the entries in requirements.txt so scipy is above scikit-learn, it works just fine. I'd still like to know why this fails the other way around though, since pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt will override it with alphabetical ordering.</p>
