<p>Coming back to the nice practice of release my own <strong>IPython</strong> <em>nbextensions</em>, today I will release two extensions I use a lot in my daily workflow: <code>loader</code> and <code>writer</code>, useful extensions to load files into the <strong>IPython notebook</strong> and to write the content to the same (or another) file.
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These extensions were developed some months ago, and probably you can write better versions of them using the new IPython widget infrastructure, but these were nice <code>hacks</code> and they are still useful in th IPython 1.x and 2.x series, so I think they deserve to go public.</p>
<p>I used the <strong>IPython notebook</strong> a lot, you know that if you are frequently reading my blog. Not only to write blog posts, but also to write other kind of stuff, for instance: code. Some time ago, I used to write code in a plain text editor next to an IPython console, sometimes I used <a href="http://ninja-ide.org/"><strong>NINJA-IDE</strong></a> because it is a nice and featured platform. But right now, I am developing inside the <strong>IPython notebook</strong> because it gives me the text editor and the console in one place, with a lot of other useful features. But I will postpone the description of my workflow for some post to come in the future. </p>
<p>I just want to tell you how I easily fixed a missing feature (for now, because it will be present in the future, for sure) in the <strong>IPython notebook</strong> using <em>nbextensions</em>. The problem was simple, you can use the <code>%load</code> and <code>%write_file</code> magics to load and write files. But I want some minimal user inteface to:</p>
<ol>
<li>select which file to load,</li>
<li>write a cell content to a file with just a click.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I wrote <code>loader</code> and <code>writer</code>...</p>
<p><code>loader</code> <em>nbextension</em> use <code>FileReader()</code> capability of modern browsers. The implementation is simple and you can find more complex examples on the web:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">loadFileAsText</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">var</span> fileToLoad = document.getElementById(<span class="string">"fileToLoad_"</span> + i).files[<span class="number">0</span>];
    <span class="keyword">var</span> fileReader = <span class="keyword">new</span> FileReader();
    fileReader.onload = <span class="keyword">function</span>(fileLoadedEvent) {
        <span class="keyword">var</span> textFromFileLoaded = fileLoadedEvent.target.result;
        IPython.notebook.get_selected_cell().set_text(<span class="string">'name: '</span> + fileToLoad.name + <span class="string">'\n'</span> +
                                                      <span class="string">'type: '</span> + fileToLoad.type + <span class="string">'\n'</span> +
                                                      <span class="string">'size: '</span> + fileToLoad.size + <span class="string">' bytes \n'</span> +
                                                      <span class="string">'---- \n'</span> + textFromFileLoaded);
    };
    fileReader.readAsText(fileToLoad, <span class="string">"UTF-8"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>So after selecting a cell, I click on the <code>loader</code> button, I get this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.damian.oquanta.info/galleries/loadwrite/loader1.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>And if I click on <em>Seleccionar archivo</em> (Select file) I can navigate trough my file system to get the file I want to load. For instance, I will load some text, in this case a <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/"><strong>Bokeh</strong></a> plot, in the next cell:</p>
