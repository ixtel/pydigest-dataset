<h3>OK, I think I get the idea, but what is it good for?</h3>
<p><strong>kaoru</strong>’s purpose in life is to make your life a little bit easier by
allowing you remote control of certain things on your host(s), the rationale
behind this is that there could be moments in which you would need to perform
administrative tasks on either your office or home laptop, things that you
maybe forgot to do, or things you could only do by getting in front of them.
An IoT-like approach would be ideal on this scenario, namely, talk to your
machines and tell them to do stuff for you while you’re walking streets,
or having a dinner with your friend, or when you’re just too sleepy/lazy
to get up from your couch/bed.</p>
<p>For the moment, <strong>kaoru</strong> is capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebooting your host(s)</li>
<li>Shutting down your host(s)</li>
<li>Locking the screen on your host(s)</li>
<li>Send screen shots from your host(s)</li>
<li>Suspending your host(s) to either RAM or disk</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I feel tempted to implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send alerts/warnings on certain things happening in your host(s)</li>
<li>Tell your host(s) to send you a file in their file system.</li>
<li>Perform a <tt>tail</tt> on a file and send messages as new content is appended to that file.</li>
</ul>

<div id="wait-what-bots-are-sort-of-public-domain-you-know">
<h3>Wait, what?, bots are sort-of public domain, you know?</h3>
<p>While that’s true, the fact is that having your host running <strong>kaoru</strong>
means that you have control over <em>her</em>, including (but not limited) to
control which people she’s going to listen to, as explained in <a href="#security" rel="nofollow">Security</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="ok-i-get-it-how-do-i-use-this-i-just-wanna-get-hands-on-this-thing">
<h3>OK, I get it, how do I use this?, I just wanna get hands-on this “thing” …</h3>
<p>Well, the most essential thing you will need is to tell <a href="http://telegram.me/botfather" rel="nofollow">@BotFather</a> to
make a new bot for you, as specified in <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots" rel="nofollow">Telegram Bots Documentation</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, you gotta install <strong>kaoru</strong>, of course.</p>
<pre><span class="c1"># First of all, you need to install
</span>pip3 install kaoru
</pre>
<p>A Telegram Bot is a just a dummy client with no cell phone attached to it,
you need something to control this bot so it can become active, and that’s when
<strong>kaoru</strong> comes into play.</p>
<p>Make sure you have properly set up your brand new Telegram Bot, <a href="http://telegram.me/botfather" rel="nofollow">@BotFather</a>
should have given you an <strong>API access token</strong> (a bunch of characters and numbers),
<strong>kaoru</strong> needs this token in order for her to do her magic.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can edit your <a href="#configuration-file" rel="nofollow">configuration file</a> from this point</p>
<pre>$ vi /path/to/your/kaoru.conf
</pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A configuration file is <em>not mandatory</em> for <strong>kaoru</strong> to run, she can do
it using her defaults, however, you will need at least to set the API token
through the environment variable <tt>TG_TOKEN</tt></p>
<p><strong>Now you are done setting up kaoru, now is time to run it!</strong></p>
<pre>$ kaoru --config /path/to/you/kaoru.conf

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: bear in mind that <strong>you have to register kaoru’s commands for your bot</strong>
with the <a href="http://telegram.me/botfather" rel="nofollow">@BotFather</a>, <strong>kaoru</strong> will tell you how.</p>
<p><strong>So, I have everything set up. What commands are available on this bot?</strong></p>
<p>Good question indeed!, the following is the current set of commands
supported by <strong>kaoru</strong>, more are planned to come:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>/hello</tt> A simple ping just to see if your bot is <em>alive</em></li>
<li><tt>/help</tt> How to use <strong>kaoru</strong></li>
<li><tt>/screenlock</tt> Lock screens on your host(s)</li>
<li><tt>/screenshot</tt> Get a screen shot from your host(s)</li>
<li><tt>/poweroff</tt> Tell your host(s) to shut down</li>
<li><tt>/reboot</tt> Tell your host(s) to reboot</li>
<li><tt>/cancel</tt> Cancel any pending operations</li>
<li><tt>/dryrun</tt> don’t do a thing, but pretend</li>
<li><tt>/about</tt> information, mostly for nerds</li>
<li><tt>/suspend</tt> Suspend your host(s) to RAM</li>
