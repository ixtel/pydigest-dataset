<p>From <a href="http://www.sample-videos.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> download this <a href="http://www.sample-videos.com/video/mp4/720/big_buck_bunny_720p_5mb.mp4" rel="nofollow">video</a> so we have the same video file for the test. Make sure to have that mp4 file in the same directory of your python code. Then also make sure to run the python interpreter from the same directory.</p>

<p>Then modify the code, ditch <code>waitKey</code> that's wasting time also without a window it cannot capture the keyboard events. Also we print the <code>success</code> value to make sure it's reading the frames successfully.</p>

<pre><code>import cv2
vidcap = cv2.VideoCapture('big_buck_bunny_720p_5mb.mp4')
success,image = vidcap.read()
count = 0
success = True
while success:
  success,image = vidcap.read()
  print 'Read a new frame: ', success
  cv2.imwrite("frame%d.jpg" % count, image)     # save frame as JPEG file
  count += 1
</code></pre>

<p>How does that go?</p>
