<html><body><div><div class="article-content"><p><strong>tldr:</strong> If you don't have the time to read the entire post, just read <a class="reference internal" href="#productivity-guide">Productivity Guide</a>, because I assume that you want better productivity as your primary goal.</p><p>PyCharm is a very powerful IDE, and has a multitude of features that keep growing at a large pace. PyCharm is essentially, a plugin built on top of the IntelliJ platform, Jetbrains' main IDE. Because PyCharm borrows from a whole host of features available from IntelliJ, its easy to get lost. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#jb" id="id1">[1]</a></p><p>This post shows you some of the best features that PyCharm has to offer, and how to use those features properly. I assume that you've installed plugins and know your way around the IDE. The table of contents should give you an idea of what is covered in this post.</p><div class="section" id="productivity-guide"><p>You might not know this, but PyCharm tracks what features you use, and tells you how productive you are being in your productivity guide:</p><img alt="How to get to the productivity guide" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_01.png"/><p>The productivity guide gives you detailed descriptions of what features can help you code faster. You can see below that although I don't use all the features, I do use some quite a lot:</p><img alt="What features the Productivity guide I use" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_02.png"/></div><div class="section" id="starting-out"><p>PyCharm touts its project creation wizard a lot, and for Windows users is a godsend because you can easily create a project and associate a virtualenv with it. However for *nix users, the best option is to start PyCharm from the command line, and you can do this by creating a command line launcher:</p><img alt="Command Line Launcher" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_08.png"/><p>There is one thing that you need to know about starting from the command line is that PyCharm uses the interpreter that the <code>python</code> command is linked to. So for example, if your <code>python</code> command in the shell links to <code>/usr/bin/python</code>, then that interpreter will become the interpreter for your new project. However, if you want to have the interpreter as a virtualenv, you have to create the virtualenv, activate it and then use the command line launcher to initialize your project. If we do the following:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir SimpleProjectDir
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>SimpleProjectDir
<span class="nv">$ </span>charm .
</pre></div><p>It would create a PyCharm project in <code>SimpleProjectDir</code> and use the default interpreter in the shell like so:</p><img alt="Bad Interpreter" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_09.png"/><p>We can see that it is the same <code>python</code> that was linked to in our shell:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>which python
/usr/local/bin/python
</pre></div><p>However, if we were to create a virtualenv beforehand and then create a project using the command line launcher, we would get the virtualenv as the interpreter instead:</p><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir SimpleProjectDir
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>SimpleProjectDir
<span class="nv">$ </span>virtualenv .venv
New python executable in .venv/bin/python2.7
Also creating executable in .venv/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip...done.

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> .venv/bin/activate
<span class="o">(</span>.venv<span class="o">)</span><span class="nv">$ </span>charm .
</pre></div><p>In simple terms, whatever <code>python</code> points to in the shell at the time of using the command line launcher, PyCharm will adopt that interpreter as the project interpreter.</p></div><div class="section" id="keyboard-shortcuts"><div class="section" id="keymap"><p>PyCharm allows you to see all your keyboard shortcuts using the <em>Keymap</em>. <em>Keymap</em> has two key features which aid in development. One being the ability to find keyboard shortcuts based on what they're called:</p><img alt="Finding the Keymap based on what you are searching for" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_04.png"/><p>But it also allows you to find shortcuts based on the keys themselves, so that you can talk other people about them:</p><p class="external youtube"/><p>So, whenever I talk about an action like "Find Action" or "Search Anywhere", just search it up on your keymap to see the corresponding keyboard shortcut.</p></div><div class="section" id="find-action"><p>The best way to learn Keyboard shortcuts is to use <em>Find Action</em>. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#findaction" id="id2">[2]</a> Every time you use an action using find action, the keyboard shortcut is also denoted on the right:</p><img alt="Shortcuts in Find Action" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_03.png"/><p>Whatever you find yourself using over and over again through <em>Find Action</em>, just commit it to memory and you'll be saving yourself some time.</p></div><div class="section" id="useful-shortcuts"><p>Use the Keymap to find what shortcuts these commands refer to: <a class="footnote-reference" href="#cantfind" id="id3">[3]</a></p><ul class="simple"><li><strong>Find Action</strong></li><li><strong>Search Everywhere</strong></li><li>Find</li><li>Structure</li><li>Add Selection for Next Occurrence</li><li>Switcher</li><li>Check In Project</li><li>Syntax Aware Selection</li><li>New</li></ul><p>The first two features are must use shortcuts, and will aid you in learning more shortcuts as you see fit. The others are shortcuts I use regularly, and find helpful.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="navigation"><p>This section covers how to get from place to place. I've divided it into two sections. One being <a class="reference internal" href="#macro">Macro</a> and the other being <a class="reference internal" href="#micro">Micro</a>. Macro is about moving between files, panels and tools. Micro is about moving from place to place <em>within</em> a file.</p><div class="section" id="macro"><div class="section" id="back-and-forward"><p>This is one of my most favorite features. <em>Back</em> and <em>Forward</em> allows you to go back to the place where your cursor was previously. This is immensely powerful, and allows you to jump between places within files and places between files. Let me demonstrate:</p><p class="external youtube"/></div><div class="section" id="search-everywhere"><p>We need to find stuff all the time like functions, files, classes and methods. The best way to search for classes, files, and directories is to use <em>Search Everywhere</em> (press <kbd class="light">SHIFT</kbd> in quick succession):</p><img alt="Search Everywhere" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_06.png"/></div><div class="section" id="switcher"><p>The other way is to use the <em>Switcher</em>, which gives you quick access to your most recently used panels and files:</p><img alt="The Switcher" class="align-center" src="/images/charm_good_parts_05.png"/></div></div><div class="section" id="micro"><div class="section" id="structure"><p>In order to find things within files, its best to use <em>Find</em>, and for a more structural view, use <em>Structure</em>. The <em>Structure</em> panel gives you a skeletal view of your file, with variables, classes, functions and methods. It allows you to quickly navigate between important structures within your file:</p><p class="external youtube"/></div><div class="section" id="acejump"><p>AceJump is a plugin that allows you to quickly jump from place to place.
