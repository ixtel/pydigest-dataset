<h3>Wing IDE 5.1: January 22, 2015</h3>
</p>
  



<p>Wingware has released version 5.1 of <a class="reference" href="http://wingware.com/">Wing IDE</a>, our
cross-platform integrated development environment for the <a class="reference" href="http://python.org/">Python</a> programming language.</p>
<p>Wing IDE features a professional code editor with vi, emacs, visual studio,
and other key bindings, auto-completion, call tips, context-sensitive
auto-editing, goto-definition, find uses, refactoring, a powerful debugger,
version control, unit testing, search, project management, and many other
features.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title-2">What's New in Wing IDE 5.1</h2>
<p><strong>Multi-process Debugging</strong></p>
<p>Wing Pro can now debug multiple processes at once. By default, Wing will accept
multiple debug connections, showing a process selector wherever a stack
selector is shown in the user interface, in addition to a thread selector if
there are multiple threads in the debug process.  The process selector groups
processes into a process tree, showing the relationship between them regardless
of how they were created or debug-enabled.</p>
<p>You can also ask Wing to automatically debug child processes. This is off by
default since it can be confusing to new users, or unwanted in some code bases,
but can be enabled with the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Debugger</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Processes</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Debug</span> <span class="pre">Child</span> <span class="pre">Processes</span></tt> preference
or the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Debug/Execute</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Debug</span> <span class="pre">Child</span> <span class="pre">Properties</span></tt> setting in <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Project</span> <span class="pre">Properties</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Wing can automatically debug child processes created with the
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">multiprocessing</span></tt> module, with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">os.fork()</span></tt> (on Posix platforms) or
whenever a process is started using <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">sys.executable</span></tt>. In other cases,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">wingdbstub</span></tt> can be used to start debugging in the child process.</p>
<p>Additional features for debug process control are available in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Processes</span></tt>
sub-menu of the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Debug</span></tt> menu and the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Debugger</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Processes</span></tt> preferences group.</p>
<p>More information can be found in <a class="reference" href="/doc/debug/multiprocess">Multi-Process Debugging</a> in the Wing IDE manual.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Python Shell and Debug Probe</strong></p>
<p>The Python Shell and Debug Probe now syntax highlight code, as in the editor.
The shells now also show data value tooltips when the mouse hovers over
symbols.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Testing Tool</strong></p>
<p>The Testing tool in Wing Pro now saves results in the project file, along
with the date the test was last run.</p>

<h2 class="title-2">Compatibility Notes</h2>
<p>Wing 5.1 drops support for Python 3.0 and makes a few other minor changes
listed in the <a class="reference" href="http://wingware.com/pub/wingide/5.1.0/CHANGELOG.txt">change log</a>.</p>
<p>By default, Wing 5.1 will install over your Wing 5.0 installation.  To
avoid this:  On Windows, uncheck the option to remove Wing 5.0 or use the
.zip installer; on Linux use the tar file installer; on OS X, unpack the
OS X disk image to a location other than your Applications folder.</p>
<p>Wing 5.1 and 5.0 can share project files, but we recommend backing up your
projects if you plan to move back and forth between the two versions.</p>
