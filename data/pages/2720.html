<h1>New Django Website<a class="headerlink" href="#new-django-website" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><strong>After a series of Django gigs in 2014, I had the urge to redevelop our company website in Django; I am very happy with the results.</strong></p>
<p>This overview is roughly in order of development from start to finish. And since I am a “packaging guy”, I will take this opportunity to comment on miscellaneous packaging issues too*.</p>

<div class="section" id="same-theme-different-backend">
<h2>Same theme, different backend<a class="headerlink" href="#same-theme-different-backend" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Pyramid version of aclark.net was almost two years old and needed an overhaul. Django appeared attractive because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I know Django, but I don’t know enough Django. Like with Pyramid and Plone before, I learned a lot of Django while developing this site over the last few weeks.</li>
<li>There was no “content” with the previous (Pyramid) site. The idea of putting my “content” in Django models was appealing to me.</li>
<li>The new <a class="reference external" href="https://djangoproject.com">Django project</a> website is awesome! An awesome website makes me want to build another awesome website with an awesome web framework. Awesome.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="i-hate-code-generators">
<h2>I hate code generators<a class="headerlink" href="#i-hate-code-generators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I typically hate using code generators, full stop. But somehow Django’s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">startproject</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">startapp</span></code> don’t make me want to vomit. So I used them in an organic <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id1">[1]</a> way, to make some <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclarknet-django/tree/master/aclarknet/aclarknet/aclarknet">obnoxiously long package names</a>, and I <em>miraculously</em> don’t hate the results! This can only mean:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I am more tolerant of boilerplate code when learning a new framework, and/or:</li>
<li>The process of creating the boilerplate code and the resulting boilerplate are so elegant/minimalistic that my insatiable desire for elegance/minimalism is at least partially satisified.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="no-postgres-no-problem">
<h2>No Postgres? No problem<a class="headerlink" href="#no-postgres-no-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea of having to develop locally with Postgresql (or some other “real” database) feels “heavy” to me. With sqlite, I don’t have to worry about database setup until I’m ready to worry about database setup <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>I even pushed to Heroku with the sqlite database checked in, until I was ready to deploy Postgres. And I still use sqlite locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bootstrap-all-the-things">
<h2>Bootstrap all the things<a class="headerlink" href="#bootstrap-all-the-things" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sure Bootstrap is ubiquitious now, but it remains attractive nonetheless. One of the first tasks I performed was add <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django-admin-bootstrapped</span></code> to my <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">INSTALLED_APPS</span></code> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>And because it’s 2015, I Bower-installed Bootstrap and Fontawesome for my theme development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-like-a-tree-and-file">
<h2>Make like a tree and file<a class="headerlink" href="#make-like-a-tree-and-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Lately I’ve gotten into the habit of using good-ol’ Make to automate various tasks <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id4">[4]</a>. This project was no exception:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>dump:
    curl -o latest.dump `heroku pgbackups:url`
push:
    git push
    git push heroku master
sync:
    heroku run python aclarknet/manage.py syncdb
publish:
    git commit -a -m "Update"
</pre></div>

<div class="section" id="add-ons-apps-eggs-distributions-packages-products-wheels">
<h2>Add-ons, Apps, Eggs, Distributions, Packages, Products, Wheels<a class="headerlink" href="#add-ons-apps-eggs-distributions-packages-products-wheels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I am <em>literally</em> annoyed by the <em>figurative</em> abomination that is Python packaging terminology. The proliferation of terms is understandable though because of the many layers of <em>technology</em>, each with its own <em>terminology</em>, that may or may not overlap:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Python language</li>
<li>Various packaging frameworks</li>
<li>Software written in Python</li>
</ul>
<p>And all of that was just so I could tell you I pip-installed the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span/>Django
Pillow
django-admin-bootstrapped
django-cumulus
dj-database-url
dj-static
gunicorn
psycopg2
-e aclarknet
</pre></div>
</div>

<h2>Buildout, Conda, easy_install, pip<a class="headerlink" href="#buildout-conda-easy-install-pip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On a related subject, why do I have a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ACLARKNET/aclarknet-django/blob/master/aclarknet/setup.py">setup.py</a>? I get the feeling that Django projects in the wild sometimes have one and sometimes don’t. And the Django documentation <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/search/?q=setup+py&amp;release=11">has only a few mentions of setup.py</a>. So why do I have one?</p>
<p>In short, because I want my code in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys.path</span></code>. I have another feeling that when Django projects/apps/etc don’t have setup.py files, they are somehow manipulating sys.path manually to include themselves. There is <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/search/?q=sys+path&amp;release=11">slightly more mentioning of sys.path</a> in Django’s documentation, at least.</p>
<p>Anyway, I use setup.py because I’m familiar with setuptools.</p>

<div class="section" id="orm-i-really-on-my-own">
<h2>ORM I really on my own?<a class="headerlink" href="#orm-i-really-on-my-own" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://twitter.com/aclark4life/status/552626214008274944"><img alt="Tweet" class="img-thumbnail align-center" src="../../../../_images/aclark-tweet.png"/></a>
<p>That’s right. After adding an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ImageField</span></code> I expected the image to be stored in the database and not the file system, and I’m not ashamed. Since that was not the case, I ended up using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django-cumulus</span></code> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id6">[6]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="overall">
<h2>Overall<a class="headerlink" href="#overall" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Overall, this was a great experience. As such, I’m now considering another <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonpackages.com">pythonpackages.com</a> reboot with Django; to further exercise my Django chops and fullfill the packaging-automation-vision I’ve had since late 2011.</p>
