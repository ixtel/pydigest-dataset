<h2>Django 1.9 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on December 1, 2015 </span>

<p>After 10 and a half months of development, the Django team is happy to announce the release of Django 1.9.</p>
<p>As always, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/1.9/">the release notes</a> cover everything in-depth, but the major highlights are:</p>

<p>You can get Django 1.9 from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a> or from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.9">the Python Package Index</a>. The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
<p>Django 1.9 will receive fixes for security issues, data loss bugs, crashing bugs, major functionality bugs in newly-introduced features, and regressions from older versions of Django for eight months until August 2016. Fixes for security issues and data loss bugs will be provided for another eight months until April 2017.</p>
<p>With the release of Django 1.9, Django 1.7 has reached end-of-life. Django 1.7.11 is the final release of the 1.7 series and all users are encouraged to upgrade to Django 1.8+ as soon as possible so they can continue to receive security updates. Django 1.8 LTS will receive security updates until April 2018. Django 1.4 (the previous LTS) reached end of life on October 1, 2015. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions">downloads page</a> for a table of supported versions and the future release schedule.</p>
