<h3>Come learn with us! </h3>

<h3>Why you should use python to build your new project, website, or startup</h3>
<p>Go behind-the-scenes of One Month’s newest class with python and startup expert <a href="https://twitter.com/Eric_Neuman">Eric Neuman</a>. Eric taught himself python in the process of building his first startup, DecisionDesk, where he was the sole technical founder. From 2008 to 2013, he was responsible for building and maintaining the product, managing the engineering team, and designing new features. In that time, the company grew to over a hundred institutional clients worldwide. In 2010 he was selected as one of BusinessWeek's Top 25 Under 25 and in 2013, DecisionDesk was listed as 23 in Entrepreneur Magazine's 'Hot 100'.</p>

<p>In this free webinar, we’ll talk to Eric about why Python (and Django) is the perfect tool to use to build your next business, project, or website. He’ll also showcase a preview of the class itself, and his next startup — which has everything to do with coffee, python, and finding great places to work.</p>
