This is a nifty trick when working with PyDev...</p>
<p>
When you're writing docstrings it's usually pretty annoying having to manually wrap the contents of the string to fix inside a proper number of columns: say your standard is 80 columns and you've just written 5 lines of comments to fit in that, then, you decide to edit and add something in the middle: there it goes: you have to reindent all the lines below so that the block is nice again.
</p><p>
Well, PyDev has an utility for that: put your cursor on that block and do </p><b>Ctrl+2, W</b><p> (i.e.: press </p><b>Ctrl+2</b><p> and type the char </p><b>W</b><p> later on). Doing that will fix your comment block to fit in the number of columns available (note that it works for code in docstrings and comments alike).
</p><p>
To give an example, say you have the code below:

</p>
<p>
Just place the cursor in the block, use </p><b>Ctrl+2, W</b><p> and voila, you get:

</p>
<p>
Hope PyDev users enjoy the trick (aligning those manually is definitely on the annoying group).
</p><p>
As a note, to configure the number of columns to be wrapped to go to </p><b>preferences &gt; general &gt; editors &gt; text editors</b><p> and change the '</p><b>print margin column</b><p>'.
</p><p>
To finish, </p><b>Ctrl+2</b><p> has other interesting things (if you just press </p><b>Ctrl+2</b><p> and wait a bit, a popup with the options will appear).
