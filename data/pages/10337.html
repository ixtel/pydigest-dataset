							<p>In my previous Webinar, I gave a brief introduction to data science, and showed how we can use the basics of NumPy and Pandas to load data and perform basic calculations. In this Webinar, we'll take the next step — reading data into Pandas, pruning the data that isn't of interest to us,combining data from different sources, and then producing reports — numeric and graphical — that will help us to draw conclusions. There will be numerous demonstrations of how to use Pandas and Matplotlib, and how they can be integrated into IPython Notebook (aka Jupyter) for live documents that allow us to explore data interactively, in order to find the useful insights hiding in our data. Following my presentation, there will be ample time for Q&amp;A.<br/></p>
