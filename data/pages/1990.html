After being dubbed “sexiest job of the 21st Century” by <a href="http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/ar/1" target="_blank"><i>Harvard Business Review</i>,</a> data scientists have stirred the interest of the general public. Many people are intrigued by this job, namely because the name has an interesting ring to it. But it is exactly the name that also raises a lot of questions. Because <strong>what is a data scientist and what do data scientists do exactly?</strong> Many of us who devote their lives to data science have frequently been confronted with questions like these.
The answers to these questions are mostly not as straightforward as you would expect: a short search on Google with the string of words “How to become a data scientist” shows that <strong>the concept has different meanings to different people</strong>. In addition, many articles indeed suggest various tools, courses and applications for people to become a data scientist, and with good reason: the options are unlimited. But let’s face it, for someone that is not familiar with the field, this advice may sometimes seem like a jungle of information. What’s more, they could work demotivating: the descriptions are sometimes fearfully long and the many details often hit the readers as an overwhelming avalanche.</p>
