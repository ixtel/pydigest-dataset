			<p>At The Software Guild, we build our foundation on two of the most critical program languages used today: Java and .NET/C#. These languages serve to support some of the biggest companies in the world, including Facebook, Twitter, Amazon and eBay. At The Software Guild, we are in the business of business, teaching our apprentices the languages they need to know to get, and keep, jobs in a number of industries.</p>
<p>Java and .NET/C# are stable, proven, and in high demand. Not only are these languages proven, but they continue to grow. As companies move out of the start-up phase and into long-term growth, they need the languages that will scale with them. That’s where these languages, and your skills, are so critical.</p>
<p>In addition to being in demand, learning these languages also gives you flexibility. Java and C# are both based on the C language, so your skills are easily transferable between both stacks as well as c++ and objective-c. At The Software Guild, you won’t just become proficient at coding; you will be taught how to learn the languages, meaning you can keep your skills fresh long after you graduate.</p>
