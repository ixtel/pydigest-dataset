<p>Python to JavaScript transpiler, supporting multiple inheritance and generating lean, highly readable code</p>








<p>Transcrypt is a tool to precompile a fairly extensive subset of Python into compact, readable Javascript. It has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows for classical OO programming with <em>multiple inheritance</em> using pure Python syntax, parsed by CPython’s native parser</li>
<li>Seamless integration with the universe of high-quality web-oriented JavaScript libraries, rather than the desktop-oriented Python ones</li>
<li>Hierarchical URL based module system to prevent name conflicts</li>
<li>Simple relation between Python source and generated JavaScript code for easy debugging</li>
<li>Compact downloads, kB’s rather than MB’s</li>
<li>Lightning fast JavaScript code, using memoization (call caching) to optionally bypass the prototype lookup chain</li>
<li>Operator overloading can be switched on and off locally to facilitate use for numerical math that’s both readable and efficient</li>
</ul>
<div id="request-to-early-adopters">
<h2>Request to early adopters</h2>
<p>Transcrypt is in Alpha now!
As you may have already discovered, it is lean, fast, generates highly readable JavaScript, covers most of Python, including stuff like multiple inheritance, properties, tuple assignment, **kwargs and *args, and it cooperates seamlessly with any JavaScript library.
The first version will be 3.5, not for marketing reasons, but to make clear what is the matching version of CPython.</p>
<p>While work on Transcrypt will continue, what’s most important now for Transcrypt to become a permanent, well-maintained asset for the programmer community is mindshare!
This can only be achieved with your help.
Do you think it deserves a lasting place under the sun?
Do you want it to be at your disposal, evolve and have an active community to answer your questions?
Then let the world know it exists!
Do you know someone who can blog about it?
Please ask that person to do so…
Want to show your discovery to your colleagues, classmates or friends?
Go ahead…</p>
<p>For me this is about having pleasure in ones job. I’ve enjoyed laying the groundwork for Transcrypt. And I hope many will enjoy using it.</p>

<h2>Documentation with code examples and forum</h2>
<p>Take a look at the growing documentation with code examples at the Transcrypt website: <a href="http://www.transcrypt.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.transcrypt.org</a>
Some people have contacted me personally with ‘howto’ questions and feature requests. While that’s quite alright, if you want others to benefit from the answers, use the forum: <a href="http://transcrypt.boards.net" rel="nofollow">http://transcrypt.boards.net</a> .</p>
</div>
<div id="status">
<h2>Status</h2>
<ul>
<li>MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN ADDED THAT SURPASS THE ORIGINAL GOALS, all with the “lean and mean” credo in mind: fastcalls, optional local operator overloading and static checks.</li>
<li>The fabric.js library has been encapsulated as a Transcrypt module. Seamless JavaScript integration is a fact now.</li>
<li>Working Pong example added to <a href="http://www.transcrypt.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.transcrypt.org</a> and to the distribution.</li>
<li>ALL THE PLANNED FEATURES ARE NOW AVAILABLE. Those were: functions incl. lambda’s, classes, multiple inheritance, dynamic typing, tuples, lists incl. comprehensions, properties, dicts, sets, modules. But there’s a lot more (see docs). Development of Transcrypt has gone much faster than anticipated. Automated back-to-back regression testing with CPython has proven of key value. If new features are added, establishing that nothing has fallen over is a matter of seconds. This will allow Transcrypt to keep up with developments in the future. While Transcrypt still alpha, it’s almost ready to occupy its niche between PyJs, Py2Js, RapydScript, Brython, Flexx, PyPyJs or any similar excellent projects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-s-new">
<h2>What’s new</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dict omissions and bugs fixed and added to autotest, .gitignore recovered</li>
<li>Overloading of () added + test</li>
<li>Optional overloading of [] enabled, doc updated, tests added</li>
<li>Doc update, operator overloading and sort/sorted examples added</li>
<li>Optional operator overloading added, -o (–opov) option, __pragma__ (‘opov’) and __pragma__ (‘noopov’), currently supporting * / + - @ (MatMult). USE ONLY LOCALLY in Matrix/vector intensive code parts to maintain performance. The commandline switch I’d never use, but alas, it’s there for symetry reasons. Testcases added.</li>
<li>-c (–check) option added, triggering static source code checks by PyFlakes, that’s included in the distribution and automatically invoked</li>
<li>__pragma__ (‘skip’) and __pragma__ (‘noskip’) added to skip code generation for certain fragments</li>
<li>-j (–jskeys) option added. Normally in Python {key: ‘value’} and {keyfunc (): ‘value’} are allowed, and the keys are dynamically evaluated. JS programmers are used to {key, ‘value’} being interpreted as {‘key’: ‘value’} and {keyfunc (): ‘value’} being forbidden. The Python interpretation is preferred, since its more flexible. If you cherish your JS habits, use the –jskeys switch. Note that this has no influence on compatibility with 3rd party JS libs.</li>
<li>FastCall (fcall) command line switch, __pragma__ (‘fcall’) and __pragma__ (‘nofcall’) added. When this switch is on, Transcrypt will bind methods directly to objects rather than to prototypes somewhere up in the class hierarchy, surpassing native JavaScript speed in many cases, since no travelling of the prototype chain is needed. Since a reference to the bound method is stored in each object of that class, the most efficient thing to do is to reserve its use for functions that are called in inner loops, achieving for lightning fast code with negligeable space overhead. The fcall mechanism has no semantical or syntactical consequences, the syntax remains pure Python.</li>
<li>Linux startup script added (I hope). It doesn’t have an extension, but *. didn’t work, I hope * does…</li>
<li>Startup batches / scripts were missing, added to distro.</li>
<li>Transcrypt can now also run without minification, in case you can’t or won’t install Java. -n switch, see docs.</li>
<li>Simple beginning of a shipment test added, both for Linux and Windows</li>
<li>Docs adapted, identifier filtering replaced by identifier aliasing</li>
<li>Python sort is now a method as it should be, thanks to id aliasing</li>
<li>__pragma__ (‘alias’) functionality expanded, __pragma__ (‘noalias’) added. NB: Not backwards compatible</li>
<li>Twitter account opened for notification of new versions (see <a href="http://www.transcrypt.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.transcrypt.org</a>)</li>
<li>Documentation improved on several points.</li>
<li>Everything tested under Linux as well.</li>
<li>Linux support added. Installation and behaviour under Windows and Linux is identical.</li>
<li>Several bugs fixed, e.g. &lt;aString&gt;.format (*args)</li>
<li>Simple jQuery example added</li>
<li>__pragma__ (‘alias’, …) added, e.g. to generate $ from S or jq</li>

<li>Function inheritance bug fixed (ooops…)</li>
<li>Autotest output example added to docs</li>
<li>Docs adapted</li>

<li>Manual tests added in interactive_tests  subdir</li>
<li>A simple start made with an autotest/regressiontest feature. This will REALLY be needed! But Transcrypt first needs to be able to support it…</li>
<li>Transpiler core</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="known-restrictions">
<h2>Known restrictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>No standard libs, use or encapsulate the JS ones, that’s part of the concept. Some may be ported though.</li>
<li>Not all methods of builtin types are there by default. This is deliberately to keep Transcrypt lean. Such things can be distributed in separate libs.</li>
<li>No set or dict comprehensions yet. Should be easy but low priority.</li>
<li>No eval and exec (will stay that way, with minor exceptions)</li>
<li>No threading of any kind. Will probably stay that way as long as JS doesn’t properly support that.</li>
<li>No operator overloading. May be added, but low priority</li>
<li>_name doesn’t mean private in any way</li>
<li>No iterator, generator, xrange stuff. Maybe in the future if JS becomes better at that kind of things</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="known-bugs">
<h2>Known bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>**kwargs lack keys () method, will be added</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="readability">
<h2>Readability</h2>
<p>As can be seen below, there’s a simple parallel between the Python and the JavaScript code.
So it should be easy to debug.
Also, code can be tested from the command prompt using stubs.</p>
