                    <p>New to Python and thinking about going to the upcoming <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon US</a> for the first time? You know, that big <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a> conference taking place near San Francisco in March?</p>
<p>Or perhaps you signed up already and are getting worried about being overwhelmed by hundreds of tutorials, talks, and activities?</p>
<p>No worries! This multi-part guide will aid you in getting the most out of attending one of the best technical conferences on the planet. I'm going to share how to get through the whole event in good shape and cover some incredible beginner friendly events.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-basics">
<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>First off, <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/">register</a> already! PyCon US sold out last year around this time. Don't be left out in the cold. Buy your ticket now before it's too late!</p>
<p>Now that you've got that done, keep in mind that Python has two days of <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/">tutorials</a>, three days of <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/talks/">talks</a>, and four days of <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/">sprints</a>. <strong>Nine days of Python!</strong> The trick is to not get exhausted or sick. Therefore, do the following every day of the conference:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Take at least one shower. Please.</li>
<li>Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different people at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!</li>
<li>Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your brain is going to go into learning overdrive.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, PyCon US also has a <a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>. I like to sum it up as, "Act professionally." Whether or not you agree with codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one and it will be enforced.</p>
<p>Alright, enough basics, let's get onto tutorials!</p>

<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>Tutorials take place on March 13th and 14th. They each cost $150 but are well worth the price. The following are the talks I believe are best suited for beginners.</p>
