<p>Maybe we can speed things up a little bit via <a href="http://cython.org">Cython's C-extensions for Python</a>. Cython is basically a hybrid between C and Python and can be pictured as compiled Python code with type declarations.<br/>
Since we are working in an IPython notebook here, we can make use of the very convenient <em>IPython magic</em>: It will take care of the conversion to C code, the compilation, and eventually the loading of the function.</p>
<p>Note that the static type declarations that we add via <code>cdef</code> are note required for Cython to work, but it will speed things up tremendously.</p>
