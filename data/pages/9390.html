                    <p>I've been very happy with <a class="reference external" href="http://pelican.readthedocs.org/">Pelican</a> as a blog engine so far, and haven't even moved off the sample theme. There's just been one problem: Myself and others have had a lot of trouble reading the code snippets.</p>
<p>I didn't have time to cook up a full Pelican theme, so instead I just hacked the local CSS files. The problem with this hack is that every time I regenerate the blog I have to copy the right CSS files into place. So next week when I have time I'll do a proper Pelican theme.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy!</p>
