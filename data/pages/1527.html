<p>Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python programming language, so it’s not surprising that he is a keynote speaker at most PyCon conferences. What is surprising is that during his <a href="https://youtu.be/0Ef9GudbxXY?t=3m30s">PyCon 2014 keynote</a>, he announced that he would <strong>answer questions only from women</strong>. “Through out the conference, I’ve been attacked by by people with questions, and they were almost all men, so I think the women […] are a little behind and they can catch up here,” he said on stage.</p>
<p>We asked how he came up with the idea. “I was slated to give the keynote on the final day,” van Rossum said. “The day before I had seen a <a href="https://pyvideo.org/video/2684/keynote-jessica-mckellar">keynote by Jessica McKellar</a>, in which she painted a very bleak and well-researched picture of the situation of women in science in technology.” McKellar’s keynote inspired Van Rossum to acknowledge the women at Pycon more directly <a href="https://twitter.com/onyame/status/455342140315693056">by only answering questions only from women</a>.</p>

We just had a really interesting technical Q&amp;A session.  At some point I even managed to sneak in something about </p><a href="http://adainitiative.org/continue-our-work/impostor-syndrome-training/">Imposter Syndrome</a><p>.”
</p><p>Van Rossum also wears his famous “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/women2/2013/04/09/record-number-of-women-give-tech-talks-at-pycon-2013/">Python is for Girls</a>” t-shirt at every conference keynote he can. He’s doing this to make a public statement: women and girls are welcome in the Python community. Some people seem most impressed by van Rossum wearing a shirt that includes the color pink. “The t-shirt itself is not pink. But the girl in the illustration is wearing a pink dress,” van Rossum notes.</p>
<p>This kind of consistent public leadership, in combination with hard work by many people across the Python community, results in a conference that is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/women2/2013/04/09/record-number-of-women-give-tech-talks-at-pycon-2013/">about 30% women</a> – a level almost unheard of in large open source conferences.</p>

<p>“<strong>Looking around me, it is so obvious that women don’t get equal opportunities in tech and there are so many things that lead to that.</strong> The statistics are very clear. If I look around in the café at work there are tons of women. But if I look around me in my little engineering team there is only one woman. And I think it is a shame that so few women choose tech and those that do have so many things to fight.”</p>
<p>We can’t thank Guido enough for his support, activism and leadership, as we all work together towards a more inclusive open source community!</p>
<p>If you’d like to join Guido in sporting Ada Initiative stickers on your laptop and supporting women in Python, it’s easy: Donate to the 2014 Ada Initiative fundraising drive before October 8, and you’ll get the Ada Initiative sticker pack, including 3 copies of the “Not afraid to say the F-word: Feminism” sticker!</p>
