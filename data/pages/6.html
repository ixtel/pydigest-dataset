				<p>It’s been a year since the original version of this blogpost was written and it’s time for an update. The <a href="https://github.com/tschellenbach/Stream-Framework">Stream-Framework</a> is currently the largest open source solution for building newsfeed. This post will point you in the right direction if you want to build a newsfeed using Stream-Framework and Django.</p>
<p>We’ll be building an example app like this <a href="http://exampledjango.getstream.io/">Pinterest style demo</a>. </p>
<p>Besides the open source Stream Framework we also offer a hosted solution for building newsfeed applications at <a href="https://getstream.io/">getstream.io</a>. The example application code for the hosted version can be found on <a href="https://github.com/GetStream/Stream-Example-Py">Github</a>.</p>
<p>For the open source framework the example app code can be found <a href="https://github.com/tbarbugli/stream_framework_example">here</a>.</p>
