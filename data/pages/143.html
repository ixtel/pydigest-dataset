<p><em>Think Python</em> is an introduction to Python programming for beginners. It starts with basic concepts of programming, and is carefully designed to define all terms when they are first used and to develop each new concept in a logical progression. Larger pieces, like recursion and object-oriented programming are divided into a sequence of smaller steps and introduced over the course of several chapters.</p>
<p>Some examples and exercises are based on <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/">Swampy</a>, a Python package written by the author to demonstrate aspects of software design, and to give readers a chance to experiment with simple graphics and animation.</p>
<p><em>Think Python</em> is a Free Book.
