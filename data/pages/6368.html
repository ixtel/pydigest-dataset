<p>This solves word searches -- not a whole lot to explain. I made it since I'm horrible at word searches, and one of my teachers in high school loves to assign them as a fluff grade. The program works with all sizes of word searches, so you should be fine with whatever you enter in.</p>

<p>Here is the input that you should replace with your own wordsearch/words. It is in the first few lines of code.</p>

<pre><code>solutions = ['PYTHON', 'ROBBIE', 'GITHUB', 'BEEF']



puzzle ='''B P G S B S O R
U D Y B E E F O
H B W T E R G B
T Z C N H D E B
I E E W Z O S I
G C H A N B N E
'''
</code></pre>

<p>Here is some output.</p>

<pre><code>Keep in mind, rows are horizontal and columns are vertical.

PYTHON is at row 1 and column 2 going downwards and right diagonally.
GITHUB is at row 6 and column 1 going upwards.
ROBBIE is at row 1 and column 8 going downwards.
BEEF is at row 2 and column 4 going right.
