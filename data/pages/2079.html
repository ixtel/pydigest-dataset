<p><span class="im"><strong>Can you tell us a little about yourself (hobbies, education, etc):</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Hello. I am currently a freelance web developer, primarily focused on <a href="https://realpython.com/" target="_blank">Real Python</a>. My passion has always been to make some sort of positive difference in the world, and I believe I am doing that through my other passion – technology. Besides Real Python, I focus my attention on open source projects as well as mentoring those learning how to code. I have a B.S. in Business Administration as well as a M.S in Information Science. I actually started my undergraduate studies in computer science, but one philosophy class ended up derailing me until I switched to Business. </em></p>
<p><em>When I am not coding, I am generally running (and thinking about coding).</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Why did you start using Python?</strong></p>
<p><em>I needed to better automate the creation of an Excel report and enhance the report itself with data from an external API. At the time I was learning Ruby, but after some brief research I came across the <a href="http://www.python-excel.org/" target="_blank">xlwt</a> library and decided to go with Python. Long story short, we became good friends – Python and I. </em></p>
<p><em>I learned the language, quit my job, and started working freelance, mostly in Excel automation and web scraping. </em></p>
<p> <br/>
 </p>
<p><strong>What other programming languages do you know and which is your favorite?</strong></p>
<p><em>JavaScript is by far my favorite language – other than Python, of course. Angular, specifically, has made the front end fun again and I’ve fully embraced asynchronous programming with Node.</em></p>
<p> <br/>
 </p>
<p><strong>What projects are you working on now?</strong></p>
<p><em>Real Python is a constant. Whether I am adding content to the course, fixing bugs, or writing blog posts, I touch some part of Real Python everyday. Today I am dabbling with the computational science side of Python, analyzing Twitter and Reddit data in order to better understand how our content marketing strategies are faring. Should be fun. </em></p>
<p> <br/>
 </p>
<p><strong>Which Python libraries are your favorite (core or 3rd party)?</strong></p>
<p><em>There’s too many. Flask, Requests, Scrapy, Nose, iPython, Django, just to name a few. I can’t forget pip and virtualenv. Where would we be without them?</em></p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you’d like to say?</strong></p>
<p><em>Thank you.</em></p>
