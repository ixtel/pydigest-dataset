NAME

       btcat - download a torrent file from the network and output its contents to the standard output.

SYNOPSIS

       btcat is a command line tool that downloads a file using the bittorrent protocol and outputs its contents
       to the standard output. btcat streams the data sequentially, which allows processing the file in a
       pipeline before the whole transfer has been completed. It is possible, for instance, to reproduce a media
       file while it's still downloading.

SYNOPSIS

       btcat TORRENTFILE|TORRENTURL [FILEID]

DESCRIPTION

       if no FILEID is specified, a list of file names and file ids will be provided for torrents containing more
       than one file. If FILEID is specified, the program will initiate the download of the file and the contents
       will be dumped to the standard output.

EXAMPLES

              display a list of files and file ids on the torrent

       btcat 'http://www.clearbits.net/get/53-star-wreck---in-the-pirkinning.torrent'

              download the contents of the torrent flow and save it into a file

       btcat 'http://www.clearbits.net/get/53-star-wreck---in-the-pirkinning.torrent' 0 &gt; download.avi

              reproduce a media file on the fly (audio or video)

       btcat 'http://www.clearbits.net/get/53-star-wreck---in-the-pirkinning.torrent' 0 | mplayer -
