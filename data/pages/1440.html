<p><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> - высокоуровневый язык программирования
общего назначения, ориентированный на повышение производительности разработчика и читаемости кода.</p>

<p>Разработчик Python согласился ответить на мои вопросы о разработке и тестировании Python.</p>

<p><strong>Please present yourself.</strong></p>

<p>Brett Cannon, core developer since 2002.</p>

<p><strong>How many developers involved in the development on regular basis?</strong></p>

<p>According to Open HUB we had as high as 36 contributors in a single month in the
past year
(<a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/python/contributors/summary">https://www.openhub.net/p/python/contributors/summary</a>).</p>

<p><strong>How development cycle of Python looks like?</strong></p>

<p>The Python devguide covers this in detail:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/devguide/">https://docs.python.org/devguide/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I have found continuous integration tool based on
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/">BuildBot</a>.
What else tools, tests and testing frameworks do you use?</strong></p>

<p>We use unittest primarily for our tests and our own test runner.</p>

<p><strong>Do developers create tests on regular basis for new functionality and
bugfixes?</strong></p>

<p>Yes; it is expected all bugfixes and new features have tests.</p>

<p><strong>What process do you use for testing?</strong></p>

<p>We don’t have an overarching one other than tests
should be written to make sure semantics don’t regress.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of testing do you use (functional, compatibility, stability, unit
testing etc)?</strong></p>

<p>The buildbots handle compatibility. Otherwise it’s mostly unit and functional
testing.</p>

<p><strong>Python has <a href="http://hg.python.org/benchmarks/file/9a1136898539/README.txt">performance test
suite</a> How often
do you run it?</strong></p>

<p>Whenever someone chooses to run it (no continuous run of it).</p>

<p><strong>Do you compare results only with previous versions?</strong></p>

<p>Rarely. It’s typically only used for verifying that an experimental performance
improvement actually improves performance.</p>

<p><strong>What are the criterias for good performance results?</strong></p>

<p>Typically at least a 5% increase in performance across
the board for anything that may increase code complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Do you use negative testing techniques
(like fuzz testing, fault injection etc)?</strong></p>

<p>Victor Stinner has in the past (e.g. this is
why the faulthandler module exists in the stdlib).</p>

<p><strong>Do you measure code coverage?</strong></p>

<p>On occasion, yes. It is a common starter project for new contributors.</p>

<p><strong>How much of code covered by auto tests?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t have the number handy for a recent coverage run.</p>

<p><strong>What tool do you use for measuring code coverage?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage">coverage.py</a></p>

<p><strong>Do you involve volunteers to testing? I mean things like ‘crowd sourcing’.
(For example Perl community uses volunteers resources to test CPAN modules.
See <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Free-QA-OSCON-2010.pdf">slides from OSCON 2010</a> (PDF)
and <a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">http://www.cpantesters.org/</a>)</strong></p>

<p>PyPI is run independently from python-dev so that doesn’t apply here.
We do include the test suite with Python so users can run it and report any issues they have.</p>

<p><strong>It seems you keep all bugs in bug tracker on
<a href="http://bugs.python.org/">http://bugs.python.org/</a>.  Who is responsible for
tracking of open bugs?</strong></p>

<p>Everyone and no one. =) As a group we try to track bugs, but no one individual owns it.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have triage process?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, and it’s covered in the devguide.</p>

<p><strong>Do you make regular security audit of code?</strong></p>

<p>We have a Coverity project set up which regularly
scans the code (maintained by Christian Heimes).
They did a press release about our very low defect rate:
<a href="http://www.coverity.com/press-releases/coverity-finds-python-sets-new-level-of-quality-for-open-source-software/">http://www.coverity.com/press-releases/coverity-finds-python-sets-new-level-of-quality-for-open-source-software/</a>.</p>

<p>(Interviewer’s note: see also <a href="http://wpcme.coverity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013-Coverity-Scan-Spotlight-Python.pdf">Coverity Scan report</a> (PDF))</p>

<p><strong>Who is responsible for releasing of new version? What are the release
criterias?</strong></p>

<p>We have a release manager. Release criteria is technically no release blockers,
but otherwise it is up to the RM to make that call.  There is always a PEP
written to outline what the targeted release dates are.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for your answers.</strong></p>
