We're pleased to announce the availability of PyPy 2.4.0; faster, fewer bugs, and updated to the python 2.7.8 stdlib.</p>
<p>
This release contains several bugfixes and enhancements. Among the user-facing improvements:
</p><ul>
<li>internal refactoring in string and GIL handling which led to significant speedups</li>
<li>improved handling of multiple objects (like sockets) in long-running  programs. They are collected and released more efficiently, reducing  memory use. In simpler terms - we closed what looked like a memory leak</li>
<li>Windows builds now link statically to zlib, expat, bzip, and openssl-1.0.1i</li>
<li>Many issues were <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues?status=resolved">resolved</a> since the 2.3.1 release in June </li>
</ul>
<p>

We would like to also point out that in September, </p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/psf">the Python Software Foundation</a><p> will </p><a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2014/09/python-software-foundation-matching.html">match funds</a><p> for any donations up to $10k, so head over to our </p><a href="http://pypy.org/">website</a><p> and help this mostly-volunteer effort out.

</p><a href="http://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a><p> is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for </p><a href="https://www.python.org/">CPython</a><p> 2.7 and 3.2.5. It's fast (</p><a href="http://speed.pypy.org/">pypy 2.4 and cpython 2.7.x performance comparison</a><p>) due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler. 
</p><p>
This  release supports x86 machines running Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64,   Windows, and OpenBSD, as well as newer ARM hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7,   with VFPv3) running Linux.Â  </p><p>
We would like to thank our donors for the continued support of the PyPy project.
