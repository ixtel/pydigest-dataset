<p>Have the candidate solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz" rel="nofollow">Fizz/Buzz</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tool-specific Knowledge</strong></p>

<p>If you're using a framework such as Django, Twisted, Tornado, Pyramid, SqlAlchemy, or ZeroMQ then ask them about it.  </p>

<p><strong>SDE Stuff</strong> </p>

<p>Ask the candidate questions about data structures and algorithms.  Ask them to implement a Binary Search Tree and then ask them questions about algorithmic complexity on Insert/Look-up.  Ask them what their top three fav sorting algorithms are, and to implement one of them in Python.  </p>

<p><strong>Security Stuff</strong></p>

<p>Ask them what the dangers of using <code>eval</code>, access data with raw sql vs passing params to stored procs, or allowing arbitrary access to the file system via API calls.</p>

<p><strong>Day-to-Day Stuff</strong></p>

<p>Ask them about how to sandbox Python deployments (with tools like pip, setuptools, virtualenv, etc).  Have they ever had to package a Python project up for deployment?  </p>

<p><strong>Editor Stuff</strong></p>

<p>2 or 4 spaces.  If the candidate answers 2 but has an intelligent answer, then they're still good to go.  If they answer 2 but don't know why, and don't know that its not the community standard, then ... ick.  </p>

<p><strong>Community Stuff</strong></p>

<p>Ask the candidate how they learned the language.  Ask them how did they find the answers to questions along the way.  This will give you huge insight into how well they know the language, how well they interact with others.  </p>

<p>In the end, Python is an easy language.  If they're a good SDE and a great fit to the team, hire them anyway.  </p>
