Work on the 64 bit &amp; 3.x versions progresses slowly but surely. They will happen eventually :)<br/>
<br/></p>
<h3>
What's new in general:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The official Visual C++ for python 2.7 has replaced MinGW as the bundled compiler. Finally everyone can enjoy native python binary extenions for win32. MinGW is still available as an additional plugin.</li>
<li>Console2 has been replaced with ConsoleZ - an actively developed fork. Which adds split views and many other improvements.</li>
<li>Maintaining 2/3 code base is much easier with the inclusion of python-modernize. Also all backports have been updated and expanded with unittest2.</li>
<li>All packages updated to their latest versions (at the time) - IPython, GDAL, SciPy, ITK, VTK. sqlalchemy, Astropy, SWIG etc. </li>
<li>User Local install support has been revived - it is still experimental though.</li>
<li>Numpy has been held back at 1.8.2 to avoid potential compatibility issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
New noteworthy packages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>cvxpy- A domain-specific language for modeling convex optimization problems in Python.</li>
<li>grin - Utility which searches directories of source code better than grep or find.</li>
</ul><p>
Have fun!
