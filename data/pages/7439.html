<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Normally if you change your python code means, you need to restart the server in order to apply the new changes.</p>

<p>If the <code>--auto-reload</code> parameter is enabled means, you don't need to restart the server. It enables auto-reloading of python files and xml files without having to restart the server. It requires <a href="https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify/wiki">pyinotify</a>. It is a Python module for monitoring filesystems changes.</p>

<p><strong>Previous Problem</strong></p>

<p>I got the error:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR ? pyinotify: add_watch: cannot watch /home/user/.local/share/Odoo/addons/8.0 WD=-1, Errno=No space left on device (ENOSPC)
</code></pre>

<p>But I followed the advice of <a href="https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions">this link</a> and now I don't get that error anymore:</p>

<pre><code>sysctl -n -w fs.inotify.max_user_watches=16384
</code></pre>

<p>After this I got this in the server log: </p>

<pre><code>openerp.service.server: Watching addons folder /opt/odoo_8/src/linked-addons
openerp.service.server: AutoReload watcher running
</code></pre>

<p>That means that's working properly. And in fact I tested it with a physical addon path and it worked.</p>

<p><strong>Current Problem</strong></p>

<p>I have all my modules en several folders but I only use one addons path: <code>/opt/odoo_8/src/linked-addons</code>. This folder contains all the links of the modules that I'm using. All modules are working well when I run Odoo.</p>

<p>But the problem is that pyinotify is not able to check the files beyond the links and it doesn't reload the files well. What I should do to fix this? Is there a way that pyinotify can recognise the content of the links?</p>

<p>PD: I don't want to change my way of managing the modules folders in Odoo.</p>
