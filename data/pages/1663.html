				 <p>My <a href="http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=5813">last article</a> showed you how to deploy a Python 3 Application to an Apache Mesos Cluster using the Marathon API. I just wanted to do a quick follow-up on how you can easily add a <a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/health-checks.html">Marathon HTTP health check</a> for your application.</p>

				 <p>Where I work we are actively using <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Apache Mesos</a> to deploy our production applications written in Go, Python, Lua, etc. We also use <a href="https://mesos.github.io/chronos/">Chronos</a> and <a href="https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/">Marathon</a>. In this article I’ll show you how to setup a local Mesos Cluster complete with Marathon (using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>) and how to build a simple <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> 3.x application to deploy into it.</p>

				 <p>I think in many ways <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS (Amazon Web Services)</a> is a game changer for the entire “cloud”. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/">Many companies</a> base all or some of their infrastructure on AWS. Today I want to kick off an AWS Lambda tutorial from a <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> developer’s perspective. Since the past year the Python code I write my articles have been done in Python 3.x however today’s article is an exception since the actual hosted Lambda Python code has to be Python 2.7 since that is what AWS Lambda currently only supports (Jan. 2016). Regardless of having to use Python 2.7.x AWS Lambda is very cool to work with and has a lot of potential to make some very useful services.</p>

				 <p><a href="http://docker.io">Docker</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> have both been getting a lot of attention and rightfully so for the particular problems each one solves. Today I’m going to focus on something each technology does very well and that is building an application that is built with no external dependencies and is easy to deploy. Of course this example will be very scaled down so the article itself doesn’t get so long that readers lose interest but it is enough to extend from for those that want to take it to the next step.</p>

				 <p>Nowadays its pretty common to spin up a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container that will run an application to do some sort of work or processing. Many times this application requires some sort of configuration to set it up correctly to run. With Docker and an app built in Go (or any other language) you could spin up the container and set an environment variable which the application could then read. Let’s assume the environment variable is just an address that points to something like <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/">ectd</a> or <a href="http://consul.io/">Consul</a> where the full configuration settings are stored. Let’s go over how this can be done using Go (golang – excuse the redundancy on Go/golang I use this to help the search engines out).</p>

				 <p>A <a href="http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=5469">few articles ago I showed you</a> how to create a Python 3 Microservice (a simple Minecraft service). At the end of that article I mentioned in the future I’d show you how to build a self-contained Python application/service. Well, today is that day.</p>
<p>I’ll use <a href="http://pypy.org">PyPy</a> (the Python 3.2.5 compatible PyPy3 2.4.0 version) to show how this can easily be done and how you can install packages into the self-contained instance of Python. What this means is you easily package this up and simply extract it to another machine (same architecture or you need to modify some steps) and it will just run even if Python is not installed there. In fact there are several ways to do what I’m going to show you how to do today and several ways to package this up. I’m just going to focus on one possible way to do this as easily as possible.</p>

				 <p>A while back (and even recently) I was looking for any sort of project that allowed you to create and define your own webhooks. Features like allowing others to subscribe to those events, and then trigger your custom webhooks when needed which then would go and notify each subscription’s endpoint. I couldn’t find anything like that. Pieces that did some of those features, but not the whole package. So <a href="http://pywebhooks.io">PyWebhooks</a> was born (Github repo <a href="https://github.com/chadlung/pywebhooks">here</a>).</p>

				 <p>There are a lot of tools out there for <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> (golang) to build REST based services. <a href="http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/">Gorilla</a> is a web toolkit for the Go programming language. With Gorilla you can build <a href="http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/rpc">RPC</a> services, <a href="http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/websocket">WebSocket</a> apps and many more. Today I’m going to go over building a simple REST service using <a href="http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux">Gorilla (Mux)</a>.</p>

				 <p>I currently work in <a href="http://www.emc.com">EMC’s Cloud Services</a> group and we scale very large storage solutions. We write a lot of code and many times this is done in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>. Previously <a href="http://www.giantflyingsaucer.com/blog/?p=5482">I wrote another open source tool</a> that worked with <a href="http://www.emc.com/vipr">EMC’s ViPR</a> product. Today I want to announce that <a href="https://github.com/chadlung/ecsminion">ECS Minion</a> is ready to go. We use both ViperPy and ECS Minion in production but if you find any issues please <a href="https://github.com/chadlung/ecsminion/issues">file it on Github</a>.</p>
<p>To get started check out <a href="https://github.com/chadlung/ecsminion/blob/master/README.rst">the readme</a> which has plenty of examples.</p>
<p>To install simply run:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">
$ pip install ecsminion

				 <p>I’ve been keeping an eye on <a href="http://rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a> for a while now and recently began working with it. There is a lot to like about RethinkDB like the ability to easily cluster and scale your deployment but what I’m going to focus on today is something called <a href="http://rethinkdb.com/docs/changefeeds/python/">Changefeeds</a>. I’ll start this blog article off with installing a development server running RethinkDB and then move onto a quick tutorial. From there we will look at Changefeeds.</p>
