<html><body><div><p>Learning about these anti-patterns will help you to avoid them in your own code and make you
a better programmer (hopefully). Each pattern comes with a small description, examples and
possible solutions. You can check many of them for free against your project at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns">QuantifiedCode</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: We think that you can learn as much from reading bad code as you can from reading good one.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer</strong>: There is an overwhelming amount of Python books that show you how to do things by focusing on best practices and examples of good code. There are only very few books out there that show you how <strong>not</strong> to do things. We wanted to change that by providing you with an <strong>anti-book</strong> that teaches you things which you should <strong>never</strong> do in practice.</p>

<p>We’re <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quantifiedcode.com/">QuantifiedCode</a>, a Berlin-based startup. Our mission is to help programmers write better code! Our first product is an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quantifiedcode.com/">online tool</a> for automated, data-driven code review. When building this tool we learned a lot about code quality in Python and decided to compile our knowledge into this book.</p>

<p>This book contains anti- and migrations pattern for Python and for popular Python frameworks, such as Django. We categorized the patterns as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Correctness</strong>: Anti-patterns that will literally break your code or make it do the wrong things.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability</strong>: Anti-patterns that will make your code hard to maintain or extend.</li>
<li><strong>Readability</strong>: Anti-patterns that will make your code hard to read or understand.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Anti-patterns that will unnecessarily slow your code down.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: Anti-patterns that will pose a security risk to your program.</li>
<li><strong>Migration</strong>: Patterns that help you migrate faster to new versions of a framework</li>
</ul>
<p>Some patterns can belong in more than one category, so please don’t take the choice that we’ve made too serious. If you think a pattern is grossly misplaced in its category,
feel free to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/quantifiedcode/python-anti-patterns/issues">create an issue</a> on Github.</p>
