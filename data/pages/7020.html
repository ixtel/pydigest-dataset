<html><body><div><div class="video-details-description"><p>The Zen of Python dictates that there should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do something. However, when it comes to interoperation with C and C++, there is a multitude of options: the Python C API, Boost.Python, ctypes, cffi, Cython. I will describe my quest to find the <strong>holy grail</strong>^W^W <strong>right interface</strong> for a high-performance networking library.</p>
<p>The talk is largely a case study in applying Boost.Python, and will look at some issues such as the Global Interpreter Lock, handling KeyboardInterrupt cleanly, and managing object lifetime. I will briefly mention some of the alternative tools to explain why I settled on Boost.Python. It is not a complete Boost.Python tutorial, but rather aims to give a sense of the flavour and show how it's used in a real application.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, this talk will have a lot of C++ code in it, and some familiarity with C++ will be useful.</p></div>
