				<h1>Introducing ScrapyRT: An API for Scrapy spiders</h1>
				
			</div>
			<div class="entry clear">
								<p>We’re proud to announce our new open source project, <a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/scrapyrt" target="_blank">ScrapyRT</a>! ScrapyRT, short for Scrapy Real Time, allows you to extract data from a single web page via an API using your existing Scrapy spiders.</p>
<h2>Why did we start this project?</h2>
<p>We needed to be able to retrieve the latest data for a previously scraped page, on demand. ScrapyRT made this easy by allowing us to reuse our spider logic to extract data from a single page, rather than running the whole crawl again.</p>
<h2>How does ScrapyRT work?</h2>
<p>ScrapyRT runs as a web service and retrieving data is as simple as making a request with the URL you want to extract data from and the name of the spider you would like to use.</p>
<p>Let’s say you were running ScrapyRT on localhost, you could make a request like this:</p>
<pre>http://localhost:9080/crawl.json?spider_name=foo&amp;url=http://example.com/product/1</pre>
<p>ScrapyRT will schedule a request in Scrapy for the URL specified and use the ‘foo’ spider’s parse method as a callback. The data extracted from the page will be serialized into JSON and returned in the response body. If the spider specified doesn’t exist, a 404 will be returned. The majority of Scrapy spiders will be compatible without any additional programming necessary.</p>
<h2>How do I use ScrapyRT in my Scrapy project?</h2>
<pre> &gt; git clone https://github.com/scrapinghub/scrapyrt.git
 &gt; cd scrapyrt
 &gt; pip install -r requirements.txt
 &gt; python setup.py install
 &gt; cd ~/your-scrapy-project
 &gt; scrapyrt</pre>
<p>ScrapyRT will be running on port 9080, and you can schedule your spiders per the example shown earlier.</p>
<p>We hope you find ScrapyRT useful and look forward to hearing your feedback!</p>
