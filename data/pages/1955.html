<p><strong>What should I speak about?</strong>
In short, anything software or python related.  We want to make a special emphasis on covering unique things at PyTennessee.  We would love talks on financial, scientific, systems management, and general development topics. We also want to have a bit of fun, so bring on the weird, odd and wonderful python talks!</p>
<p><strong>Talks</strong>
These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days.  They're mostly 45 minutes long, but we offer a limited number of 30 minute slots. We organize the schedule into three "tracks", grouping talks by topic and having them in the same room for consecutive sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorials</strong>
As with the talks, we are looking for tutorials that can grow this community at any level. We aim for tutorials that will advance Python, advance this community, and shape the future. There are 3 2-hour tutorial sessions and 4 1-hour tutorial sessions available.</p>
