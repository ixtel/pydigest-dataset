<p>bcloud-core is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/LiuLang/bcloud" rel="nofollow">bcloud</a>.</p>
<p>Advanced features such as beatiful Gtk GUI, secure keyring, intelligent file
manager, localization were all trimmed.
Only core api logic was kept intending to minimize requirement.</p>
<p>For daily usage, the upstream is highly recommended.</p>
