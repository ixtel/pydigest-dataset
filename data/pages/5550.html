<h2>Design considerations</h2>
<p>sphinxserve was originally conceived as a Python and Linux project that can
visualize sphinx document modifications in real time while working on them. At
its core, sphinxserve uses the awesome projects <a href="http://gevent.org" rel="nofollow">gevent</a>  to provide
concurrency and event coordination, <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org" rel="nofollow">flask</a> for web communication, Sphinx
for reStructucturedText rendering and of course <a href="https://www.python.org" rel="nofollow">Python</a>. sphinxserve used to
control browser reloading with xdotool, introducing a complex system tool
dependency. On release 0.7, sphinxserve decouples from this system dependency
using instead flask-sockets python package. The tradeoff here was to
temporarily drop python3 support until the gevent ecosystem officially
supports python3 which should be soon. Also, the filesystem notification tool
was upgraded to watchdog, removing another system dependency and making
the code more generic and cleaner. With these changes, as of release 0.7.4,
sphinxserve is able to run in other platforms as OSX and Windows for example.</p>

<div id="installation">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>sphinxserve can be installed either as a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxserve" rel="nofollow">python package</a>, or as a <a href="https://www.docker.com" rel="nofollow">docker</a>
application. On linux and OSX, it can also be installed as a pex
<a href="https://github.com/mzdaniel/sphinxserve/releases" rel="nofollow">python executable</a></p>
<div id="python-executable-pex">
<h3>Python executable (PEX)</h3>
<p>This is the easiest (no compilation or fancy tooling needed) and smallest
(~9 MB) way to install sphinxserve using the excellent <a href="https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex" rel="nofollow">PEX</a> tool. In itself,
it is a zipfile containing all python package dependencies and only requires
the python interpreter. This pex is verified to work at least in Debian&gt;=7,
Ubuntu&gt;=14, Centos&gt;=7 and Arch distros on Linux and in Yosemite on OSX.</p>
<div id="linux">
<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>System dependencies: glibc linux&gt;=3, python&gt;=2.7,&lt;3 and a web browser
supporting websockets (Firefox, Chrome, etc) on Linux:</p>
<pre>$ wget -O ~/bin/sphinxserve https://github.com/mzdaniel/sphinxserve/releases/download/0.7.4/sphinxserve-linux
$ chmod 755 ~/bin/sphinxserve
</pre>
</div>
<div id="osx">
<h4>OSX</h4>
<p>Yosemite already has all needed dependencies:</p>
<pre>$ wget -O ~/bin/sphinxserve https://github.com/mzdaniel/sphinxserve/releases/download/0.7.4/sphinxserve-osx
$ chmod 755 ~/bin/sphinxserve
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="id1">
<h3>Python package</h3>
<p>Linux system dependencies: glibc linux&gt;=3, python&gt;=2.7,&lt;3, the C toolchain
(package names dependent on linux distro) to compile gevent and a web browser
supporting websockets. pip automatically downloads sphinxserve and its python
dependencies, compiles and builds wheel binary packages as needed and finally
install sphinxserve.</p>
<p>OSX system dependencies: Xcode. Verified to work on Yosemite.</p>
<p>Windows system dependencies: Verified to work on Windows 7, python &gt;=2.7,&lt;3 and
a web browser supporting websockets with just pip installing.</p>
<p>In all systems:</p>
<pre>$ pip install sphinxserve
</pre>
</div>
<div id="docker-application">
<h3>Docker application</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com" rel="nofollow">Docker</a> is an extraordinary tool that simplifies the entire dependency tree
by including it in a system image. This makes the installation experience
much more pleasant and the ability to run on OSX, Windows and Linux with the
same image, assuming proper setup of the docker network and volume. Another
advantage is that a running image cannot see your filesystem by default.
Sharing directories and which ones is an explicit setup. This method is
verified to work on Linux so far.</p>
<p>System dependencies: docker and a web browser supporting websockets.</p>
<p>This installation command automatically downloads sphinxserve image (~40 MB)
and creates a small shell script ~/bin/sphinxserve that simplifies the running
interface with the following command:</p>
<pre>$ docker run mzdaniel/sphinxserve install | bash
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="launching">
<h2>Launching</h2>
<p>Launching sphinxserve is as simple as:</p>
<pre>$ sphinxserve [OPTIONAL_SPHINX_PATH]
</pre>
<p>By default, it assumes the sphinx project is in the current directory. A
sphinx project needs to have the configuration file conf.py, and if not found,
sphinxserve will automatically create 2 new files: conf.py and a
restructuredtext index.rst.</p>
<p>To change host and/or port, and other options, check the help with:</p>
<pre>$ sphinxserve serve --help
</pre>
</div>
<div id="workflow">
<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>After launching sphinxserve, it will build the sphinx pages and serve them
by default on localhost:8888. To see the rendered documentation, just point
your browser to localhost:8888. Any saved changes on rst or txt files will
trigger docs rebuild.</p>
