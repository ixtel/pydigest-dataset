<p>ZX2C4's pass compatible Python library and cli</p>








<p>passpy has been written to be a platform independent library and cli
that is compatible with <a href="http://www.passwordstore.org" rel="nofollow">ZX2C4’s pass</a>.</p>
<p>passpy saves your passwords in gpg encrypted files and optionally uses
git as a revision tool.  All files are stored inside
<tt><span class="pre">~/.password-store</span></tt> (or any other location) and can be organised into
folders.  You can also just copy the whole store to have your
passwords available where ever you like.</p>
<p>For further information on the project head on over to <a href="https://github.com/user/bfrascher/passpy.git" rel="nofollow">github</a> or
