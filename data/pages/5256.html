<p>Since language standards rarely mandate implementation methods, I'd like to know what is the <strong>real world hashing method</strong> used by C++ standard library implementations (libc++, libstdc++ and dinkumware).</p>

<p>In case it's not clear, I expect the answer to be a method like these : </p>

<ul>
<li>Hashing with chaining</li>
<li>Hashing by Division / Multiplication</li>
<li>Universal hashing </li>
<li>Perfect hashing (static, dynamic)</li>
<li>Hashing with <strong>open addressing</strong> (linear/quadratic probing or double hashing)</li>
<li>Robin-Hood hashing</li>
<li>Bloom Filters</li>
<li>Cuckoo hashing</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing why a particular method was chosen over the others would be a good thing as well. </p>
