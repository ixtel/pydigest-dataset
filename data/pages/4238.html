<p>Today we're excited to introduce a new project: <a href="https://github.com/yhat/rodeo/">Rodeo</a>. Rodeo is an IDE that's 
built expressly for doing data science in Python. Think of it as a light 
weight alternative to the IPython Notebook.</p>
<p>We've been using it for projects internally, but today we're releasing it to 
the public! We hope you like it as much as we do.</p>

<h3>Why we built it</h3>
<p>I like the IPython Notebook for presentations and tutorials, but I often find 
it a little cumbersome for day to day work. I generally prefer to work in a 
fairly minimalist environment like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>
or VIM. Juxtaposed with the notebook, and it makes the notebook feel really 
bloated.</p>
<p>The things I really need when I'm analyzing data are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a terminal with autocomplete</li>
<li>a text editor</li>
<li>ability to see plots</li>
</ul>
<p>Given how minimal my requirements were, it was a bit frustrating that there 
doesn't seem to be a lightweight option for Python.</p>
<h3>Quickstart</h3>
<p>The easiest way to get going is to use <code>pip</code>. You can then run the <code>rodeo</code> 
command from the terminal. You'll need to provide a directory as an argument.
This tells rodeo which files you want to edit/run.</p>
<p><code>$ pip install rodeo</code></p>
<p><code>$ rodeo .</code></p>
<h3>Rodeo in action</h3>
<p>Rodeo is designed to be a simple, lightweight alternative to the IPython 
Notebook. It runs in your browser, but has the keyboard shortcuts and 
interactivity to make it feel more like a native app.</p>
<p/><center>Autocomplete from either your editor or the console.</center>

<p/><center>Help commands are displayed and saved in their own tab.</center>

<p/><center>Click to view data frames and their content. You can CTRL + F to find specific data.</center>

<h3>Before you go</h3>
<p>We know Rodeo is far from perfect. If you find any bugs or have feature ideas, 
feel free to submit them as <a href="https://github.com/yhat/rodeo/issues">GitHub Issues</a>.
We're working on adding a tighter IPython integration along with better file i/o
and directory display.</p>
<h3>Appendix: How it works</h3>
<p>Rodeo uses the <a href="https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/kernels.html">IPython kernel</a> under the hood to handle communication between 
the UI and your python environment. In this regard, you can sort of think of it
as an alternative front end to the IPython Notebook.</p>
<p>For the editor, we're using <a href="http://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html">Ace</a>. It's easy to use
and looks great! We're going to be incorporating some additional Ace features
as configurable preferences for Rodeo in the near future.</p>
