<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>While composing this enriching this list of data science discussions, I found this awesome ‘<em>poem’</em> drafted statistically. Ain’t it pretty cool ? Dedicated to that every person who thinks this world is driven by data (including my team):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A curvy young belle, Billie Jean,<br/>
Makes a measure of each man she’s seen.<br/>
Yet the size of one sample<br/>
Was sufficiently ample<br/>
To skew median far from the mean.<br/>
The jealous lads started to hate him,<br/>
And the ladies all lined up to date him;<br/>
Not his charm, nor his suit<br/>
Sets the gals in pursuit,<br/>
But the infamous size of his datum.<br/>
That persistent young lass, Billie Jean,<br/>
Measured more, she was quite the machine!<br/>
Like a Bell, things now curved,<br/>
And all same, she observed,<br/>
Were the median, mode and the mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this poem suggests? Of course, I’ve shared it for a reason.</p>
<p>And the subtle reason is, there are many more interesting ways to learn subjects which are difficult otherwise. Precisely, people learn data science and its related concepts using text books, guides, video-tutorials, interactive websites and every other way which comes at their disposal. Adding to this list, there’s another interesting and inspiring way to learn. And that is using ‘<a href="http://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com" target="_blank">Discussions</a>‘. Because of its need, we run a discussion portal on Analytics Vidhya as well. But today’s article focuses on a much larger community – Reddit.</p>
<p>Reddit, the Front Page of Internet, is a community known for its candid and outspoken discussions. A platform where spam-ism is despised and genuine content is welcomed. It has content related to everything under the sun. I’d be astonished, if not. However, for people who are new to Reddit, reading / participating on Reddit discussions can be very intimidating at the start. It can take some time before you understand how the forum works.</p>
<p>But there is a ton of useful knowledge on Reddit, which you can learn. People who are active on Reddit would agree to it. Hence, in this article, we have summarized some of the best discussions related to <strong>Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Python, R Programming, Big Data and Statistics. </strong>I hope that you benefit out of it, if you don’t follow Reddit religiously or can not fit in the community.</p>

<h2>AMA with Top Data Scientists</h2>
<p>I would do injustice to this article, if I don’t start it from AMAs. AMAs (or Ask Me Anything) are an important part of Reddit community and a setup where you can ask questions to experts in a particular field. I suppose these people require no formal introduction. They are considered to be the best of brains working towards the development of machine learning, deep learning, neural networks etc. If you ever seek inspiration, check out what are folks are upto. Below are the AMAs with 3 key highlights in 4 lines each:</p>
<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Geoff-Hinton_web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18648" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Geoff-Hinton_web.jpg?resize=151%2C200" alt="data science, geoff hinton, deep learning" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>a) <strong><span>On human brain</span></strong> – ‘The brain has about 10<sup>14</sup> synapses and we only live for about 10<sup>9</sup> seconds. So we have a lot more parameters than data. This motivates the idea that we must do a lot of unsupervised learning since the perceptual input (including proprioception) is the only place we can get 10<sup>5</sup> dimensions of constraint per second’.</p>
<p>b) <strong><span>On his career</span></strong> – ‘My father was a Stalinist and sent me to a private Christian school where we had to pray every morning. From a very young age I was convinced that many of the things that the teachers and other kids believed were just obvious nonsense. That’s great training for a scientist and it transferred very well to artificial intelligence. But it was a nasty shock when I found out what Stalin actually did.’</p>
<p>c) <strong><span>On Dark Knowledge</span> </strong>–  ‘Yes, I invented the term “Dark Knowledge”. Its inspired by the idea that most of the knowledge is in the ratios of tiny probabilities that have virtually no influence on the cost function used for training or on the test performance. So the normal things we look at miss out on most of the knowledge, just like physicists miss out on most of the matter and energy.’</p>
<p> </p>

<p>a) <strong><span>On Career in Deep Learning</span></strong> – ‘Read, learn from online material, try things for yourself . Take as many math and physics course as you can, and learn to program. You have to figure out what’s important, know what to ignore, and know how to approximate. These are skills you need to conceptualize, model, and analyze ML models. Another set of courses that are relevant is signal processing, optimization, and control/system theory.</p>
<p>b) <strong><span>On most overlooked things in machine learning</span></strong> – ‘Kernel methods are great for many purposes, but they are merely glorified template matching. There is nothing magical about margin maximization. It’s just another way of saying “L2 regularization” (despite the cute math). There is no opposition between deep learning and graphical models. Many deep learning approaches can be seen as factor graphs.</p>
<p>c) <strong><span>On emotions in Robots</span></strong> – ‘Emotions do not necessarily lead to irrational behavior. They sometimes do, but they also often save our lives. If emotions are anticipations of outcome (like fear is the anticipation of impending disasters or elation is the anticipation of pleasure), or if emotions are drives to satisfy basic ground rules for survival (like hunger, desire to reproduce), then intelligent agent will have to have emotions.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>a) <strong><span>Recommendation after Coursera ML course</span></strong> – ‘Here’re a few common paths: 1. Many people are applying ML to projects by themselves at home, or in their companies. This helps both with your learning, as well as helps build up a portfolio of ML projects in your resume (if that is your goal). If you’re not sure what projects to work on, Kaggle competitions can be a great way to start.</p>
<p>b) <strong><span>Best place to work for ML &amp; AI Engineers</span></strong> – ‘I think Baidu, Google and Facebook are all great places to work! But Baidu Research is very much a startup environment. With ~40 people in our Silicon Valley team, we also invest a lot in employee development. I think these things make the best possible combination for driving machine learning research, which is why both of us (Adam &amp; Andrew) had decided to join Baidu.</p>
<p>c) <strong><span>On key drivers of Deep Learning</span></strong> – ‘I think the two key drivers of deep learning are: – Rise of computation. Not just GPUs, but now the migration toward HPC (high performance computing, aka supercomputers). – Rise of availability of data, because of the digitization of our society, in which increasing amounts of activity on computers/cellphones/etc. creates data.’</p>

<p> </p>
<p>a) <strong><span>On choice of academia</span></strong> – ‘I like academia because I can choose what to work on, I can choose to work on long-term goals, I can work for the benefit of humanity rather than for a specific company, and I can talk about my work freely. Note that to different degrees, my esteemed colleagues in large industrial labs also enjoy some of that freedom.’</p>
<p>b) <strong><span>On RNN</span></strong> – ‘Recurrent or recursive nets are really useful tools for modelling all kinds of dependency structures on variable-sized objects. We have made progress on ways to train them and it is one of the important areas of current research in the deep learning community. Examples of applications: speech recognition (especially the language part), machine translation, sentiment analysis, speech synthesis, handwriting synthesis and recognition, etc.’</p>
<p>c) <strong><u>On upcoming challenges in NLP</u> </strong>– ‘I believe that the really interesting challenge in NLP, which will be the key to actual “natural language understanding”, is the design of learning algorithms that will be able to learn to represent meaning. There are also more computational challenges: we need to be able to train much larger models (say 10000x bigger), and we can’t afford to wait 10000x more time for training.’</p>

<p> </p>
<p>a) <strong><span>On the future of RNN</span></strong> – ‘The world of RNNs is such a big world because RNNs (the deepest of all NNs) are general computers, and because efficient computing hardware in general is becoming more and more RNN-like, as dictated by physics: lots of processors connected through many short and few long wires. Both supervised learning RNNs and reinforcement learning RNNs will be greatly scaled up.’</p>
<p>b) <strong><span>On his hobbies</span></strong> – ‘In my spare time, I am trying to compose music, and create visual art. And while I am doing this, it seems obvious to me that art and science and music are driven by the same basic principle.I think the basic motivation (objective function) of artists and scientists and comedians is data compression progress, that is, the first derivative of data compression performance on the observed history.’</p>
<p>c)<strong> </strong><span><strong>On future of AI</strong></span> – ’20 years from now we’ll have 10,000 times faster computers for the same price, plus lots of additional medical data to train them. I assume that even the <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deeplearning.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">already existing neural network algorithms</a> will greatly outperform human experts in most if not all domains of medical diagnosis, from melanoma detection to plaque detection in arteries, and innumerable other applications.’</p>
