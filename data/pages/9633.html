  <p>Over the last couple years, researchers in the Fire Research Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have used Python/Anaconda tools on a wide range of projects. Only recently have we started using Bokeh. Two projects that use Bokeh are described in this post: the first uses Bokeh to create an interactive map of NIST fire studies and the second uses Bokeh to plot thermal data from a firefighter's immediate environment in real time.</p>

  <h2 id="Interactive-Map-of-NIST-Fire-Studies">Interactive Map of NIST Fire Studies<a class="anchor-link" href="#Interactive-Map-of-NIST-Fire-Studies"/></h2>
  <p>Fire research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) dates back to the early 1900's following the need for a standardized fire hydrant coupling after the Great Baltimore Fire. Fast-forward to the 1980s and for the last 30 years, NIST researchers have been performing experiments and running computer simulations following fire incidents to advance the field of fire safety.</p>
  <p>NIST researchers wrote detailed reports of their work following these fires, but an intuitive, centralized source of this material did not exist. Therefore, we wanted to build an interface to fix this. We felt a map that showed where the fires occured with interactivity to link to the reports would be an interesting project.</p>

      <p>The addresses of the fires were geocoded using GoogleV3 geocoder to generate the lattitude and longitude for each fire. The studies were then coded into one of four categories: LODD/LODI (a fire with a firefighter Line of Duty Death or Line of Duty Injury), Civilian Loss, WUI (wildland urban interface fire), or LODD/LODI and Civilian Loss. The data file also includes the NIST hosting link of the report so that we can link to it through first class Bokeh features.</p>

  <p>Bokeh was also utilized by our group at NIST to improve an existing project <a href="#References">[1]</a> focused on characterizing a firefighter's thermal exposure in fire scenarios.</p>
  <p>To overcome challenges associated with measuring a firefighter's continuously changing environment, a portable measurement and data acquisition system was designed to be used with firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE). The system needed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>measure the temperature and heat flux (heat rate per area) of a firefighter's immediate environment</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>store and circulate cooling water around the heat flux sensor</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>withstand the typical movements and actions of firefighters and the elevated thermal conditions encountered in a fire environment</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>accompany a firefighter as he/she moves throughout the environment to conduct various tasks</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Description-of-Portable-Measurement-and-Data-Acquisition-System">Description of Portable Measurement and Data Acquisition System<a class="anchor-link" href="#Description-of-Portable-Measurement-and-Data-Acquisition-System"/></h3>
  <p>The portable system can be divided into two main parts: the helmet and the pack.</p>
  <h4 id="Helmet-Portion">Helmet Portion<a class="anchor-link" href="#Helmet-Portion"/></h4>
  <p>The helmet portion of the system consists of a type K thermocouple and a Schmidt-Boelter heat flux gauge (SBG) to measure temperature and heat flux, respectively. Both sensors are mounted to the aluminum shield on the front of a firefighter helmet.</p>
  <p class="text-center"><img src="/sites/default/files/helmet.png"/></p>
  <p>Two sections of 1/8‚Äù diameter rubber tubing connected to the SBG are used to transport the cooling water around the gauge. The rubber tubing and sensor wires travel out the backside of the helmet and to a hydration backpack.</p>
  <h4 id="Pack-Portion">Pack Portion<a class="anchor-link" href="#Pack-Portion"/></h4>
  <p>The data logger rests in the front pocket of the pack, the water reservoir used to store the cooling water for the SBG is located in the rear pocket of the pack, and the water pump used to circulate the cooling water is located in a side pocket of the pack.</p>
  <p class="text-center"><img src="/sites/default/files/pack.png"/></p>
  <p>The low-profile hydration pack is worn under a PPE coat on the chest of the firefighter to avoid interference with the Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus worn on the firefighter‚Äôs back. Because the hydration pack is worn underneath the PPE coat, its components are protected from the intense thermal conditions encountered in fire environments.</p>
  <p class="text-center"><img src="/sites/default/files/FF_with_pack.png"/></p>
  <h3 id="New-Data-Logger-with-WiFi-Support">New Data Logger with WiFi Support<a class="anchor-link" href="#New-Data-Logger-with-WiFi-Support"/></h3>
  <p>Recently, we decided to replace the original data logger with a microcontroller that supports a Linux distribution and WiFi. Using Python with the microcontroller data logger expands the capabilities of the portable measurement and data acquisition system and allows the logged data to be plotted in real time. The workflows to collect, store, and plot the sensor data using the original data logger and using the new microcontroller data logger are presented and discussed below. </p>
  <p class="text-center"><img src="/sites/default/files/original_workflow.png"/> <img src="/sites/default/files/new_workflow.png"/></p>
  <p> The workflow improved significantly by using the microcontroller data logger. The steps to collect, save, and plot the data occur immediately after one another and have been automated using Python. The microcontroller's built-in WiFi support is used to transmit the sensor data to a host computer in real time. Collected data are now saved in two separate locations (the logger's microSD card and the host computer) during the logging process. Additionally, the host computer utilizes the Bokeh server to plot data in real time.</p>
  <h3 id="Plotting-Helmet-Sensor-Data-in-Real-Time">Plotting Helmet Sensor Data in Real Time<a class="anchor-link" href="#Plotting-Helmet-Sensor-Data-in-Real-Time"/></h3>
  <p>The procedure outlined below assumes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the thermocouple and heat flux sensors from the portable system have been connected to the microcontroller </li>
    <li>the microcontroller has been configured to connect to the same WiFi network as the local computer and to run a Python script to receive and save the sensor data upon booting up</li>
    <li>the host computer has been configured with the packages, tools, and files necessary to run the message broker RabbitMQ and Bokeh server and to execute two Python scripts: one to read and save data from the broker and one to plot the data</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="Prepare-Host-Computer-to-Receive-Data">Prepare Host Computer to Receive Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Prepare-Host-Computer-to-Receive-Data"/></h4>
  <p>After launching the RabbitMQ server on the host computer, the Python script to read and save data from the message broker to the host computer is executed with the following arguements:</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash;">$ python broker_to_host.py &lt;network_ip_address&gt; &lt;path/to/log_file.csv&gt;</pre>
  <h4 id="Turn-on-Microcontroller">Turn on Microcontroller<a class="anchor-link" href="#Turn-on-Microcontroller"/></h4>
  <p>Upon booting up, the microcontroller connects to the appropriate WiFi network and runs a Python script to read sensor data, save the data on the logger's microSD card (path <code>/mnt/sda1/</code> ), and send the data to the message broker:</p>
  <pre class="brush: bash;">$ python /mnt/sda1/logger_to_broker.py &lt;network_ip_address&gt; &lt;logger_name&gt; /mnt/sda1/log_file.csv</pre>
  <h4 id="Log-&amp;-Send-Data-to-Broker">Log &amp; Send Data to Broker<a class="anchor-link" href="#Log-&amp;-Send-Data-to-Broker"/></h4>
  <p>The script executed by the logger converts the voltages output by the helmet sensors to their corresponding measurements, saves the data to a microSD card, and publishes the data to the RabbitMQ message broker. The Python client Pika is used to communicate with the message broker.</p>
  <p>First, using the argparse module, the RabbitMQ message broker's ip address (WiFi ip address), name of the microcontroller, and log file on microSD card to save data to are read from the command used to run the script:</p>
  <pre class="brush: python;">parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('broker', help='Network or IP address of message broker')
parser.add_argument('logger_id', help='Logger name or ID')
parser.add_argument('log_file', help='Location of log file')
args = parser.parse_args()</pre>
  <p>Next, a connection is established with the message broker and an exchange to transmit data to the broker queue is created:</p>
  <pre class="brush: python;">connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=args.broker))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.exchange_declare(exchange='logs', type='fanout')</pre>
  <p>After establishing a connection to the broker, sensor voltages are read and converted to their corresponding measurements every second and the data are sent to the broker and saved on the logger's microSD card:</p>
  <pre class="brush: python;">while True:
    # Read voltages from ADC channels
    T_voltage = read_voltage(1)
    HF_voltage = read_voltage(2)

    # Calculate temperature, HF
    T = calculate_T(T_voltage)
    HF = calculate_HF(HF_voltage)

    # Construct message and publish to broker
    message = (time.ctime()+',%s,%d,%0.1f,%0.2f') % (args.logger_id, total_time, T, HF)
    channel.basic_publish(exchange='logs', routing_key='', body=message)

    # Save data to microSD card
    with open(args.log_file, 'a+') as text_file:
        text_file.write(message+'\n')

    total_time = total_time + 1        
    time.sleep(1)</pre>
  <p><code>read_voltage()</code> is a user defined function specific to the microcontroller that reads the voltage from a defined channel (here, the thermocouple is connected to channel 1 and the SBG is connected to channel 2). The sensor voltages are converted to their corresponding measurements through a user defined function specific to the sensor type and certain calibration constants specified by the manufacturer. For example, the calibration constants specified by the manufacturer for the SBG correspond to the slope (<code>m</code>) and y-intercept (<code>b</code>) of a linear fit across data from calibration tests. The function <code>calculate_HF()</code> uses the constants and basic equation of a line to convert voltage to heat flux:</p>
  <pre class="brush: python;">def calculate_HF(voltage):
    HF = (voltage)*m + b
    HF = round(float(HF), 2)
    return HF</pre>
  <p>After the voltages are converted, a message is constructed in the format <code>&lt;time stamp&gt;, &lt;x-axis time value for plot&gt;, &lt;temperature&gt;, &lt;heat flux&gt;</code> and is published to the exchange.</p>
  <h4 id="Read-&amp;-Save-Data-from-Broker">Read &amp; Save Data from Broker<a class="anchor-link" href="#Read-&amp;-Save-Data-from-Broker"/></h4>
  <p><code>broker_to_host.py</code> was executed earlier to prepare the host computer to read data from the RabbitMQ message broker. Simliar to the script used to send data to the broker, <code>broker_to_host.py</code> begins by using the argparse module to read the arguments defined in the execution command:</p>
  <pre class="brush: python;">parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('broker', help='network or IP address of message broker')
parser.add_argument('log_file', help='Location of log file')
args = parser.parse_args()</pre>
  <p>Then, Pika is used to establish a connection with the message broker and data are read from the broker and saved to <code>log_file.csv</code> by calling the user defined function <code>callback</code>:</p>
  <pre class="brush: python;">connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(host=args.broker))
channel = connection.channel()
channel.exchange_declare(exchange='logs', type='fanout')
queue_name = result.method.queue
channel.queue_bind(exchange='logs', queue=queue_name)
channel.basic_consume(callback, queue=queue_name, no_ack=True)
channel.start_consuming()</pre>
  <h4 id="Generate-Bokeh-Plots-from-Saved-Data">Generate Bokeh Plots from Saved Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Generate-Bokeh-Plots-from-Saved-Data"/></h4>
  <p>The Bokeh server is used to publish and update plots of the sensor data in real time. The command <code>bokeh-server</code> is used to run the Bokeh server on the host computer. Next, a Python script is executed to create, display, and update the plots as new data are received. The script creates plots in a manner similar to that outlined below.</p>
