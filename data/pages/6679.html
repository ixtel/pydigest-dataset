<p><span><span><span>Hello friends, welcome to my new blog </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>Python Play</b></span></span></span><span><span><span>. I am happy that you are interested in learning Python programming language; hence you are here reading this first post.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Before I start writing anything about Python and get into the details of programming, I think it is necessary to let you know a little about me.</span></span></span></p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p><span><span><span>I am </span></span></span><span><span><span><a href="http://vaibhavmule.com/">Vaibhav Mule</a></span></span></span><span><span><span> a college dropout and a </span></span></span><span><span><span><b>Python</b></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span><i>programmer</i></span></span></span><span><span><span>. I have been learning web development and been a Web Developer since more than a year and a half. Now I am ready to share the knowledge that I have gained and spread it to people who want to discover, achieve and realize their dreams of being a programmer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>When I started learning Python, programming blogs helped me a lot and that’s why I wanted to start one. I’m going to share whatever I have learnt so far on Python Play. Python Play will provide tips, tutorials and blog post about important programming concepts and also help the reader to become a better programmer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Self-Learning is important and by far the best way of learning I have ever found. Learning on our own, making sweet little mistakes, finding solutions and trying new methods is all self-learning about. Although it is not the fastest way to learn but how fast you learn depends on your interest, your love and your hard work.</span></span></span></p>
