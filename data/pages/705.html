<html><body><div><p>pynsist is a tool to build Windows installers for your Python applications. The
installers bundle Python itself, so you can distribute your application to
people who don’t have Python installed.</p>
<p>At present, pynsist requires Python 3.3 or above, or Python 2.7.</p>

<p>The API is not yet documented here, because I’m still working out how it should
be structured. The functions and classes have docstrings, and you’re welcome to
use them directly, though they may change in the future.</p>
