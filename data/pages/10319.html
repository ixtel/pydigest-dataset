He uses his acquired knowledge and expertise to teach a wide range of audiences how to write great software, as well.</p><p>He studied and mastered several disciplines, including mathematics, physics, and microelectronics. His thorough understanding of these subjects helped him raise his standards beyond the scope of "pragmatic solutions." He knows that true solutions should be as certain as the laws of physics, as robust as ECC memories, and as universal as mathematics.</p><p>Dimitrios now develops distributed, low-latency, highly-availability systems using the latest datacenter technologies. He is language agnostic, yet has a slight preference for Python, C++, and Java. A firm believer in open source software and hardware, he hopes that his contributions will benefit individual communities as well as all of humanity.</p><h4>Table of Contents</h4><ol><li>Introducing Scrapy</li><li>Understanding HTML and XPath</li><li>Basic Crawling</li><li>From Scrapy to a Mobile App</li><li>Quick Spider Recipes</li><li>Deploying to Scrapinghub</li><li>Configuration and Management</li><li>Programming Scrapy</li><li>Pipeline Recipes</li><li>Understanding Scrapy's Performance</li><li>Distributed Crawling with Scrapyd and Real-Time Analytics</li><li>Installing and troubleshooting prerequisite software</li></ol>       </div>
