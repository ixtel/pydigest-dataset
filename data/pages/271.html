	<h3>Overcoming Python's GIL with Cython<br/> <small>How to avoid that Python's GIL kills the performance of multithreaded programs</small></h3>
	<hr/>
	<p>Everybody is aware of the infamous <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Python’s GIL</a>. In a nutshell, the GIL is
a global variable that prevents multiple threads to be run concurrently by the
interpreter. Under some occasions, for certain operations, the interpreter
releases the GIL therefore in certain cases this is not a problem. For example,
the GIL is released before doing I/O, so I/O bound threads tend to run
concurrently. Another example is when doing system calls.
Unfortunately, for CPU bound tasks that don’t make any I/O or system calls, the
GIL prevents different threads from running concurrently, even on multicore
CPUs. The astonishing thing is that, in fact, not only different threads do not
run concurrently, but they also run slower on multicore CPUs than on single
core ones!</p>

<p>I strongly recommend you to watch David Beazley’ “Understanding the Python GIL”
lecture: it’s available as <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/python/UnderstandingGIL.pdf">slides</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph374fJqFPE">video</a>.</p>

<p>Consider this simple script, that runs twice, sequentially, a <code>busy_sleep</code>,
i.e. a function that simulate a CPU intensive task:</p>



<p>This takes 6.7 seconds to run on my laptop. Now consider the threaded version:</p>



<p>One could optimistically expect this script to run in half the time on a
multicore processor, or, pessimistically, in about the same time as the
sequential version. Instead, it runs in <em>twice the time</em> as the sequential
version: 11.1 secs on my laptop. What!?</p>

<p>The picture below shows the CPU usage for <code>seq.py</code> first and <code>par.py</code> second:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/gil.png" alt="GIL" title="CPU usage for `seq.py` and `par.py`"/>
</p>

<p>As explained very well in Beazley’s lesson, the threaded version suffers from a
very bad behaviour where the OS tries desperately to schedule the two threads
on different cores, but, because of the GIL, only one runs at a time whereas
the other is moved across cores endlessly…</p>

<p>In fact, a better behaviour is achievable forcing the OS to run the script
using just one CPU, using <code>tasksel</code>. This takes as long as the serial version:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; time taskset -c 0 python par.py
taskset -c 0 python par.py  6.64s user 0.01s system 99% cpu 6.662 total
</code></pre>

<p>There is a way to overcome the limitation imposed by the GIL for CPU bound
threads though: using <a href="http://docs.cython.org/index.html">Cython</a>. <a href="http://docs.cython.org/index.html">Cython</a> offers a wonderful context
manager to run instructions without the GIL: <a href="http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/external_C_code.html?highlight=nogil#acquiring-and-releasing-the-gil">with nogil</a>. The catch is that
it can only be used to run code that does not touch any Python object.</p>

<p>I’ve implemented the above example in Cython to show the effect of <code>nogil</code>.
(Note: <code>_busy_sleep</code>, by being implemented in pure C, runs faster that its
Python’s counterpart, so the C version does a bit more useless operations –
<code>** 0.5</code> a couple of times – to make its busy times comparable).</p>




<pre><code>$&gt; python test_parpyx.py
SEQ Elapsed: 10.1856
PAR Elapsed: 5.4503
</code></pre>

<p>Yey! The parallel version takes half the time as the sequential one! Note that
had we used <code>parpyx.busy_sleep</code> instead of <code>parpyx.busy_sleep_nogil</code> in the
<code>Thread</code>s we would not have run anything in parallel.</p>

<p>Below is the annotated version of the <code>_busy_sleep</code> function that shows how, by
being “all white”, no calls to Python’s objects are done and, therefore, it can
be called <code>with nogil</code>:</p>
