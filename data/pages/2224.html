<p>Consider the following sample code:</p>

<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""Test module."""


def test():
    """Tets function"""
    return 10
</code></pre>

<p><code>pylint</code> gives it 10 of 10, <code>flake8</code> doesn't find any warnings:</p>

<pre><code>$ pylint test.py 
...
Global evaluation
-----------------
Your code has been rated at 10.00/10
...
$ flake8 test.py
$
</code></pre>

<p>But, as you may see, there is a typo in the <code>test</code> function's docstring. And, your editor would probably highlight it automagically, for example, here's how Pycharm does it:</p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2151300/whats-the-best-way-to-spell-check-python-source-code">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2151300/whats-the-best-way-to-spell-check-python-source-code</a> topic, now I know that there is a relevant spell-checking library called <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/" rel="nofollow"><code>PyEnchant</code></a> that can be used to detect typos.</p>

<p>My end goal is to <em>automatically detect typos in the project</em> and make the spell check a part of a continuous build, test and code-quality check run. </p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve that with <code>pylint</code>? If not, I would also appreciate any hints on applying <code>PyEnchant</code> to docstrings and comments project-wise (in this case, <code>pylint</code> or <code>pyflakes</code> plugin could be made out of it).</p>

<p><sup>Please, also, let me know if I'm getting insanely concerned about the code quality.</sup></p>
