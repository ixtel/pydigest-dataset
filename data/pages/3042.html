<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Baptiste Mispelon</strong> on January 30, 2015 </span>

<p>The Django team is thrilled to announce the addition of two new members.</p>
<p>For those who don't know them, <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/asendecka">Ola Sendecka</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/olasitarska/">Ola Sitarska</a> have been a fixture of our community for several years now.</p>
<p>They have organized numerous Django events in Europe (some of you still probably remember the famous <a class="reference external" href="http://love.djangocircus.com/">Django Circus</a>).
Last year, they also started the <a class="reference external" href="http://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a> community which has grown immensely (so far, there have been 18 workshops in 4 continents and more are to come).
More recently, they've also been instrumental in shipping the new redesign of the Django website as well as our latest <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/">fundraising campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Ola Sendecka will soon be living in London, UK and works remotely for <a class="reference external" href="https://www.legalsense.nl/">Legalsense</a>. She's also co-organized numerous Django sprints in Krakow, Poland.</p>
<p>Ola Sitarska also lives in London where she makes awesome things happen at <a class="reference external" href="https://p.ota.to/">Potato</a>. Amongst many other events, she's on the organizing committee of the upcoming <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/">DjangoCon Europe</a> where she's focusing her efforts on diversity and outreach.</p>
<p>We couldn't be more grateful for their contributions and we look forward to have them share their enthusiasm and talent with the rest of the team.</p>
