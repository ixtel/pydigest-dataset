<p> </p>
<p>Now that we have a pipeline for drawing the shapes of stories, we need a better test. The first step is to find data.</p>
<p>To validate Vonnegut’s hypothesis, I initially wanted to score the same stories he described. But I’ve only read Hamlet once, and that was more than enough. Vonnegut’s stories may be archetypal fiction plots, but for me it was very hard to validate performance when I couldn’t remember the context and sequence of events from those stories. Wait a second…he mentioned the Cinderella story, everyone knows that one, right?</p>
<p>I searched the web for a canonical version of Cinderella, but quickly discovered that the myth has dozens of variations. Having been exposed to many versions since childhood, it was impossible to attribute my interpretation of the Cinderella story to any single context or version. Turns out academics hypothesize how each version of Cinderella reflects the culture from whence it came…what a mess! This is the opposite of a good test for validating the performance of our plotlines. We want authoritative versions.</p>
<p>Finally, thinking <em>“what is the most popular version of cinderella?”</em>…I definitely remember watching Disney’s version of Cinderella! Were movies scripts a better test than written stories?</p>
<p>It turns out that movies have a number of useful constraints for the task at hand. Written stories are typically consumed in many sittings, many contexts, over many hours, but movies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>time-boxed and consumed all in a single sitting/context</li>
<li>sequences of events are more memorable when they occur on-screen as audio-visual media vs. written as text (for me, at least)</li>
<li>have similar lengths</li>
<li>every movie has a script, either the original or transcriptions produced by fans</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a good script of Disney’s 1950 version of Cinderella freely available on the web. However, fans have transcribed many other movies, including The Lion King, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, and more:</p>
