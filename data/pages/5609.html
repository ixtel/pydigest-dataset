<p>In this notebook I show how you can draw a map of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles">Britain and Ireland</a> from location data using the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/">Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit</a>. The data points that will be drawn are pub locations extracted from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and provided by <a href="http://osm-x-tractor.org/Data.aspx">osm-x-tractor</a>.</p>
<p>When you download and extract the Points Of Interest (POI) dataset as a CSV file it has a file size of about 800 MB and more than 9 million entries for different types of locations. To filter out only the locations tagged as pubs you can use csvgrep, which is part of the <a href="http://csvkit.readthedocs.org/">csvkit toolkit</a>.</p>

<pre><code>csvgrep -c amenity -m pub POIWorld.csv &gt; POIWorld-pub.csv

</code></pre>
<p>The resulting CSV file is much smaller with a size of 7.7 MB and contains a little more than 120,000 entries for pub locations all over the world. Since the coverage varies across countries and regions, I chose to limit the map to Britain and Ireland where POI coverage seems quite comprehensive and there are a lot of pubs. Who could have thought?</p>
<p>Next we load the required libraries and define a function that checks whether a given location tuple is within the given bounding box.</p>
