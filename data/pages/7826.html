<h2>Boto 3</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3" rel="nofollow">Boto3</a>, the next version of Boto, is now
stable and recommended for general use.  It can be used side-by-side with Boto
in the same project, so it is easy to start using Boto3 in your existing
projects as well as new projects. Going forward, API updates and all new
feature work will be focused on Boto3.</p>
<p>To assist users who still depend on Boto and cannot immediately switch over, we
will be triaging and addressing critical issues and PRs in Boto in the short
term. As more users make the switch to Boto3, we expect to reduce our
maintenance involvement over time. If we decide on a cutoff date or any
significant changes to our maintenance plan, we will make pre-announcements
well ahead of schedule to allow ample time for our users to adapt/migrate.</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.
Currently, all features work with Python 2.6 and 2.7. Work is under way to
support Python 3.3+ in the same codebase. Modules are being ported one at
a time with the help of the open source community, so please check below
for compatibility with Python 3.3+.</p>
<p>To port a module to Python 3.3+, please view our <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING" rel="nofollow">Contributing Guidelines</a>
and the <a href="http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/porting_guide.html" rel="nofollow">Porting Guide</a>. If you would like, you can open an issue to let
others know about your work in progress. Tests <strong>must</strong> pass on Python
2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4 for pull requests to be accepted.</p>

<p>The goal of boto is to support the full breadth and depth of Amazon
Web Services.  In addition, boto provides support for other public
services such as Google Storage in addition to private cloud systems
like Eucalyptus, OpenStack and Open Nebula.</p>
<p>Boto is developed mainly using Python 2.6.6 and Python 2.7.3 on Mac OSX
and Ubuntu Maverick.  It is known to work on other Linux distributions
and on Windows.  Most of Boto requires no additional libraries or packages
other than those that are distributed with Python.  Efforts are made
to keep boto compatible with Python 2.5.x but no guarantees are made.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Boto</h2>
<p>Your credentials can be passed into the methods that create
connections.  Alternatively, boto will check for the existence of the
following environment variables to ascertain your credentials:</p>
<p><strong>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</strong> - Your AWS Access Key ID</p>
<p><strong>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</strong> - Your AWS Secret Access Key</p>
<p>Credentials and other boto-related settings can also be stored in a
boto config file.  See <a href="http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> for details.</p>
