<p>Along side the other answers that mentioned the precedence of <code>not</code> is lower than <code>in</code>, actually your statement is equivalent to :</p>

<pre><code>not (True in [False, True])
</code></pre>

<p>But note that if you don't separate your condition from others python will use 2 role <code>precedence</code> or <code>chaining</code> to separate that,and in this case python used precedence, also note that if you want to separate a condition you need to put all the condition in parenthesis not just the object or value :</p>

<pre><code>(not True) in [False, True]
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>But as mentioned, there is another modification by python on operators that is <strong>chaining</strong>:</p>

<p>Based on python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow"><em>documentation</em></a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that comparisons, membership tests, and identity tests, all have the same precedence and have a left-to-right <strong>chaining</strong> feature as described in the Comparisons section.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example the result of following statement is <code>False</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; True == False in [False, True]
False
</code></pre>

<p>Because python will chain the statements like following :</p>

<pre><code>(True == False) and (False in [False, True])
</code></pre>

<p>Which exactly is <code>False and True</code> that is <code>False</code>. </p>

<p>You can assume that the central object will be shared between 2 operations and other objects (False in this case).</p>

<p>And note that its also true for all Comparisons, including membership tests and identity tests operations which are following operands :</p>

<pre><code>in, not in, is, is not, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, !=, ==
</code></pre>

<p>Example :</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 in [1,2] == True
False
</code></pre>

<p>Another famous example is number range :</p>

<pre><code>7&lt;x&lt;20
</code></pre>

<p>which is equal to :</p>

<pre><code>7&lt;x and x&lt;20   
</code></pre>
