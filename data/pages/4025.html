<span><a href="http://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part2/" target="_blank">Let's Build A Web Server. Part 2.</a></span><br/>
Remember, in Part 1 I asked you a question: "How do you run a Django application, Flask application, and Pyramid application under your freshly minted Web server without making a single change to the server to accommodate all those different Web frameworks?" Read on to find out the answer.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/show/2/python-and-mongodb" target="_blank">Episode #2: Python and MongoDB</a></span><br/>
In this show we speak with Jesse Davis from MongoDB. Jesse is the maintainer for a number of popular open-source projects including the Python MongoDB driver known as PyMongo and Mongo C (for C/C++ developers, yes you read right! C developers). Jesse discusses how interesting it is to write both Python and C code and how it reawakens part of the brain. You'll learn a little about MongoDB, how it compares to RDBMSes as well as other NoSQL data stores. <br/>

<span><a href="http://www.aicbt.com/raspberry-pi-sleep-monitor/" target="_blank">LittleSleeper: A baby sleep monitor using a Raspberry Pi and Python</a></span><br/>
This post presents an open-source "sleep monitor" using a Raspberry Pi, a USB microphone and some Python. The Raspberry Pi is perfect for this project as it is much cheaper than a baby monitor, and uses very little power.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-01-29/ml_advice.html" target="_blank">Advice for applying Machine Learning</a></span><br/>
This post is based on a tutorial given in a machine learning course at University of Bremen. It summarizes some recommendations on how to get started with machine learning on a new problem. This includes ways of visualizing your data, choosing a machine learning method suitable for the problem at hand, identifying and dealing with over- and underfitting, dealing with large (read: not very small) datasets, pros and cons of different loss functions.<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXkThJVbTdU" target="_blank">How to Build Account Harvesters and Password Guessers with Python</a></span><br/>
Mike Murr shows you how to enhance your pen tests by building custom tools in Python. Specifically, Mike will show you how to build an account harvester and password guesser for web applications. You'll learn the process from start to finish for designing, building, and using custom tools. <br/>

<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elojMnjn4kk" target="_blank">What is machine learning, and how does it work?</a></span><br/>
This is the first video in the series: "Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn". Kevin gives you his definition, provide some examples of machine learning, and explain at a high level how machine learning "works".<br/>
<br/>
<span><a href="http://ioam.github.io/holoviews/Examples/Logistic_Map.html" target="_blank">Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map using HoloViews</a></span><br/>
In this tutorial, we will see how to implement Geoff Boeing's excellent <a href="http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map using our newly release library, HoloViews. For an example of how this material may be approached using pandas and matplotlib directly please see Geoff's original notebook. We will see how using HoloViews allows the same content to be expressed in a far more succinct way that also makes the material presented easier to understand for the reader. In particular, we will show how composing Layout and Overlay objects makes it easier to compare data side-by-side, without needing to scroll vertically between plots.<br/>

This book primarily targets programmers and aspiring data scientists who have already taken their first steps in Python and would want to learn and bring the power of machine learning to their new projects. For those who would like to add machine learning support into their existing projects, this book would be equally beneficial. It's also intended for everyone who would like to learn how to use Python's machine learning capabilities and gain valuable insight from data to develop effective solutions for business problems.<br/>
