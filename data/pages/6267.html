The Try Django Tutorial Series is designed to help you get used to using Django in building a basic landing page (also known as splash page or MVP landing page) so you can collect data from potential users. Collecting this data will prove as verification (or validation) that your project is worth building. Furthermore, we also show you how to implement a Paypal Button so you can also accept payments. <br/>
<br/>
Django is awesome and very simple to get started. Step-by-step tutorials are to help you understand the workflow, get you started doing something real, then it is our goal to have you asking questions... "Why did I do X?" or "How would I do Y?" These are questions you wouldn't know to ask otherwise. Questions, after all, lead to answers.<br/>
