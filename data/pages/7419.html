<p><strong>Overview</strong>  <br/></p>
<p>You are invited to learn and practice Python basics at the Philly Python Workshop! This event is for people who have little or no programming experience. </p>
<p><span>This is a 1.5 day event, with sessions on <strong>Friday November 20 from 6 PM to 9 PM</strong> and <strong>Saturday November 21 from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM</strong>. You must be able to the attend the full session both days to participate.</span></p>
<p><span>On Friday evening </span><span>you'll set up your development environment, learn how to execute Python code from a file and interactively from a Python prompt, and practice printing to the screen and using Python as a calculator.</span>  <br/></p>
<p>We'll spend Saturday on a lecture based introduction to Python, taking breaks to practice concepts on bite-sized exercises. We'll also practice Python through short projects on a variety of fun and practical topics.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a comfortable environment where people can develop their programming skills with confidence. Instructors from PhillyPUG will be friendly guides throughout the event.</p>

<p><strong><span>Things to bring on Friday and Saturday</span></strong></p>
<p>Your laptop computer that you have admin privileges on, running a recent version of Linux, Mac OS, or Windows, and power cord. No other prior set up is required.  Note you will not be able to get the full experience on a Chromebook, tablet, or similar device.  Also, bring a water bottle, notebooks and pens, and anything else you need to help you learn.  </p>
<p>Feel free to bring your own dinner Friday.  We'll have coffee Saturday morning and lunch on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong><span>Workshop fee: $30</span></strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing our cost goes to is guaranteeing your spot.  We've all been to events where more people RSVP than actually attend and this is a safeguard against that.  However we are not making any money off of this.  Instructors are all volunteers.  Your fee will cover some basic costs but if you can not afford the fee, we will gladly offer a reduced rate or waive the fee altogether.  No need to apply for a scholarship - just ask. No one is turned away due to cost.</p>
<p>Participants are expected to follow the Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct, found here: <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/" class="linkified">https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/</a>.</p>
