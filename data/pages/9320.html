                    <p>While <a class="reference external" href="http://audreyr.com/">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a> and I were contemplating our next Two Scoops Press book topic, it came down to a decision between Pyramid, Flask, and mythical creatures. Inspired by Django's magical flying pony, Pyramid's scary alien dude, and even the idea of a magical Flask pouring out wonderful projects, we've decided to go with mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Specifically, we're writing about goblins, hence the title of this blog post.</p>
<p>What that means is that the next book we publish will be fantasy. Going forward all the books we write will be fiction.</p>
<p>If we ever write a new <a class="reference external" href="http://twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6">Two Scoops of Django</a> book, it will be a fantasy about a magical flying pony who eats ice cream. That way we'll confuse the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=django&amp;tag=mlinar-20">already muddled Amazon.com search requests for 'Django'</a> even more.</p>
<p>Since this is a technical blog, I'll be moving my fiction writing based articles to my author blog at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.danielroygreenfeld.com">danielroygreenfeld.com</a>.</p>
