<h2>What is Functional Programming ?</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional Programming</a> is when functions, not objects or procedures, are the fundamental building blocks of a program. The idea is that you can pass functions as parameters to other functions and return them as values. Functional programming involves writing code that does not change state. The primary reason for doing so is so that successive calls to a function will yield the same result. You can write functional code in any language that supports first-class functions, but there are some languages, like Haskell, which do not allow you to change state. In fact, you’re not supposed to make any side effects (like printing out text) at all – which sounds like it could be completely useless.</p>
