            <h2>Who Can Use TensorFlow?</h2>
            <p>TensorFlow is for everyone.  It's for students, researchers, hobbyists, hackers, engineers, developers, inventors and innovators and is being open sourced under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache 2.0 open source license</a>.</p>
            <p>TensorFlow is not complete; it is intended to be built upon and extended. We have made an initial release of the source code, and continue to work actively to make it better. We hope to build an active open source community that drives the future of this library, both by providing feedback and by actively contributing to the source code.</p>

            <h2>Why Did Google Open Source This?</h2>
            <p>If TensorFlow is so great, why open source it rather than keep it proprietary? The answer is simpler than you might think:  We believe that machine learning is a key ingredient to the innovative products and technologies of the future. Research in this area is global and growing fast, but lacks standard tools. By sharing what we believe to be one of the best machine learning toolboxes in the world, we hope to create an open standard for exchanging research ideas and putting machine learning in products. Google engineers really do use TensorFlow in user-facing products and services, and our research group intends to share TensorFlow implementations along side many of our research publications.</p>
