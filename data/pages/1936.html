Feel free to send me a message as well. <br/><br/>In this video we will go on a tough journey of taking an existing app with no restful service and getting it working with a brand new restful api as well as serving Angularjs from the client side on a Django server stack.   This is a pretty complex subject and I try to do the best I can to make sure I'm not moving too fast.  If you have any questions please feel free to leave a comment.
