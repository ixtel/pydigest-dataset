<p>On February 10, meetup with Python / Data enthusiasts and learn more about Dataswarm and Ibis.  </p> 
<p>We are soliciting lighting and full length talks for the coming year. Please submit <span>a 5-min lightning talk </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LtV839ktupRboMUSXlXqoJ9lLFvpe-TZtLCf2q6jUpY/viewform?usp=send_form"><strong>here</strong></a><span>.  Please submit a 20, 30, or 45 mins tech talk proposal <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pqYxgSghDLDPbzO9O_2fFJulqNQNRc8jgz33SIh9WZs/viewform">here</a>.</b>  </span></p>
<p><b>Lightning talks: </b></p> 
<p>Scientific data set management: A lesson learned from building the Classical Language Toolkit by Kyle Johnson</p>
<p>Building a Hexastore in Python by Daniel Pyrathon </p> 
<p>Using DeepDive for meta-analysis by Eva Vivalt <br/></p>
<p><strong>Talk #1</strong> <b> Dataswarm</b></p> 
<p><span><b>Abstract:  </b></span><span>At Facebook, data is used to gain insights for existing products and drive development of new products. In order to do this, engineers and analysts need to seamlessly process data across a variety of backend data stores. Dataswarm is a framework for writing data processing pipelines in Python. Using an extensible library of operations (e.g. executing queries, moving data, running scripts), developers programmatically define dependency graphs of tasks to be executed. Dataswarm takes care of the rest: distributed execution, scheduling, and dependency management. Talk will cover high level design, example pipeline code, and plans for the future.</span></p> 
<p><span><b>Bio: </b>Mike Starr is a software engineer in Facebook’s Data Infrastructure organization. During the previous 3 years, Mike has worked on Facebook's distributed scheduler, “Chronos”, and ETL solution, “Dataswarm." Prior to Facebook, Mike came from Wisconsin (land of beer, brats, and cheese) where he earned his B.S. in Computer Science and Computer Engineering at UW-Madison.<a href="http://pydata.org/sv2014/speakers/#268_"/> <br/></span></p> 
<p><span><b>Talk #2  </b></span><span><b>Using Python at Scale for Data Science</b></span></p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>  <span>While Python is a de-facto language for modern data engineering and data science, Python development has been confined to local data processing—thereby limiting its users to smaller data sets. Historically, to address bigger data workloads, Python developers have had to extract samples or aggregates, forcing compromises in data fidelity, adding ETL costs, and ultimately leading to a loss of productivity and addressable use cases. Ibis, a new open source data analytics framework for Python developers, has the goal of enabling the Python data ecosystem (NumPy, pandas, etc.) to operate efficiently at Hadoop scale. To enable high performance Python at scale without the age-old JVM interoperability problems, Ibis take advantage of unique synergies between Python and Impala, the leading open source MPP analytical query engine. In this talk, Ibis creator Wes McKinney will demo the current capabilities of Ibis as well as explain its roadmap.</span></p>
