<p>The Murano Dashboard</p>








<p>Murano Project introduces an application catalog, which allows application
developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready
applications in a browsable categorised catalog. Cloud users
— including inexperienced ones — can then use the catalog to
compose reliable application environments with the push of a button.</p>
<div id="murano-dashboard">
<h2>Murano Dashboard</h2>
<p>Murano Dashboard is an extension for OpenStack Dashboard that provides a UI for

<p>For developer purposes, please place OpenStack Dashboard extension file, located
at <em>local/_50_murano.py</em> under horizon/openstack_dashboard/local/enabled
