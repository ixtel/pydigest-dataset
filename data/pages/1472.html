For what its worth, I was able to compile the C module with little difficulty (just had to change unistd to winsock2, and use cmake to build the appropriate sln file for windows), just when I actually wanted to link the underlying module (_librabbitmq) it wanted to link against Python.lib</p><p>For what its worth, I don't think the silent error is your fault, attempting to install using pip also silently fails, and to even get a hint that there is an issue, you have to try using the setup file and then realize that warnings (not errors) are thrown about an empty build dir.</p><p>Much appreciated, and thanks for the great tools.</p>
