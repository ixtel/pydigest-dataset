<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We would like to show you a short update on the PyPy funding.
We gathered a total of $15,986 in the month of September and as per
<a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2014/09/python-software-foundation-matching.html">earlier agreement</a>, the Python Software Foundation donated $10,000
to PyPy. We would like to thank everyone participating and the PSF in
particular for supporting the PyPy project and making our work possible!</p>
<p>We've been working hard on the goals outlined in the funding proposals.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2014/10/pypy3-240-released.html">PyPy Python 3</a> support has been in beta for a while and it's already
being used by many people, as seen per the number of reported bugs.
We're currently supporting 3.2, planning on moving towards 3.4 in the
future.</li>
<li>Software Transactional Memory has been a successful research project,
with <a class="reference external" href="http://morepypy.blogspot.com/2014/11/tornado-without-gil-on-pypy-stm.html">first real world</a> results shown during the Warsaw sprint.</li>
<li>More detailed update on numpy will be published soon. A little spoiler is
that we're planning on addressing matplotlib, scipy and the larger ecosystem
to some extent. Stay tuned!</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, thanks to everyone who donated and happy Thanksgiving to everyone
on that side of the world!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
fijal and the entire PyPy team</p>
