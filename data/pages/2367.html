<p>I've spent a bit of time writing the somewhat grandiosely titled <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web.html">A
Review of the Web</a>, and I think it's a neat addition to the
documentation of the <a class="reference external" href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org">Morepath</a> web framework.</p>
<p>It attempts to do two things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Help those developers who aren't as familiar yet with the details of
web technology to get a handle on various concepts surrounding web
frameworks and web services.</li>
<li>Show to developers who <em>are</em> more familiar with these concepts how
Morepath fits in as a web framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this document fulfill either purpose? Let me know!</p>
