<p>I'm in the process of automating lab instruments.
I have a requirement like function will send file/binary data via VISA GPIB from Host PC to instrument.</p>

<p>In Ni4882.h there is the following functions to transfer file/binary data in Visual studio 2010, and it is working. I have well versed in the sending command as GPIB string.</p>

<p>But I never came across sending the file through GPIB command.</p>

<p>These are functions I tried in c++.  I used ni4882.obj file (have the definition of these functions) and created an application, So I was able to  transfer a file PC to instruments. But I am not able to find equivalent functions in python</p>

<pre><code>unsigned long NI488CC ibwrtfA  (int ud, const char * filename);
unsigned long NI488CC ibwrtfW  (int ud, const wchar_t * filename);
</code></pre>

<p>Could anyone please let me know the equivalent function in pyvisa or visa python package? --or-- any equivalent module to an alternative for this.</p>

<p>I browse through all the functions of pyvisa and visa, but I failed to find the equivalent functions.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>
