<h1>Evolution
of a binary search implementation for line-sorted text files</h1>


<p>Let's suppose you have a sorted text file, in which each line is
lexicographically larger than the previous one, and you want to find a
specific range of lines, or all lines with a specific prefix. This article
explains the design and implementation details a software which can do that
for you. If you are not interested in the details, you can
<a href="http://github.com/pts/pts-line-bisect">get the software</a> and use
it. Use the C implementation for maximum speed. There is also a Python
implementation which is easier to understand, reuse as a library and extend
(but it's slower: it does more lseek(2) and read(2) operations on the file,
and it also uses a bit more CPU).

</p><p>Usage instructions are not included here, see the
<a href="https://github.com/pts/pts-line-bisect">pts-line-bisect project page</a>
showing the README for that.

</p><p>A typical real-word use case for such a binary search tool is retrieving
lines corresponding to a particular time range in log files (or time based
measurement records). These files text files with variable-length lines, with
the log timestamp in the beginning of the line, and they are generated in
increasing timestamp order. Unfortunately the lines are not lexicographically
sorted, so the timestamp has to be decoded first for the comparison.
The <a href="https://code.google.com/p/bsearch/">bsearch</a> tool does that,
it also supports parsing arbitrary, user-specifiable datetime formats, and it
can binary search in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip">gzip(1)</a>ped files as well
(by building an index). It's also of high performance and low overhead,
partially because it is written in C++. So <i>bsearch</i> is practical tool
with lots of useful features.

</p><p>In this article we take a more pure approach
though, and assume that the lines of the input text file are lexicographically
sorted, and we don't do any decoding. We also assume that lines are spearated
by <code>'\n'</code> (= 10) bytes. These assumptions work for ASCII, UTF-8 and
ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) text. They also work for numbers and dates if they are
zero-padded (or space-padded), right-aligned, and rendered at constant width.

</p><p>If each line has the same length, then a simple binary search can be used
to find the interesting range of lines in O(<i>s</i> Â· log <i>n</i>) time
(where <i>n</i> is the number of lines and <i>s</i> is the length of each
line). Actually there are two caveats: two binary search searches are
needed (one for the start of the interval and one for the end), and
implementing a binary search can be tricky because of corner cases and
possible off-by-one errors. We'll address these later below.

<h3>Understanding bisection and binary search</h3>

<p>Here is a Python implementation (also available in the built-in
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/bisect.html">bisect</a> module)
for finding the start of the interval in a sorted list:

</p><pre class="syntax"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bisect_left</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">lo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hi</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="sd">"""Return the index where to insert item x in list a, assuming a is sorted.</span>

<span class="sd">  The return value i is such that all e in a[:i] have e &lt; x, and all e in</span>
<span class="sd">  a[i:] have e &gt;= x.  So if x already appears in the list, a.insert(x) will</span>
<span class="sd">  insert just before the leftmost x already there.</span>

<span class="sd">  Optional args lo (default 0) and hi (default len(a)) bound the</span>
<span class="sd">  slice of a to be searched.</span>
<span class="sd">  """</span>

  <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">hi</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">hi</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">mid</span><span class="p">]:</span>  <span class="c"># Change `&lt;=' to `&lt;', and you get bisect_right.</span>
      <span class="n">hi</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mid</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="n">lo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mid</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">lo</span></pre>

<p>To avoid the corner case bugs, pay attention to <code>&lt;=</code> versus
<code>&lt;</code>, and the <code>+1</code> in <code>mid+1</code>.
<i>bisect_right</i> finds the end of the interval. Its implementation is
almost the same, you just have to change a <code>&lt;=</code> to
<code>&lt;</code>. Here is how you can use <i>bisect_left</i> and
<i>bisect_right</i> to find an remove a range from a list:

</p><pre class="syntax"><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">30</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">end</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">bisect_left</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">bisect_right</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">end</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">start</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">end</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">60</span><span class="p">]</span></pre>

<p>The choice of the meaning of the arguments in and the return value
<i>bisect_left</i> and <i>bisect_right</i> is smart, because it avoids most
of the off-by-one errors and most of the related confusion. C++ has
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/lower_bound">std::lower_bound</a>
and
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/lower_bound">std::upper_bound</a>
(respectively) with the same design, but it uses iterators instead of
indexes. It is straightforward to port <i>bisect_left</i> and
<i>bisect_right</i> to C, using either indexes or pointers.

</p><p>If you need binary search to find a specific element of a sorted list,
you can use <i>bisect_left</i> and check if the element at the index
returned is indeed there. You need the check, because <i>bisect_left</i>
returns a meaningful value (i.e. an insertion offset) even if the element
you are looking for is missing. As an alternative, you can use
<i>bisect_right</i>, subtract 1 from the index, and see if it's there.
Don't forget to do a range check before indexing.

</p><h3>Binary search in a text file with variable line length</h3>

<p>The basic idea is to do the bisection (index halving) on the byte positions,
but compare whole lines. This sounds like useless, because if we seek to the
middle of the file in the beginning, we might end up in the middle of a
line, and that's useless for comparison. There are two natural fixes for
that: F1. after the seek, find the beginning of the line; F2. after the
seek, find the end of the line. They both look feasible, but we are a bit
afraid of introducing corner case bugs.

</p><p>Let's choose F2, because F1 needs
scanning backwards in a file, and the implementation of that sounds ugly.
A naÃ¯ve implementation of F2:

<p>Three obvious bugs: B1. that it will never find the line in the beginning
of the file; B2. if <i>x</i> should be inserted to the end of the file, the
bisection makes the wrong decision, because the 2nd
<code>f.readline()</code> returns an empty string on EOF; B3. the return value
doesn't contain the offset of the actual line, but it's in the previous line.
Surprisingly, there
are no other bugs (see the proof later). Luckily, it's easy to fix these bugs.
Interestingly, the first 10 Google search results for
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=binary%20search%20text%20file&amp;hl=en">binary
search text file</a> show many pieces of code (Java, Python, C#) using the same
design (i.e. calling <i>readline</i> twice), and most of them contain both
bugs B1 and B2,
and neither the authors nor the commenters bothered fixing them.

</p><p>Here is how to fix bug B1: If <i>mid</i> is 0, then skip the first
<i>readline</i>, otherwise seek to <i>mid</i> - 1 (rather than <i>mid</i>),
and do both <i>readline</i>s. It's easy to see that we need both of these
changes, e.g. if the file starts with 2 <code>\n</code>s, only with both
changes will the program find both empty lines (the first one at offset 0,
the second one at offset 1).

</p><p>Here is how to fix bug B2: If the second <i>readline</i> has returned an
empty string (because of EOF), force the condition to be false (meaning that
the position we're looking for is before EOF), thus
<code>hi = mid</code> would be executed, moving backwards, away from EOF.

</p><p>Here is how to fix bug B3: Remember the file offset (using
<code>f.tell</code>) just before the 2nd <i>readline</i>, and return that.

</p><p>These are easy fixes, but they make the code a bit less elegant a bit
longer. The following solution also contains a few shortcuts to speed up
execution in corner cases.

<p>See the comments in the code above to how it can be changed to
<i>bisect_right</i> (only one shortcut has to be removed and the usual
change from <code>&lt;=</code> to <code>&lt;</code> in the line comparison).

</p><p>Please note that we've dropped the arguments <i>lo</i> and <i>hi</i>,
because the internal <i>lo</i> and <i>hi</i> variables are not meaningful to
the caller, because they don't start at the line boundary. It would possible
to add back support using manual forward or backward scanning for a
<code>\n</code> in the beginning, but I omitted that here, beause I couldn't
find a compelling use case for such an ugly piece of code.

</p><p>It looks like we've completely solved the problem. But in fact we haven't
proven the correctness (i.e. that the functions return exactly those line
offsets which their docstring describes), and we haven't yet optimized for
I/O speed.

</p><p>For the proof of correctness we can reduce this algorithm to the
<i>bisect_left</i> for lists, and use the fact that that one is correct. For
example, let's consider the input file:

</p><pre>ab
foo
world
zip</pre>

<p>And then see that at which <i>mid</i> offset which <i>line</i> is read:

</p><p>
</p><table class="i"><thead><tr><td>mid</td><td>midf</td><td>line</td></tr></thead>
<tr><td class="r">0</td><td class="r"> 0</td><td>ab</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">1</td><td class="r"> 3</td><td>foo</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">2</td><td class="r"> 3</td><td>foo</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">3</td><td class="r"> 3</td><td>foo</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">4</td><td class="r"> 7</td><td>world</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">5</td><td class="r"> 7</td><td>world</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">6</td><td class="r"> 7</td><td>world</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">7</td><td class="r"> 7</td><td>world</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">8</td><td class="r">13</td><td>zip</td></tr>
</table>
Â Â Â 
<table class="i">
<thead><tr><td>mid</td><td>midf</td><td>line</td></tr></thead>
<tr><td class="r"> 9</td><td class="r">13</td><td>zip</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">10</td><td class="r">13</td><td>zip</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">11</td><td class="r">13</td><td>zip</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">12</td><td class="r">13</td><td>zip</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">13</td><td class="r">13</td><td>zip</td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">14</td><td class="r">17</td><td><i>(EOF)</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">15</td><td class="r">17</td><td><i>(EOF)</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">16</td><td class="r">17</td><td><i>(EOF)</i></td></tr>
<tr><td class="r">17</td><td class="r">17</td><td><i>(EOF)</i></td></tr>
</table>

<p>It looks like that each line (except for the first) is repeated as many
times as the length of the previous line (including the trailing
<code>\n</code>). It will turn out that the amount of duplication doesn't
matter as long as there are no lines removed.

</p><p>The key observation: If we duplicate some strings in a sorted list, it
will still remain sorted, thus <i>bisect_left</i> and <i>bisect_right</i>
give correct results (with the inflated indexes), no matter how many times
the individual lines were duplicated. So what the line offset-based
<i>bisect_left</i> above does is that it emulates a longer, inflated list of
lines, and does a binary search it. The result is an offset within the
inflated list, but, because we've fixed B2, before returning it,
<i>bisect_left</i> converts the result to the offset the user is interested
in (i.e. converting <i>lo</i> from <i>mid</i> to <i>midf</i> offset). To
conclude the proof, we need to check if the correct translation happens at
EOF; and it indeed does (because we've fixed B2).

</p><h3>The full, slow implementation in Python</h3>

<p>See below the full implementation of <i>bisect_right</i> as well, and
also a new convenience function <i>bisect_interval</i>, which calls
<i>bisect_left</i> for the interval start and <i>bisect_right</i> for the

<p>All this is a long piece of code (partially because of the docstrings), but
it doesn't contain any new ideas or any surprises.

</p><p>The 2nd call to <i>bisect_way</i> in <i>bisect_interval</i> above
seems to seems to be doing
unnecessary work to find the interval start offset, because we already know
that it won't be larger than <i>end</i>. If it was possible to restrict the
search to the prefix of the file, limiting it at a specific offset,
<i>bisect_interval</i> would be faster. Let's introduce a <i>size</i>
argument for that to each function. Only the <i>_read_and_compare</i>
changes significantly, the others just pass the <i>size</i> around:

<p>Please note that the 2nd call to <i>bisect_way</i> in <i>bisect_interval</i>
above passes <i>end</i> instead of <i>size</i>; this is how the optimization
was implemented. Much work in the dependencies, a single call argument
change in the final location.

</p><h3>Reducing the number of I/O operations</h3>

<p>In an external (file-based) binary search the slowest operation is the
disk seek needed for each bisection. Most of the software and hardware
components would be waiting for the hard disk to move the reading head.
(Except, of course, that seek times are negligible when non-spinning storage
hardware such as SSD or memory card is used.)

</p><p>An out-of-the box solution would be adding the data to more
disk-efficient key-value store. There are several programs providing such
stores. Most of them are based on a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-tree</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B*-tree#Variants">B*-tree</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B+_tree">B+-tree</a> data structure if
sorted iteration and range searches have to be supported, or
disk-based
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hashtables</a> otherwise.
Some of the high-performance single-machine key-value stores:
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html">cdb</a> (read-only),
<a href="http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/">Tokyo Cabinet</a>,
<a href="http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/">Kyoto Cabinet</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">LevelDB</a>;
see more in the <a href="http://nosql-database.org/">NoSQL software list</a>.

</p><p>The fundamental speed difference between a B-tree search and a binary
search in a sorted list stems from the fact that B-trees have a branching
factor larger than 2 (possibly 100s or 1000s), thus each seeking step in a
B-tree search reduces possible input size by a factor larger than 2, while
in a binary search each step reduces the the input size by a factor 2 only
(i.e. we keep either the bottom half or the top half). So both kinds of
searches are logarithmic, but the base of the logarithm is different, and
this causes a constant factor difference in the disk seek count. By careful
tunig of the constant in B-trees it's usual to have only 2 or 3 disk seeks
for each search even for 100GB of data, while a binary search in a such
a large file with 50 bytes per record would need 31 disk seeks. By taking
10ms as the seek time (see more info about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive#Seek_time">typical
hard disk seek times</a>), a typical B-tree search takes 0.03 second, and a
typical binary search takes 0.31 second.

</p><p>In searches the disk seek time usually subsumes disk read times and other
data processing times (such as comparing the strings in memory or copying
data from one memory buffer to another). So if we want an in-the-box
solution to improve the speed of our text file binary search, we should do
as few seeks as possible. As it is now, the code does an
<code>f.seek(...)</code> call for each bisection, and the design of the
binary search doesn't let us do fewer, so it seems that there is no room for
improvement. But it is: because we can change it so that not every
<code>f.seek(...)</code> call would require a seek in the kernel
(i.e. the lseek(2)) system call).

</p><p>Before making such a change, let's remember that most I/O libraries
provide input buffering by default. (These include the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#file-objects">file</a>
object, the Ruby
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/File.html">file object</a>,
the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/open.html">files opened in
Perl</a>, the C <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/stdio.3.html">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</a>
functions
and the C++ <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io">std::istream</a>
class hierarchy. In Java one has to create a
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedInputStream.html">BufferedInputStream</a> or a
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html">BufferedReader</a>
manually to get read buffering.) That is, each read operation reads at least
8KB of data (or configurable) from the kernel, and subsequent read operations
read from the read buffer (i.e. the data already read but not consumed) instead
of asking the kernel again. The purpose of this is to get rid of the system
call latency, and not to reduce the number of disk seeks. Because of the need
for context switching and between-kernel-and-userspace data copies, a system
call latency (delay) occurs whenever the program calls the kernel. Even without
this buffering in the program, the number of disk seeks would be equally small,
because the kernel also does buffering (of at least 4KB), so if there is an
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a>
system call followed by a
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>
system call to read data from elsewhere, and the new location is close enough
to the old location, then the kernel can find and return the data from its
buffers, bypassing the hard disk altogether. (On non-Unix systems the names
of the system calls are different, but exactly the same happens, as viewed
from our high-level perspective.)

</p><p>We don't have to make any code changes to take advantage of this
kernel-level buffering, because the kernel does it for us by default. For
example, the last 12 <code>f.seek(...)</code> calls in <i>bisect_left</i>
operate on the same 4096-byte region (plus the length of the last line),
which spans over one or two 4KB blocks on disk, and since these blocks have
been read recently (right in the same <i>bisect_left</i> invocation), the
kernel returns it from its buffer. Thus the last 11 <code>f.seek(...)</code>
calls and their corresponding <code>f.readline()</code> calls don't need a
disk seek or a disk read (unless the last line of the block is very long),
and thus they will be very fast. Again, we didn't have to make any effort in
our code to get this speed benefit.

</p><p>There is another benefit though for which we have to improve our code.
This is getting rid of the system call latency. If the data is in the kernel
buffers already (or it is being read read from a fast SSD with at least
50000 read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOPS">IOPS</a> (IO
operations per second)), then the bottleneck is system call overhead. (In
interpreted programming languages such as Python there can also be a CPU
bottleneck because of the slow interpreter. We should also optimize for code
length because of that.)

</p><p>So our goal now is to reduce the number of system calls. In Python,
<code>f.tell()</code> doesn't generate a system call (except for the very
first time it's called on <code>f</code>), so we have to reduce the number of
times <code>f.readline()</code> and <code>f.seek(...)</code> is called. There
is a simple first step on that road: before each <code>f.seek(...)</code>,
call <code>f.tell()</code> to figure out where we are, and omit the seek call
if we happen to be at the right position already.

</p><p>The implementation of this optimization is straightforward, it just adds
two <code>if</code>s to <code>_read_and_compare</code>:

<p>A generic idea to reduce the number of system calls is to add a cache to
the program, and fetch results from the cache instead of the kernel whenever
possible. Binary search usually doesn't benefit from caching, because it never
needs the same piece of data again, but our implementation does: as soon as
the remaining input is very short (just a few lines), it's reading the same
lines over and over again, with the same <i>midf</i>, but with a different
<i>mid</i>. To further illustrate this, let's imagine an input file which
contains a 64-byte line, and the caller is looking for
a line larger than that. Since it's a binary search and 2<sup>6</sup> = 64,
<i>bisect_left</i> will need 6 (or one more) attempts to find it. Each time
it will use a different <i>mid</i>, but the same <i>midf</i> = 64. Remember
that <i>midf</i> is the offset we get after reading and ignoring a partial
line after the offset <i>mid</i>.

</p><p>To get rid of these last few <code>f.readline()</code> calls, we could
add a cache that maps <i>midf</i> values to their corresponding line
strings. In the example, the entry (<i>midf</i> = 64, <i>line</i> = EOF)
would be added to the cache, and then it would be used for the rest of the
calls, thus eliminating 6 <code>f.readline()</code> calls. (If the caller
was looking for the empty string, this cache wouldn't help him.) In fact, we
don't have to record the whole line in the cache, it's enough to remember
the compare result (<i>g</i>), i.e. if it was smaller than <i>x</i>, the
line the caller is looker for. That's because the binary search does only
such comparisons with the file lines, it doesn't use them for anything else.

</p><p>So this cache can get rid of some of the 2nd <code>f.readline()</code> calls
in <code>_read_and_compare</code>. But what about the 1st calls, i.e. those
which figure out <i>midf</i> from <i>mid</i>?
In the <code>_read_and_compare</code> implementation, <i>fofs</i>
corresponds to <i>midf</i> and <i>ofs</i> corresponds to <i>mid</i>, so
let's use this naming. Luckily, we can eliminate some the 1st calls by caching
<i>ofs</i> in addition to <i>fofs</i>. Let's suppose we have an entry
(<i>ofs</i> = 42, <i>fofs</i> = 55, <i>g</i> = False) in the cache, and
<code>_read_and_compare(ofs=48)</code> is called. We can use the cached result
in this cache entry, because  the cache entry describes a
a line whose end is at offset 55, and offset 42 is somewhere in the middle in
the line. Since 42 â¤ 48 â¤ 55, this implies that offset 48 is also
somewhere in the middle of the same line, so we can use the cached result,
<i>g</i> = False. The value of <i>g</i> is not essential here, it would work
the same way with <i>g</i> = True.

</p><p>Here is an implementation for such a cache (don't worry if you don't get it
for the first reading, it will be explained afterwards):

<p>Fortunately, we could make this improvement without changing any other
functions. This was not a coincidence, an oracle was guiding our code and
interface design. (Another popular explanation is that the real final code was
written earlier than the code evolution steps in this article.)

</p><p>Even without understanding the full logic of the implementation above, we
can easily observe that the size of the cache never increases above 2 entries.
(Just before it is about to increase, we remove an entry.)

</p><p>Another observation (albeit a less obvious one), that this is an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used">LRU
cache</a>, i.e. it discards the least recently used entry on overflow. Thus
it keeps the 2 most recently used entries. The <code>cache.reverse()</code>
calls keep the cache in usage order: whenever we use entry 0, we call
<code>cache.reverse()</code> to swap it with entry 1. (If there is no other
entry besides entry 0, <code>cache.reverse()</code> has no effect. How lucky.)
<code>del cache[0]</code> is used for removal, which removes the LRU entry,
and <code>cache.append(...)</code> is used for adding, which appends to the
end, making the newly added entry the most recently used.

</p><p>Having understood these properties, the other aspects of the
implementation is easy to follow. First we try to fetch from the cache by
<i>ofs</i>. If that fails, we call <code>f.readline()</code> to compute the
<i>fofs</i>. Then if we match the cache entry by <i>fops</i>, and we try to
decrease the <i>ofs</i> of an existing cache entry. If there was no match by
<i>fops</i>, we read the line, compare it, and add the result as a new cache
entry.

</p><p>One question remains: wouldn't we benefit from more than 2 cache entries?
If we limited the cache size to 3 or 4 instead, code execution speed
wouldn't degrade much, and we could potentially get rid of more
<code>f.readline()</code> and <code>f.seek()</code> calls. The obvious
disadvantage is a small increase in complexity. Most of the time we don't
need more than 2 entries, because the binary search operates on lines far
from each other. Except, of course, near the end, when it has already hit
the correct line, but not at the beginning. In that case 2 cache entries
(one for the good line and one for the next or previous line, from which
we're trying to distinguish it) are enough. Even with very short (less than
8 bytes) lines, 13% of the cases the cache eliminated all 3 calls, and in an
additional 20% of the cases only the 2nd <code>f.readline()</code> call was
eliminated. Measuring and explaining the additional, potentially small,
speed benefits of cache sizes 3 and 4 is left as an exercise to you.

</p><h3>Implementation and perfomance notes for the C code</h3>

<p>In addition to the
<a href="https://github.com/pts/pts-line-bisect/blob/master/pts_line_bisect.py">Python
code</a>, this text file binary search algorithm has been
<a href="https://github.com/pts/pts-line-bisect/blob/master/pts_lbsearch.c">implemented
in C</a> as well. The C implementation mostly a direct transliteration of the
Python one, for additional reductions in CPU and memory usage, and increased
portability for memory-constrained systems (such as Linux-based routers) where
a Python interpreter is too heavy-weight. It is also a preferred benchmark
subject: if
anyone claims to have written a faster text file binary search implementation,
its speed should be compared to this C implementation's.

</p><p>Differences in the C and Python implementations:

</p><ul>

<li>The C implementation is much faster, because avoids lseek(2) and read(2)
calls as much as possible, while the Python implementation doesn't,
because in Python the <i>file</i> object discards the read buffer after each
<i>file.seek</i>. The C implementation solves this problem by adding its own
layer of buffering above lseek(2) and read(2), thus bypassing the
buffering and overhead in the <i>FILE *</i> functions defined in
&lt;stdio.h&gt;. With the custom buffering code, it's even possible (but a bit
clumsy) to read the file backwards: an lseek(2) and read(2) will happen only
after each block of 8KB. This works because a buffered seek operation is a
noop if it's within the read buffer. Python <i>file</i> and some
&lt;stdio.h&gt; impelementations (such as glibc-2.11) always do an lseek
system calls (or
<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/_llseek.2.html">_llseek(2)</a>,
its 64-bit equivalent), even when doing relative seeks of 0. (They don't
discard the read buffer though.)

</li><li>The C implementation supports prefix search. To emulate prefix search of
lines starting with <code>bar</code> and <code>foo</code>, and everything
in between, one can call <code>bisect_interval(f, "bar", "foo~")</code>, where
<code>~</code> is a byte with a character code larger than any other bytes in
the file. If there is no such byte (because the file contains all possible
bytes), the string comparison can be special-cased to return true the end of
<i>x</i>. The C implementation does this.

</li><li>The Python implementation is more compact, contains more comments, and it
is easier to understand (especially after reading this article),
reuse as a library and extend.

</li><li>The C implementation has a more versatile command-line interface. The
Python implementation supports only a subset of the command-line flags.

</li><li>The Python implementation has lots of unit tests, the C implementation
doesn't have any.

</li><li>The C equivalent of <i>bisect_interval</i> does a <i>bisect_left</i> for
the lower key, and then a <i>bisect_right</i> for the higher key in the rest
of the file. (The Python implementation is doing it the other way round, for
convenience.) This is faster if the result interval is a short range near
the end of the file, such as recent log entries.

</li><li>The C implementation has a very small memory footprint: only dozens of
offsets and flags in addition to a single file read buffer (of 8KB by
default). It's suprising that the lines themselves don't have to be stored in
memory: they can be read on the fly (from the read buffer) by the comparison,
and â as in Python â only the compare result is cached and used.
Such a memory optimization is not possible in Python (without further
slowdowns), because there is no iterator equivalent of
<code>f.readline()</code>.

</li><li>The C implementation doesn't do any dynamic memory allocation (except
possibly by the printfs generating messages), it's so lightweight and so
low-overhead that it can be used in memory-constrained environments such
as Linux-based routers.

</li></ul>

<p>Of course, both implementations support long files (i.e. files longer than
2GB, whose size gets larger than 31 bits) if the underlying operating system
and filesystem supports it. Python <i>file</i> objects support these long
files by default, and for C <i>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS</i> is #defined to 64, and
this is respected by Linux glibc (and possibly other systems as well).

</p><h3>Future work</h3>

<p>You can name it your work or somebody else's work, at your discretion.

</p><ul>

<li>Run benchmarks on various implementations (including <i>bsearch</i>)
with various parameters. Adjust the read buffer size. Compare with B-tree
databases of key-value stores.

</li><li>Increase the cache entry count from to 2 to 3 or 4, and measure the
speed difference. Hopefully there is none.

</li><li>Do a more thorough research on similar software. Compare features and
benchmark.

</li><li>Add sparse index generation similar to the
<a href="http://leveldb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/table_format.txt">LevelDB
version of Google SSTable</a>. Add index usage for searching.

</li><li>Make sparse index generation incremental and thus very fast if only
a few lines were appended since the last index generation. Let searching use
the sparse index for the vast indexed part of the data, and revert to binary
search for the most recent unindexed data.

</li><li>Add a second-level of sparse index for very long files.

</li><li>Come up with a smarter read buffering and in-memory caching. Is there an
idea yielding significant disk seek count improvements?

</li></ul>
