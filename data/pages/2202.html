					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>Just one week after the PyCharm 4 release, we are eager to announce that the <strong>PyCharm 4.0.1 bug-fix update</strong> has been uploaded and is now <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">available from the download page</a>. It also will be available shortly as a <em>patch update from within the IDEÂ (from PyCharm 4.0 and 4.0.1 RC only)</em>.</p>
<p>As a recap, some notable highlights of this release include: a fix for a rare but severe bug that causes an infinite indexing, a fix for a settings import bug, code completion and inspections fixes, a fix for matplotlib support, a fix for remote interpreters support and some Django support fixes.</p>
