      <p>Added ‘ref’ property to all watchers. Settings it to False make watcher call ev_unref/ev_ref appropriately so that this watcher does not prevent loop.run()/hub.join()/run() from exiting.
Made resolver_ares.Resolver use ‘ref’ property for internal watcher.</p>
<p>In all servers, method “kill” was renamed to “close”. The old name is available as <span class="changelog-highlight-dep">deprecated</span> alias.</p>
<p>Added a few properties to the loop: backend_fd, fdchangecnt, timercnt.</p>
<p>Upgraded c-ares to 1.7.5+patch.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> getaddrinfo to return results in the order (::1, IPv4, IPv6).</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> getaddrinfo() to handle integer of string type. Thanks to kconor.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> gethostbyname() to handle ‘’ (empty string).</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> getaddrinfo() to convert UnicodeEncodeError into error(‘Int or String expected’).</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> getaddrinfo() to uses the lowest 16 bits of passed port integer similar to built-in _socket.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> getnameinfo() to call getaddrinfo() to process arguments similar to built-in _socket.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> gethostbyaddr() to use getaddrinfo() to process arguments.</p>
<p>version_info is now a 5-tuple.</p>
<p>Added handle_system_error() method to Hub (used internally).</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> Hub’s run() method to never exit. This prevent inappropriate switches into parent greenlet.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> Hub.join() to return True if Hub was already dead.</p>
<p>Added ‘event’ argument to Hub.join().</p>
<p>Added <cite>run()</cite> function to gevent top level package.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> Greenlet.start() to exit silently if greenlet was already started rather than raising <code><span>AssertionError</span></code>.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> Greenlet.start() not to schedule another switch if greenlet is already dead.</p>
<p><span class="changelog-highlight-fix">Fixed</span> gevent.signal() to spawn Greenlet instead of raw greenlet. Also it’ll switch into the new greenlet immediately instead of scheduling additional callback.</p>
<p>Do monkey patch create_connection() as gevent’s version works better with gevent.socket.socket than the standard create_connection.</p>
<p>pywsgi: make sure we don’t try to read more requests if socket operation failed with EPIPE</p>
<p>pywsgi: if we failed to send the reply, change ‘status’ to socket error so that the logs mention the error.</p>
