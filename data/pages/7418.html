<p>This month we are joining forces with the Ruby Meetup group to present 2 great talks:</p>
<p>1) Kubernetes</p>
<p>2) Teaching Python to kids using Raspberry Pi's <br/></p>
<p>Here's more about the latter: <br/></p>
<p>Ryan Ritz is a high school Computer Science teacher at Park Tudor who has been teaching computer science for 17 years. On November 10th, Ritz will provide insights on how to help kids get started with Python and Raspberry Pi's. He will share educational resources, project ideas and pedagogical tips with the IndyPy community.  <br/>  <br/>Ryan Ritz holds a B.A. degree in computer science from DePauw University, where he was the recipient of the Wylie-Condict Computer Science Scholarship and was inducted into Alpha Lambda Delta, Phi Eta Sigma and Mortar Board honor societies. Ritz has worked as a software engineer for Andersen Consulting and DePauw University, as a computer science research assistant at DePauw, and as a computer coordinator assistant the Hasten Hebrew Academy of Indianapolis.  <br/></p> 
<p>Hope to see you for beers and Python! We may also have a few Python books to give out from our sponsors O'Reilly and Pearson...</p> 
<p>Be sure to RSVP!  <br/></p>
