<p>in-depth comparison of files, archives, and directories</p>








<p>diffoscope will try to get to the bottom of what makes files or
directories different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds
and transform various binary formats into more human readable form to
compare them. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just as
easily.</p>
<p>It can be scripted through error codes, and a report can be produced
with the detected differences. The report can be text or HTML.
When no type of report has been selected, diffoscope defaults
to write a text report on the standard output.</p>
<p>diffoscope is developed as part of the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds" rel="nofollow">“reproducible builds” Debian
project</a>.
It is meant to be able to quickly understand why two builds of the same
package produce different outputs. diffoscope was previously named
debbindiff.</p>
<div id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>To compare two files in-depth and produce an HTML report, run something like:</p>
<pre>$ bin/diffoscope --html output.html build1.changes build2.changes
</pre>
<p>diffoscope will exit with 0 if there’s no differences and 1 if there
are.</p>
<p><em>diffoscope</em> can also compare non-existent files:</p>
<pre>$ bin/diffoscope /nonexistent archive.zip
</pre>
<p>To get all possible options, run:</p>
<pre>$ bin/diffoscope --help
</pre>

<h2>External dependencies</h2>
<p>diffoscope requires Python 3 and the following modules available on PyPI:
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libarchive-c" rel="nofollow">libarchive-c</a>,
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic" rel="nofollow">python-magic</a>.</p>
<p>Optionally, the following modules will enhance it:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>tlsh</tt> is used to recognize file renames.
It is build from <a href="https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh" rel="nofollow">tlsh source</a>.
Available on Debian as <tt><span class="pre">python3-tlsh</span></tt>.</li>
<li><tt><span class="pre">python-debian</span></tt> is used to inspect Debian control files.
It is available on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-debian" rel="nofollow">PyPI</a>.</li>
<li><tt><span class="pre">rpm-python</span></tt> is used to inspect RPM files.
It is built from <a href="http://rpm.org/" rel="nofollow">rpm</a>.
Available on Debian and Fedora as <tt><span class="pre">python3-rpm</span></tt>.</li>
<li><tt><span class="pre">Magic-file-extension</span></tt> can be used instead of
<tt><span class="pre">python-magic</span></tt>. It is built from <a href="http://www.darwinsys.com/file/" rel="nofollow">file</a>.
Available on Debian and Fedora as <tt><span class="pre">python3-magic</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The various comparators rely on external commands being available. To
get a list of them, please run:</p>
<pre>$ bin/diffoscope --list-tools
