<p>Here's the algorithm that inspired it all! We use a custom fetch_eventvestor method that will get you a static set of data from 2007 up till January, 2015.</p>

<p>There are a number of different parameters that you can change in order to fiddle around with the algorithm:</p>

<p>context.days_to_hold_positions - The number of days to enter into a position before exiting<br/>
context.hedge_lookback - The number of days to look back before calculating our beta hedge (SPY)<br/>
In choose strategy, you have a number of different lines that you can comment/uncomment to turn on the different parts of the strategy found in the notebook.<br/>
Notes:</p>

<p><strong>The sample data in this algorithm provides a static snapshot between January 2007 - January 2015. That being said, fetch_eventvestor is not allowed in Live Trading and your algorithm will throw an error if you try to deploy it in either paper, context, or live trading modes!</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are working to incorporate this data in a more permanent fashion but until then, <a href="http://bit.ly/1zGbhXM">you can contact EventVestor for more information.</a></strong></p>

<p>This particular algorithm was created by @Richard Prokopyshen who found an error in the hedging logic of my first algorithm. Thanks for the share Richard! </p>
