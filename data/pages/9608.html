<h2>DSF grant programme for DjangoCon Europe 2016</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Daniele Procida &amp; Baptiste Mispelon</strong> on January 21, 2016 </span>

<p>The Django Software Foundation has made 5000€ available for attendees of <a class="reference external" href="http://2016.djangocon.eu">DjangoCon Europe 2016</a>, to help meet the costs of attending.</p>
<p>The DjangoCon Europe organisers have also made a number of free tickets available which will be allocated to applicants, along with grants, by a committee.</p>
<p>This year, the DjangoCon Europe committee has <em>also</em> committed a further 5000€ in financial aid, meaning that there will be a total 10000€ available to attendees who need financial assistance - the largest amount ever at a Django conference in Europe.</p>

<h3>Who should apply for funding?</h3>
<p>If you'd like to go to DjangoCon Europe but need some funding to make that possible, then <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>You don't need to be a well-known speaker to qualify for funding. In fact you don't need to be a speaker at all.</p>
<p>You don't need to be a Django expert, or a mover and shaker in the Django community. You don't need to have authored a key library, solved an important problem or made a notable achievement.</p>
<p>You just have to want to go to DjangoCon. Programming beginners and newcomers to the community are just as welcome; in fact, it's a stated aim of the conference to bring in new people to the event.</p>
<p>We will be glad to receive your application.</p>

<p>The application process will close on January 26th and awards will be made by February 1st.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome to apply for funding, but please be aware that there are always applications for more funds than are available, so sadly not everyone's requests for funding can be met.</p>
