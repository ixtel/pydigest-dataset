          <p>Thank you for the contrasting data points. I'll keep them in mind in the future.</p>

<p>However, to clarify, I was very careful to say that it was every spell-checker that I personally have used. The last Macintosh I ever used was a Mac SE running System 7 when I was a very young child and, at that age, I had no interest in writing.</p>

<p>The underlying point I'd intended to convey was that the un-accented forms are perfectly valid English (though, as you've now pointed out, not the preferred forms according to various style guides). </p>

<p>Also, please take note that I'm speaking from a viewpoint that, given their rarity in day-to-day common usage (likely, due to a lack of easy ways to type combining diacritics when using Windows with a US ASCII layout), the accented forms will probably go away eventually because, based on the following evidence, common usage tends to drag formal usage along, kicking and screaming:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not even formal English uses the words ye, thou, thee, thy, or thine anymore.</li>
<li>...nor does it use "mine" in place of "my" before a word that begins with a vowel, despite still using "an" in place of "a" under the same conditions.</li>
<li>The misuse of the word "tragedy" to mean something other than "a literary work in which the hero can't escape their downfall" is so widely accepted that it's not uncommon for an individual to be unaware of the existence of the original meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>(I don't like that "to whom" seems to be dying out in common speech, given that "to who" feels like "a apple", but I can see the rationale. It's extra complexity that appears to impart no additional expressiveness to the language relative to what is inferred from context... just like the distinction between "ye" and "you" or the "-th" conjugation for verbs used with a 3rd-person singular pronoun.)</p>
