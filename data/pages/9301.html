                    <p>Today I want to talk about lists. Not for shopping, not the programming data type, but the display of items in both unordered and ordered fashion.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.pydanny.com/markup-language-faceoff-lists.html"><img alt="Bullets faceoff" class="align-center" id="bullets-faceoff" src="http://pydanny.com/static/bullets.png"/></a>
<p>Specifically this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Item A</li>
<li>Item B<ol class="arabic">
<li>First Numbered Inner Item</li>
<li>Second Numbered Inner Item</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Item C</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, lists of bullets and numbers. This article explores some of the different tools used by the programming world to render display lists, specifically <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>reStructuredText</strong>, <strong>Markdown</strong>, and <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="html">
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>If you view the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> source of this web page, you'll find this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"simple"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Item A<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Item B<span class="nt">&lt;ol</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"arabic"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>First Numbered Inner Item<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Second Numbered Inner Item<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Item C<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Or more clearly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"simple"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Item A<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Item B
        <span class="nt">&lt;ol</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"arabic"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>First Numbered Inner Item<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Second Numbered Inner Item<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>Item C<span class="nt">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This works, but is incredibly verbose. <strong>HTML</strong> requires closing tags on every element (keep in mind browsers are not the same as specifications). Working with lists in HTML becomes tedious quickly. Which is why so many people use <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> tools or mark up languages like <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong>, as it expedites creation of lists (and many other things).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restructuredtext">
<h2>reStructuredText</h2>
<p>This blog is written in <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a> and transformed into <strong>HTML</strong>. Let's see the markup for this blog post:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="m">*</span> Item A
<span class="m">*</span> Item B

  <span class="m">#.</span> First Numbered Inner Item
  <span class="m">#.</span> Second Numbered Inner Item

<span class="m">*</span> Item C
</pre></div>
<p>Notice the extra lines between bullets and numbers? A behavior of <strong>reStructuredText</strong> is that you have to put those in nested lists in order to make things display correctly. Also, 2 spaces indentation generates a different result than 4 spaces, the former creating sub-bullets, the latter creating an indented block quote with bullets. They are there to remove ambiguity.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I did not know this until the day after I wrote this article. Since understanding these behaviors can be challenging, myself and Eric Holscher of <a class="reference external" href="ttp://readthedocs.org">ReadTheDocs</a> fame began a project last year to <a class="reference external" href="http://restructuredtext.readthedocs.org/">clearly index and document</a> all the details of <strong>reStructuredText</strong> from the user's point of view. Our plan was to provide this as an adjunct to the <a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/">formal documentation</a> of <strong>reStructuredText</strong>. Alas, time and work considerations got in the way. If you want to help expand our effort, you can contribute at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydanny/restructuredtext">https://github.com/pydanny/restructuredtext</a>.</p>
<p>One thing to note about <strong>reStructuredText</strong> is that it's pretty much Python only. Outside the Python world if you are writing plaintext markup then odds are you are using <strong>Markdown</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="markdown">
<h2>Markdown</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> does lists really well. Terse and no weird quirks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="m">*</span> Item A
<span class="m">*</span> Item B
    <span class="m">1.</span> First Numbered Inner Item
    <span class="m">1.</span> Second Numbered Inner Item
<span class="m">*</span> Item C
</pre></div>
<p>Another nice feature about <strong>Markdown</strong> is that it's in use everywhere. GitHub, Stack Overflow, my favorite tablet writing app, and a lot more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="markdown-vs-restructuredtext">
<h2>Markdown vs. reStructuredText</h2>
<p>Why don't I switch from <strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>Markdown</strong>? Here are my reasons against switching:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Force of habit.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> requires it to display package long descriptions nicely on Package pages.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)">Sphinx</a> is based on it.</li>
<li><strong>reStructuredText</strong> has one concrete standard, with extensions that people add. Markdown has many standards, which may or may not have shared features.</li>
<li>I can use <a class="reference external" href="http://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> to help transform <strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>Markdown</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="latex">
<h2>LaTeX</h2>
<p>Finally, let's discuss <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>. While not a markup language it bears mentioning, and I'll explain why later in this section.</p>
<p>Up to about 8-10 years ago <strong>LaTeX</strong> was used in a lot of technical writing, including the Python core documentation. That ended with the rise of mark up languages, relegating <strong>LaTeX</strong> to the world of academics, mathematicians and computer scientists - anywhere complex equations need to be specified.</p>
<p>LaTeX belongs in this article because it is so commonly used with markup. In fact, as far as I can tell, in order to render <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> content into the PDF format, the most common approach is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Use a script to transform the markup into <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</li>
<li>Use a tool like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX">XeTeX</a> to render the <strong>LaTeX</strong> into PDF.</li>
</ol>
<p>Why the extra step? Why not just go directly from markup to PDF? Well, the content in <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> have to be formatted in order for them to be displayed, or they will just look like plaintext markup. When they are converted to <strong>HTML</strong>, the browser does the formatting for us. When they are translated to PDF, LaTeX is a very common choice. That is because <strong>LaTeX</strong> isn't a markup language, but a typesetting tool. Unlike <strong>reStructuredText</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> which are designed for ease of use, <strong>LaTeX</strong> is designed to make documents look good.</p>
<p>Here is how I define my sample list in <strong>LaTeX</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">\begin</span><span class="nb">{</span>itemize<span class="nb">}</span>
    <span class="k">\item</span> Item A
    <span class="k">\item</span> Item A
        <span class="k">\begin</span><span class="nb">{</span>enumerate<span class="nb">}</span>
            <span class="k">\item</span> First Numbered Inner Item
            <span class="k">\item</span> Second Numbered Inner Item
        <span class="k">\end</span><span class="nb">{</span>enumerate<span class="nb">}</span>
    <span class="k">\item</span> Item C
<span class="k">\end</span><span class="nb">{</span>itemize<span class="nb">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Halfway between the markup languages and HTML in verbosity, <strong>LaTeX</strong> lists are of medium difficulty to write. If this example makes <strong>LaTeX</strong> look easy, please realize that while lists are easy to understand, other structures like <strong>LaTeX</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables">tables</a> can quickly get out of hand. <strong>LaTeX</strong>'s reputation for being an arcane tool is a well deserved one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modifying-generated-latex">
<h2>Modifying Generated LaTeX</h2>
<p>Several book authors, including ourselves, have written books using <strong>reStructuredText</strong> or <strong>Markdown</strong>, generated the <strong>LaTeX</strong>, then modified the <strong>LaTeX</strong> before rendering the PDF. The approach is seductive: You get the ease of a markup language combined with the formatting precision of <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>
<p>Or do you?</p>
<p>The problem my wife and I have faced is that the combination of <strong>LaTeX</strong> packages and tools we've assembled for ourselves to write books like <a class="reference external" href="http://twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8">Two Scoops of Django</a> is very, very different than what is rendered via <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils">docutils</a>' <tt class="docutils literal">rst2latex</tt> or Sphinx <tt class="docutils literal">make latex</tt>. We've tried to write migration scripts, but have found that we end up spending too much of our time on formatting. That's why we have stuck with hand-crafted artisan <strong>LaTeX</strong>.</p>
<p>That isn't to say it isn't possible. In fact, Matt Harrison has <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Brief-Introduction-Python-Testing-Harrison-ebook/dp/B00AY4VE8E/?tag=mlinar-20">released</a> a number <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Learning-Iteration-Generators-Python/dp/1492333514/ref=sr_1_7?tag=mlinar-20">handsome</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Treading-Python-1-Foundations/dp/1475266413/ref=sr_1_2?tag=mlinar-20">Python</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Treading-Python-2-Intermediate/dp/149055095X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20">books</a> following this path (<strong>reStructuredText</strong> to <strong>LaTeX</strong>). I'm certain there are <strong>Markdown</strong> books that follow this path too.</p>

<div class="section" id="closing-thoughts">
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>For better or for worse, lists of bullets and numbers are a foundation of how we communicate via the written medium. They allow for terse communication of ideas and thought, but that same terseness can mean we skip over details. Interestingly enough, the very tools that we use to create lists can color our ability and desire to use them.</p>
