                    <p>Since the first <a class="reference external" href="http://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a> event I've watched the movement grow with a sense of of awe and inevitability. There is something about it that is both contagious and powerful, and in a very good way. This past weekend I had my first chance to attend one of their events in Ensenada, Mexico.</p>
<p>This is what we saw. A room full of attendees with laser focus. The coaches were clearly inspired by the dedication of the women who had come to learn and grow.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, the energy hadn't dwindled, it had accelerated.</p>

<p>No one wanted the day to end.</p>

<p>We did our small part. We coached and did our best to give an invited inspirational talk.</p>
 <p>The Django Girls Ensenada organizers did a magnificent job of assembling a wonderful day that touched lives. We were very impressed!</p>
<p>The event had two sponsors, <a class="reference external" href="http://halaken.org">Hala Ken</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://tijuana.usconsulate.gov/">US Consulate in Tijuana, Mexico</a>. They did more than just sponsor, they were part of the effort of organizing and running the event.</p>
<p>My co-author, co-presenter, co-everything wife AudreyR also blogged her account of it: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codemakesmehappy.com/2015/05/our-trip-to-djangogirls-ensenada-mexico.html">Our Trip to DjangoGirls Ensenada, Mexico</a>.</p>
