        <h2>MicroPython</h2>

        <p>
        MicroPython is a lean and fast implementation of the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python 3</a> programming language
        that is optimised to run on a microcontroller.  The MicroPython board is a small electronic circuit board that runs
        MicroPython on the bare metal, and gives you a low-level Python operating system that can be used to control all kinds
        of electronic projects.
        </p>

        <p>
        MicroPython was successfully funded via a Kickstarter campaign.  The software is available to the
        public under the MIT open source license.
        </p>

        <p>
        Further information about the project can be found at the Kickstarter pages:
