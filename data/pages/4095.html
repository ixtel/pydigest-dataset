The <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/events/langsummit/">Python Language
Summit</a> is an annual event that is held in conjunction with the North
American edition of <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/">PyCon</a>.  Its
mission is to bring together core developers of various Python
implementations to discuss topics of interest within that group.  The 2015
meeting was held April 8 in Montréal, Canada.  I was happy to be invited to attend
the summit so that I could bring readers a report on the discussions there.

The summit was deemed the "Barry and Larry show" by some, since it was
co-chaired by Barry Warsaw and Larry Hastings (seen at right in their
stylish fezzes).  Somewhere around 50
developers sat in on the talks, which focused on a number of interesting
topics, including atomicity guarantees for Python operations, possible
plans to make Python 3 more attractive to developers, infrastructure
changes for development, better measurement for Python 3 adoption, the
<tt>/usr/bin/python</tt> symbolic link, type hints, and more.
