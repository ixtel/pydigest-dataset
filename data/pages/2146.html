<p/><a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a><p> is a </p><b>video download tool</b><p> written in </p><b>Python</b><p>.
</p><p>
I had blogged about youtube-dl a while ago, here:

</p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.in/2013/03/youtube-dl-yourube-downloader-in-python.html">youtube-dl, a YouTube downloader in Python</a><p> [1]
</p><p>
and again some days later, here:

</p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.in/2013/04/how-to-download-pycon-us-2013-videos.html">How to download PyCon US 2013 videos for offline viewing using youtube-dl</a>
<p>
(The comments on the above post give some better / easier ways to download the videos than I gave in the post.)
</p><p>
Today I saw that a </p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a><p> thread about youtube-dl was </p><b>on the front page of Hacker News</b><p> for at least part of the day (up to the time of writing this). The thread is here:

</p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8647943">youtube-dl (on Hacker News)</a>
<p>
I scanned the thread and saw many comments saying that the tool is good, what different users are using it for, many advanced tips on how to use it, etc. The </p><b>original creator</b><p> of </p><b>youtube-dl, Ricardo Garcia</b><p>, as well as a </p><b>top contributor</b><p> and the </p><b>current maintainer</b><p> (</p><b>Filippo Valsorda</b><p> and </p><b>Philipp Hagemeister</b><p>, respectively) also participated in the HN thread, as </p><b>HN users rg3, FiloSottile and phihag_</b><p>, respectively. I got to know from the thread that youtube-dl has many contributors, and that its source code is updated quite frequently (for changes in video site formats and other issues), both points which I did not know earlier. (I did know that you can use it to update itself, using the </p><b>-U option</b><p>). 
</p><p>
Overall, the HN thread is a worthwhile read, IMO, for people interested in downloading videos for offline viewing. The thread had over 130 comments at the time of writing this post.
</p><p>
(On a personal note, since I first got to know about youtube-dl and downloaded it, I've been using it a fair amount to download videos every now and then, for offline viewing, and it has worked pretty well. There were only a few times when it gave an error saying the video could not be downloaded, and I am not sure whether it was due to a problem with the tool, or with the video site.)

[1] My </p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.in/2013/03/youtube-dl-yourube-downloader-in-python.html">first post about youtube-dl</a><p> also had a brief overview of its code, which may be of interest to some Pythonistas.
</p><p>
This other post which mentions youtube-dl may also be of interest:

</p><a href="http://jugad2.blogspot.in/2013/08/the-most-watched-python-repositories-on.html">The most-watched Python repositories on Github</a>
<p>
since youtube-dl was one of those most-watched repositories, at the time of writing that post.
