<p>                        You’ve learned Python the hard way. You flew through Codecademy. Now you feel unchallenged, and your interest in programming is waning. Where are the courses for those looking to excel past the beginner level? To the developing Pythonistas, here are some intermediate courses to help get you to the next level.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32548" src="http://cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image00.jpg" alt="Python: The Next Level"/>This course is comprised of four units. Each unit is a self-contained problem set of increasing difficulty. Students work along with the instructor to develop algorithms to solve each of the problems. Units are broken into short lessons making it convenient for busy students to pick up where they left off. The curriculum includes lambda functions, recursion, generator functions, generator expressions, try except blocks, test writing, and much more. Students who complete the course will gain an understanding of algorithm design and how to write scripts more efficiently.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-32549 size-full" src="http://cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image01.jpg" alt="Web Development How To Build a Blog"/>This Udacity course walks students through using Python to build a web application. It also introduces the fundamentals of web development. Each unit represents a building block necessary to complete the final project of the course. The course begins with an introduction to  core web development structure with HTML and HTTP requests. Students then learn to launch an app using Google App Engine. Later lessons cover database techniques, authentication, APIs and caching. Students learn to connect all the pieces using python through a series of assignments and coding challenges. The course provides an excellent example of how developers must use multiple technologies to complete a project.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32552" src="http://cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image04.jpg" alt="Python Beyond The Basics"/>This course is the companion of Pluralsight’s Python Fundamentals course. It is designed to help students advance past an introductory level. Students will use python to create applications of varying scale. Lessons illustrate techniques for writing productive and high quality code. The course is made up of over seven hours of videos that cover introspection, context managers, implementing collections, subtype polymorphism and more. Pluralsight has several other intermediate level courses that cover unit testing, game creation with PyGame, Flask, home automation, Raspberry Pi and other advanced Python programming topics.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-32550 size-full" src="http://cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image02.jpg" alt="Intermediate Python Practical Techniques"/>This course is part of O’Reily’s Python learning path. Coursework is done in ipython notebook. The curriculum aims at broadening a student’s Python capabilities. It covers advanced tasks like unit testing, web scraping and scientific computing. Students will learn about comprehensions, generators, generator expressions, how to use unicode in python, how to use regex for text analysis, database API, as well as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries. The instructor also discusses common obstacles python programmers experience and how to overcome them.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-32551 size-full" src="http://cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image03.jpg" alt="NumPy"/>One route towards a deeper understanding of Python programming is discovering and mastering different add-on packages. NumPy is an extension for python used for numeric computation. It provides users with advanced tools for analyzing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. NumPy has applications in data science, natural sciences, and financial analysis. This course is comprised of five hours of video lectures, and 13 exercises. Though this course is primarily an introduction to NumPy it also offers insight into many advanced topics like memory layout, structure arrays, memory maps, and how to enhance performance and efficiency.  Enthought also has intermediate to advance course in SciPy, advanced Python, and interfacing with other languages.</p>
<h2><b>Create Your Own Projects</b></h2>
<p>These courses are all designed for students who have completed at least one preliminary Python course. Remember, becoming an adept programmer also means being able to apply programing techniques to solve problems and develop personal projects. Try to take what you learn in these courses to push a project of your own creation to GitHub. Get some feedback, iterate, and continue developing to gain more confidence using advanced tools and techniques.</p>
