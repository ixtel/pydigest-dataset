<h2>Django 1.7 release candidate 2</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>James Bennett</strong> on July 27, 2014 </span>

<p>It's almost here!</p>
<p>Today we're pleased to announce the second release-candidate package
for Django 1.7. This release has been quite a while in the making, and
includes several major new features. There's a new built-in
schema-migration framework, improved tools for validating and checking
your projects, a complete refactor of the way Django identifies and
loads your applications, and support for custom database lookups.</p>
<p>And that's just the biggest highlights; for a full rundown of
features, see <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.7/">the in-development 1.7 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>As with all pre-release packages, this is <strong>not</strong> for production
use. But if you'd like to take some of the new features for a spin, or
to help find and fix bugs (which should be reported to <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket">the issue
tracker</a>), you can grab a copy of the release-candidate package from
<a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a>. And as always, signed MD5 and SHA1 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.7c2.checksum.txt">checksums</a>
of the 1.7 release-candidate package are available.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-note-regarding-release-keys">
<h4>Note regarding release keys</h4>
<p>For many years, every Django package has been accompanied by signed
checksums, for verification purposes; more recently, starting with the
1.6 release series, <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django">our uploads to the Python Package Index</a> have
been trying out the option to upload signed packages, and signing <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/django/django/tags">our release tags on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Historically only two keys have been used for this signing; James
Bennett's key, ID <tt class="docutils literal">0x3684C0C08C8B2AE1</tt>, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss' key,
ID <tt class="docutils literal">0x69666DFEB00E963E</tt>. James' key is a 1024-bit DSA key, and is
increasingly inappropriate for this type of use.</p>
<p>Moving forward, there will be two changes relevant to
security-conscious users and distributors of Django:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The list of authorized release keys is now formalized, and appears
in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/django-releasers.txt">Django releasers file</a>. Any key listed in that file is
authorized to issue Django releases.</li>
<li>James' old key has been deprecated and will no longer be used to
issue releases; a new 4096-bit key, ID <tt class="docutils literal">0x2D9266A6808FE067</tt>, has been generated and signed by
members of the core team and James' old key, and added to the releasers file. James'
old key should be considered revoked for purposes of signing Django
releases and security notifications. It is expected that in the
not-too-distant future (likely after Django 1.7.1) that old key will also be formally revoked
using a GPG revocation certificate, following a transition period
of a few releases using the new key. This revocation will be
publicly announced when it occurs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Django 1.7 RC 2 is the first release using James' new key.</p>
