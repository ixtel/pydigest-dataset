<p>As Mark Twain (almost) said, the difference between elegant <span class="il">Python</span> and clumsy <span class="il">Python</span> is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.  This talk will show you how to write beautiful and fast code that takes full advantage of <span class="il">Python</span>‘s features.Learn common idioms used by the <span class="il">Python</span> community to write “Pythonic” code, and learn<em>why</em> these idioms are popular.  Learn how to use list comprehensions and generator expressions in combination with <span class="il">Python</span> built-ins to do powerful things in a small amount of code.  Learn how to use generator functions to make your main loop simpler and easier to understand.  Learn the difference between “mutable” and “immutable” data structures, and use the word “mutate” non-ironically.You will get the most out of this talk if you already know the basics of <span class="il">Python</span>, but you are still welcome if you just want to get a taste of the flavor of the language.  Come and see why <span class="il">Python</span> fans are so fanatical!</p>
