				<div class="challengedescription"><div id="challengedescription37"><p>We need a project that we can do together and try on it different popular techniques and methods of python developing.</p>
<p>We need to train on:</p>
<ul>
<li>object-oriented programming</li>
<li>code sharing between applications and team members</li>
<li>different GUI (command line, desktop, web)</li>
<li>client server applications</li>
<li>different frameworks (not just Django etc)</li>
<li>different types of web APIs (REST, SOAP etc)</li>
<li>"good practices" and patterns for web developement (MVC etc)</li>
<li>design patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggest your ideas in a report for this challenge. </p>
<p>It must be some interesting but small task to play around it. We can not buid a big project now.</p></div>

				<div class="challengedescription"><div id="challengedescription38"><p>After you learned basics of the Python programming you can start to code some bigger, more serious applications. And you need to know what is good way to organize the code, manage components etc.</p>
<p>Good way to know this is to learn some good big applications code as an example.</p>
<p>In this challenge, search in web for different Python applications . For example <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonProjects">this directory</a>. And choose one (or more) app to review. Download apps and review the code. Try to understand how an app is organized. How components, modules are used .</p>
<p>In the report for the challenge post what did you learn, what project reviewed.</p></div>

<p>Search the web and find good articles, manuals, documents on best practices of the Python programming.</p>
<p>In a report describe what did you find to share with all other.</p></div>

				<div class="challengedescription"><div id="challengedescription40"><p>We need an example to learn different Python methods and technologies on it.</p>
<p>The good example is the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">"Tic-tac-toe"</a>.</p>
<p>So the next task (challenge) is to create this game with Python.</p>
<p>Requirements are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>User interface doesn't matter, best is to use the command line interface</li>
<li>the game must support 2 modes - "human vs human" and "human vs computer" </li>
</ul>
<p>No any other requirements. Just do the working progmar and publish it in the report.</p>
<p>Use the http://pastebin.com/ service to publish your code, add a link in the report.</p>
<p>In next challenges we will improve our realisations of this game, will do different GUIs , APIs, Client-Server realisations etc.</p>
<p>For now just do the simplest implementation.  </p></div>

				<div class="challengedescription"><div id="challengedescription41"><p>Before we leraned "best practices" and trained to work in a group each of us has own "programming style". Someone forget to check for exceptions, someone has not readable code etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need to review a code from previous challenge posted by other members and analyze it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a report for this challenge write what reports from previous challenge did you check and what interesting did you find in them. What would you correct.  </p></div>

				<div class="challengedescription"><div id="challengedescription42"><p>Next step is to modify our game created with Python to be able to share the logic of the game with other members/projects.</p>
<p>Our initial program , most probably, was created as one py file with using functions. Someone "experienced" could use classes.</p>
<p>Now we all will modify our program with using classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The task.</strong></p>
<p>Modufy your Tic-tac-tou program to split the login and a user interface.</p>
<p>Create 2 classes as separate modules.</p>
<p>One is Tictaktou class. It has  logic of the game. It contains a state of a game, checks for a vinner etc. It doesn't print something. </p>
<p>The second class is PCGamer. It contsins a logic of a computer player. It is used only in a mode "Human vs Computer". This class uses Tictaktou class to do moves.</p>
<p>And the 3-rd (main) script implements a user interface, an interface can be same as before (command line etc) </p></div>
