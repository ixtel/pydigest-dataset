Once upon a time I had an MSX homecomputer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX</a>), and I learned MS-BASIC, Z80 assembly, C and Pascal, so I got an early grounding in different languages and levels of abstraction. I later picked up other languages, my first job involved csh (I think, can't quite remember), then Perl, then added Java, JavaScript, Visual Basic (ick!), and finally Python.

So although I now specialise in Python, I have all that other experience to draw on. Understanding how computers and networking works is a huge boon and means I can adapt to many different tasks; I've done embedded stuff as well as web tech in all layers of the stack.

I don't have specific languages to recommend, other than try to get different abstractions going. Learn *some* assembler, it is humbling. There are PDP-11 emulators if you want to start simple. Pick up C, understand pointers and memory allocation. Pick up some basic OS concepts, network concepts. Mix in some good basic algorithm theory, and your set for whatever tech the future will bring.</p></div></div></body></html>
