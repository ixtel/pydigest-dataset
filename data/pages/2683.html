<span><a href="http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/currency-portfolio-optimization-using-scienceops.html" target="_blank">Currency Portfolio Optimization Using ScienceOps</a></span><br/>
In this post, we'll take the view of someone (e.g. a bank or a mutual fund manager) with a lot of cash to invest in foreign currencies. We want to buy foreign currencies such that we maximize our return with respect to the US Dollar (USD) over the next month. We won't worry about the actual amounts invested. We simply want to maximize the percent return given that we convert 100% of some known amount into foreign currencies.<br/>

More and more information from local, state and federal governments is being placed on the web. However, a lot of the data is not presented in a way that is easy to download and manipulate. I think it is an important civic duty for us all to be aware of how government money is spent. Having the data in a more accessible format is a first step in that process. In this article, we will use BeautifulSoup to scrape some data from the Minnesota 2014 Capital Budget. Then load the data into a pandas DataFrame and create a simple plot showing where the money is going.<br/>

You will learn how the Selenium WebDriver Python API can be integrated with CI and Build tools to allow tests to be run while building applications. This book will guide you through using the Selenium WebDriver Python client library as well as other tools from the Selenium project. Towards the end of this book, you'll get to grips with Selenium Grid, which is used for running tests in parallel using nodes for cross-browser testing. It will also give you a basic overview of the concepts, while helping you improve your practical testing skills with Python and Selenium.<br/>
