<h2>Announcing Django's 2016 fundraising campaign</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Adrienne Lowe</strong> on December 17, 2015 </span>

<p>Today the Django Software Foundation launches our fundraising campaign for 2016.</p>
<p>We aim to raise $200,000 in order to fully fund our Fellow program, continue contributing to Django Girls workshops, sponsor official Django conferences, and more.</p>
<p>Together, we made significant progress in 2015:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Our full-time <a class="reference external" href="/fundraising/#fellowship-program">Django Fellow</a> made Django's contribution process more pleasant by promptly triaging tickets and reviewing patches. For the first time in the 10+ years of Django, we released on time and according to schedule. And we did it twice! Our fellow shepherded the release of Django 1.8 and 1.9 with tender care. Read the full details in Tim's December <a class="reference external" href="/weblog/2015/dec/17/fellowship-2015-retrospective/">retrospective</a>.</li>
<li>We contributed to eighteen <a class="reference external" href="/fundraising/#django-girls">Django Girls</a> workshops around the world, including many first-time workshops in countries where companies don't readily recognize the importance of funding outreach initiatives for women in technology.</li>
<li>By sponsoring DjangoCon Europe and US, we provided funds that were used by organizers to pay travel expenses for talented speakers from low-income backgrounds, who otherwise would have been unable to attend.</li>
</ul>
<p>With your help, we can do so much more. Please visit our <a class="reference external" href="/fundraising/">fundraising page</a> and make a gift today.</p>
<p>Knowing that Django developers are busy people (perfectionists with deadlines?), we added the option to make an automatic recurring gift so you can use your keystrokes contributing a patch to Django instead of entering your card's digits.</p>
<p>Join our leadership-level donors with a gift of $1,000 or more per year and we'll give you a special Django Leader badge you can put on your website or online profile to show off your awesome generosity. Thanks to talented designer <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/andrewjfrancis/">Andrew Francis</a> for making these possible!</p>
<p>Interested in corporate membership? We've revised that program, too, and would love for you to have a look at the <a class="reference external" href="/foundation/corporate-membership/">new benefits</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:fundraising@djangoproject.com">fundraising@djangoproject.com</a>.</p>
