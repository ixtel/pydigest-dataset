<p>A library of code for interacting with Mashery API</p>








<p>A sample project that exists as an aid to the <a href="https://packaging.python.org" rel="nofollow">Python Packaging User Guide</a>’s <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html" rel="nofollow">Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing
Projects</a>.</p>
<p>This projects does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p>This is the README file for the project.</p>
<p>The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It
will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as
the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be written for
that purpose.</p>
<p>Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not
a good idea, although a simple “What’s New” section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.</p>
