At that time, I just started it for
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1450-the-github-data-challenge-ii" target="_blank">The GitHub Data Challenge II</a>.
So, it was very simple and concise implementaion for proof of concept.
I've been aggregated convention data for a year.
However, It is not analyze conventions of our codes deeply.
I think therefore it's meaningless to keep aggregating more data.
Finally, I decided to stop aggregating.
I only hope someone get insight from this project and make much better projects.</article><time><span class="icons fui-bubble-16"/> Mar 10, 2014</time><article>fixed a error in "Parentheses around arguments in def" of Ruby.

Because I'm not the rubist.</article><time><span class="icons fui-bubble-16"/> July 21, 2013</time><article>added "single quote vs double quotes" convention for JavaScript.</article><time><span class="icons fui-bubble-16"/> July 17, 2013</time><article>I made this site for proof of my concept at

Amazing thing happened. This project placed in second on
<a href="https://github.com/blog/1544-data-challenge-ii-results" target="_blank">Data Challenge II Results</a>
and a lot of people like my idea.<br/>
So, I decided to serve as a service and aggregate more convention data continuously.<br/>
I reseted convention data at all and aggregate newly since old data structure isn't efficient and has some bugs.<br/>
And convention data can be reset sometimes when I found some bugs.

Please leave issues on <a href="https://github.com/outsideris/popularconvention/issues" target="_target">Github</a>
if you have some problems or opinion.<br/>
Thank you for your interest.
