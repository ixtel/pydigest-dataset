<p>Building Shopify applications can be intimidating when you’re getting started, even if you’re an experienced developer.</p>

<p>When I first started, even though I had many years of software engineering experience there were still some tricky concepts, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Authenticating users through OAuth;</li>
<li>Storing tokens to make API calls on behalf of customers; and</li>
<li>Working out the <a href="http://docs.shopify.com/embedded-app-sdk">Embedded App SDK</a>, Shopify’s recommended way of building Shopify apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>After a little while, I got kind of familiar with how things worked, and bundled together what I’d learnt into a helpful Django package.
It’s called <code>django-shopify-auth</code>, and you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/discolabs/django-shopify-auth/issues">on GitHub</a>, alongside a <a href="https://github.com/discolabs/auth_demo">demo Django project</a> using the package.</p>

<p>While the demonstration Django project is simple and uncomplicated, I know from my own experience that just looking at an existing sample isn’t always a great way to learn.</p>

<p>That’s why I’ve put together these <strong>five minute screencasts</strong> that show you how to build a working Shopify app in less than 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p>Since I recorded these screencasts, Shopify has added a requirement for applications to specify one or more “Redirection
URLs” from the Partner dashboard (shown here in Part 2).</p>

<p>To avoid getting an OAuth error while customers try to install your application, make sure your application’s settings
include the absolute URL to <code>/login/finalize/</code> (including the trailing slash) in their whitelisted URLs. For example,
if your application resides at <code>https://myapp.example.com</code>, then you should include
<code>https://myapp.example.com/login/finalize/</code> in the “Redirection URL” section of your application settings.</p>
