<p><b>tl;dr;</b> We are willing to commercially support CPython C API in PyPy,
so if you want pypy to support library X, get in touch with me
at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:fijal@baroquesoftware.com">fijal@baroquesoftware.com</a>. Read further for more details.</p>
<p>Python owes a whole lot of its success to the ease of integration
with existing POSIX APIs and legacy applications. For the most parts,
this means calling C (or Fortran) using various ways with the Python
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/">C API</a> being the most commonly used one, either directly or
with the help of tools like <a class="reference external" href="http://cython.org">Cython</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, calling C was one of the sore points of PyPy. We originally
had no way to do it, then we implemented <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> which is loved by few,
hated by many. Next we went ahead and implemented <a class="reference external" href="http://cffi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">cffi</a> which is both
a better way to call C and a much better supported one. cffi has been
a stunning success, becoming one of the most commonly used pypi
package with over 1.5mln downloads happening every month and growing.</p>
<p>This addressed the basic problem of PyPy -- how do I call C? It has
however not addressed a very important problem -- "how do I integrate
with legacy applications?". We were willing to take a step further,
implementing a subset of CPython C API, labelling it "forever beta",
"incomplete" and "slow", just to support the legacy software.</p>
<p>Now, to address the growing need, we're willing to take a step further.
We discussed ways to make the CPython C API faster and more stable with
the promise of supporting it completely in the future. However, since it
is about supporting mostly legacy codebase, me and my company, <a class="reference external" href="http://baroquesoftware.com/">baroquesoftware</a>
want to structure it as a commercial contract.</p>
<p>This is an open bid to find funding primarily through commercial partners
to implement speed and completeness improvements to CPython C API and pool it together
into pypy. The end product will be available, for free for
everyone under the MIT license, but the funding will be structured
as a commercial contract with all the benefits of one.</p>
<p>Get in touch with me, preferably using mail at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:fijal@baroquesoftware.com">fijal@baroquesoftware.com</a>
for more details regarding what can be done for what sort of budget.</p>
