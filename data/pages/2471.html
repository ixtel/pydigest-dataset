<p><strong>We love tech events</strong>. They are exciting, educational, and a great place to network to see how much farther we can get by working together.  Just look at how well received <a href="https://www.loggly.com/blog/reinvent-recap-vendors-view-growing-aws-cloud/" class="vt-p">AWS re:Invent was last month for attendees and vendors</a>!</p>
<p>We’ve been hard at work planning which conferences and events Loggly will attend in 2015 (Don’t you wish you could go to all of them? We do!), but we couldn’t find a comprehensive list of DevOps events and tech conference related gatherings in one place.  We started compiling the information in a doc, and we’re sharing it with you now to help you get a head start on your event schedule for the year!</p>
<p>Whether you are DevOps, Ops, Engineering, Developer, IT or SysAdmin professional (or a blend of a few), <b>there are a TON of great conferences for you to attend coming up in 2015</b>. Even if you can’t make it, many of these conferences offer live-streaming options. Our personal favorites? <a href="http://devopsdays.org/" title="DevOps Days" target="_blank" class="vt-p">DevOps Days</a>, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="AWS re:Invent" target="_blank" class="vt-p">AWS re:Invent</a>, and <a href="http://futurestack.io/" title="FutureStack" target="_blank" class="vt-p">New Relic’s FutureStack</a>.</p>
<p>Bookmark this page as we will be updating it with promo codes and special registration coupons.  See you at the events!</p>
