<p>For some reason, I doubt that there were no homicides in all of 2010, so I will assume that the data set is not complete for 2010. I am fairly certain the data is updated every month, so 206 for 2015 is actually slightly behind the current number (as of August 25th) of 215. It is only the end of August and we have already passed last years numbers! To put this in perspective, despite having fewer residents, by end of July this year Baltimore boasted 26 more homicides than Detroit(see <a href="https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2015/08/07/baltimore-surges-past-detroit-in-number-of-homicides-in-2015/">this</a> for more). Charm City certainly has its problems as evidenced by the data, but it sure is a great place to live.</p>
<p>We could dig through more by neighborhood or plot the incidents on a map (maps are a pain for me at the moment, otherwise I would include one), but I have gotten a picture of the areas I care about. Since this loads data from the internet, you are more than welcome to play with the notebook and investigate areas you care about. You can access the notebook <a href="https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/baltimore_notebooks/blob/master/baltimore_crimes.ipynb">here</a>. If you have feedback or suggestions please let me know as I am new to this data science space.</p>
<p>For convenience, below I have added a function to generate a report for a specified neighborhood. As an example, I used it on Hampden.</p>
