<p>Have you hit the edge of your creativity? Writing music got you down? Want to sound like your favourite artists? </p>

<p>Enter 'lyrics can be easy,' your one stop lyrics production shop.</p>

<p>Using python 3 and the wonderful 'pymarkovchain' in conjunction with <a href="http://api.lyricsnmusic.com/">http://api.lyricsnmusic.com/</a> this script is incredibly small and fairly fast.</p>

<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>The snippet of lyrics is pulled via the API (unfortunately just a "preview" but it would be easy to integrate this into other services) and then fed into the markov chain generator to print out a line or lines of pseudo-lyrics</p>

<p><strong>APIs</strong></p>

<p>Currently support:</p>



<p>default is lyricsnmusic.</p>

<p><strong>known issues</strong></p>

<p>Full lyrics cannot be retrieved from free API service, so you'll have to live with 1/7th of the song :(</p>

<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>



<p><code>pip install pymarkovchain</code></p>

<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>

<pre><code>./lyrics_can_be_easy.py -h

$  cat lyrics.txt
You're like your head around
Morning falls like you
Confessor of pain in seconds of my presence
You left for you know if I turned you
And she wrote down
to my window
Talk like your seclusion
White summer rain, in
And I've got you run
[reversed
Now I can't get
Dead
Calling the way
The last
Aching
I
These matters
Like the quiet moments
By the sill
Enduring yet
And I'm walking behind with shadows on the start to let you go
I had a wound that whole lot
Halting at the words I fall down word you think you
But now
And I said I think you're already leaving
I wrote
Twisted face
Don't you shut down under the vile
Baying behind you wanna believe
Don't it came passing by

Puzzled and higher ground,
How we come in
I hold now, so I hold now
Suck
What is near
snatching me on a box of Area 51
Feast like a sultan I wouldn't have a test
Looking to say the ocean"
Looking for a snake
Boredom's not a vacation from my infancy
