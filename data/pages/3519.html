                            It always depends on your problem. As usual in data science projects keep in mind that it's likely you're
                            going to need to complete a number of steps in advance to clean and/or classify your documents/data. It would be great to have people
                            with some computer science experience and some knowledge of Machine Learning in your team, but if you don't

                            This is not magic. To succeed you will need humans in the loop to help IEPY train the models (Active Learning).
                            Also to succeed with Information Extraction you should have one or more explicit
