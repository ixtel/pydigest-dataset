<p><b>Geospatial Analysis </b>  <br/></p>
<p>The shift towards mobile computing is driving changes in the way that we manage information. The increased processing power and availability of geolocation data have placed a new emphasis on geospatial analysis. Geographic information systems (GIS) were established in industries whose primary business is knowing “where in the world” their interests are. Oil and gas, mining, and governments were responsible for the development of much of the technology and methods that are commonly used. Today, the advertising, medicine, insurance, environmental, and technology industries also rely heavily on geospatial analysis. The presentation will provide a high level overview of geospatial analysis, covering topics such as geometric data structures, projections, geocoding, and visualization. That will be followed with an overview of foundational software programs for both standard and geospatial data analysis, as well as, key python libraries. The use of these libraries will be shown with some code examples.  <br/></p>

<p><b>Code visualization</b> <br/></p> 
<p>The talk is about a technology and a tool which enables generation of flowchart-like diagrams on the fly while an arbitrary python code is typed. The technology enables not only viewing the diagrams but modifying them as well opening the future for the features which could not be introduced for the text at all. This is a two part talk. The first part covers a quick introduction into the diagrams, the tool and a discussion of the graphics primitives to be used. The second part will cover the implementation of the path from text to graphics which is done mostly in python. Also a future of the technology will be covered in the second part. The slides are available at</p>
