Just recently, I was looking to fill an excel sheet with all possible permutations of five numbers : 1,2,3,4,5 . One permutation in each cell. The excel sheet was a test case document and each permutation meant to go in each cell was a test case.</p><p>
I was looking to write permutations in below format.</p><p>
e.g.</p><p>
1--&gt;2--&gt;3--&gt;5--&gt;4</p><p>
Which meant From condition one, code should enter condition 2, then condition 3, then condition 5, then condition 4 which described 1 test case scenario.
</p><p>
Writing all the 120 permutations (5!) by hand was painful. Was looking for getting the permutations printed on screen programmatically.</p><p>
Turned to python. Python has module itertools which provides lot of functions for various iterators to loop the input data.</p><p>
But the problem was I was looking output from the permutations logic as below:</p><p>
1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;5 ( 1st permutation of 1,2,3,4,5)</p><p>
1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;5-&gt;4 ( 2nd permutation)</p><p>
...etc
</p><p>
But this below python code did not gave output as I desired.

</p><pre><code>import itertools  
 print([x for x in itertools.permutations('12345')])</code></pre>
<p>
gives output as</p><p>
[('1', '2', '3', '4', '5'), ('1', '2', '3', '5', '4'),...
</p><p>
List of tuples of characters.
</p><p>
Then tried
</p><pre><code>import itertools  
 a=[1,2,3,4,5]  
 print([x for x in itertools.permutations(a)])  </code></pre>
<p>
This gave closer output to what I needed but still not exactly what I was looking for
</p><p>
[(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3, 5, 4),
</p><p>
List of tuples of numbers
</p><p>
But as I say, if it can be done in life, it can be done using Python:
</p><p>
I coded as below to output of the permutations, exactly as as I wanted:

</p><pre><code>import itertools  
 a=[1,2,3,4,5]  
 permuted_a = [x for x in itertools.permutations(a)]  
 len_perm = len(permuted_a)  
 for i in range(len_perm):  
   print permuted_a[i][0],'--&gt;',permuted_a[i][1],'--&gt;',permuted_a[i][2],'--&gt;',permuted_a[i][3],'--&gt;',permuted_a[i][4] </code></pre>
<p>
This generated output as below:</p><p>
1 --&gt; 2 --&gt; 3 --&gt; 4 --&gt; 5</p><p>
1 --&gt; 2 --&gt; 3 --&gt; 5 --&gt; 4</p><p>
1 --&gt; 2 --&gt; 4 --&gt; 3 --&gt; 5</p><p>
1 --&gt; 2 --&gt; 4 --&gt; 5 --&gt; 3</p><p>
1 --&gt; 2 --&gt; 5 --&gt; 3 --&gt; 4
</p><p>
Just copied the console output from above and pasted to my excel sheet.</p><p>
One permutation, in one cell of the excel sheet.</p><p>
Voila! Just works.
