<p>Since you're installing via pip, you should be using the most recent version of psycopg2 (2.6.1).
After a little digging through the code, it seems that the exception is being thrown in connection_int.c, which directly calls the postgresql-c-libraries to set up the db-connection. The call happens like so:</p>

<pre><code>self-&gt;pgconn = pgconn = PQconnectStart(self-&gt;dsn);

Dprintf("conn_connect: new postgresql connection at %p", pgconn);

if (pgconn == NULL)
{
    Dprintf("conn_connect: PQconnectStart(%s) FAILED", self-&gt;dsn);
    PyErr_SetString(OperationalError, "PQconnectStart() failed");
    return -1;
}
else if (PQstatus(pgconn) == CONNECTION_BAD)
{
    Dprintf("conn_connect: PQconnectdb(%s) returned BAD", self-&gt;dsn);
    PyErr_SetString(OperationalError, PQerrorMessage(pgconn));
    return -1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The keywords which were specified in your connect statement to psycopg2.connect() are being handled to that function and errors are returned as OperationalError exception.</p>

<p>The error is actually being generated directly in the postgresql-lib - you may want to check which version you are using, how it was built and, if possible, upgrade it to a version with SSL support or rebuilt it from source with SSL enabled.</p>

<p>The postgresql-docs also state that missing SSL support will raise an error, if the sslmode is set to <strong>require</strong>, <strong>verify-ca</strong> or <strong>verify-full</strong>. See <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS" rel="nofollow">here</a> under <code>sslmode</code> for reference.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/" rel="nofollow">postgres-website</a> lists several ways to install postgres from binary packages, so you might choose one which suits your needs. I'm not familiar with OSX, so I don't have a recommendation what's best.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10132274/install-libpq-dev-on-mac-os-x">This</a> question may also be helpful.</p>

<p>You also need to reinstall the psycopg2-module, be sure to use the newly installed lib when rebuilding it. Refer to the linked question (in short, you will need to place the path to <code>pg_config</code> which is included in your new installation to $PATH when running <code>pip install psycopg2</code>).</p>
