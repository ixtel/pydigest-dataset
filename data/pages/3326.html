<h2>DjangoCon Europe 2015 update</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Daniele Procida</strong> on February 18, 2015 </span>

<p>2015's DjangoCon Europe will take place in Cardiff, Wales, from the 31st May to the 5th June, for six days of talks, tutorials and code. Here's what's new:</p>
<div class="section" id="s-the-dates">
<h3>The dates</h3>
<p>Hilariously, after seven months of planning, we were forced by a boy band to change the event's original dates. <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/news/boy-band-disrupts-djangocon-europe/">How we laughed</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-tickets">
<h3>Tickets</h3>
<p>Tickets are selling well and the early-bird ticket rate will end in the next day or so. After that all ticket prices will go up by Â£50. They're still going to be exceptionally good value, given that it's a six-day event and that as well as talks it'll be packed with tutorials, workshops and clinics.</p>
<p>We also have 'donation' tickets - these will support the attendance of delegates on lower budgets, and we're proud to say that numerous people - <em>including some people who can't even make it themselves, but still want to make a contribution</em> - have bought them to support others.</p>

<h3>About those workshops and clinics</h3>
<p>At the time of writing we have...</p>
<div class="section" id="s-for-the-open-day-31st-may">
<h4>For the open day (31st May)</h4>

</div>
<div class="section" id="s-alongside-the-sprints-4th-and-5th-june">
<h4>Alongside the sprints (4th and 5th June)</h4>
<p>These are more advanced sessions. Some of them are on their own worth more than the price of the ticket for the entire conference. Come to DjangoCon and they're free.</p>

<p>Would you like to offer a workshop or other session? <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/proposals/">We'd love to hear about it</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="s-live-speech-to-text-transcription">
<h3>Live speech-to-text transcription</h3>
<p>For the Deaf, those with hearing impairments or simply people whose first language is not English, there'll be <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/welcome/accessibility/">live transcriptions of all talks</a> (amongst other accessibility measures).</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="s-keep-the-talk-proposals-coming">
<h3>Keep the talk proposals coming</h3>
<p>It looks like our efforts to improve diversity are helping: we've received a very decent number of excellent talk proposals from people who aren't the usual youngish white men. But, we still haven't had as many as we were hoping for - so keep them coming, and encourage others to submit theirs.</p>
<p>Whoever you are, <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/proposals/">please let us have your talk proposals</a>. We're thrilled every time a new one arrives.</p>
<p>The deadline's on the 18th March, just four weeks from today.</p>

<h3>Things you need to know</h3>
<div class="section" id="s-accommodation">
<h4>Accommodation</h4>
<p><em>As soon as you know you're coming</em>, <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/welcome/accommodation/">please book your accommodation</a>. Your organising committee chair is living in fear of another unannounced boy band.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="s-getting-here">
<h4>Getting here</h4>
<p>There's a lot of <a class="reference external" href="http://2015.djangocon.eu/welcome/getting-here/">travel information</a>, including detailed information about travel to Cardiff from half-a-dozen different airports. Make use of it; it could save you a lot of time and money.</p>
