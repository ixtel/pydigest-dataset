<p>Co-authored with <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/audreyr">Audrey Roy Greenfeld</a>, the <a class="reference external" href="http://twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8">1.8 edition</a> of <em>Two Scoops of Django</em> is filled to the brim with knowledge to help make Django projects better. We introduce various tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, and techniques that we've picked up over the years. What we didn't know or weren't certain about, we found the best experts in the world and asked them for the answers. Then we packed the result into a 500+ page book.</p>
