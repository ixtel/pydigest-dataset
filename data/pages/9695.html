  <p>I am writing this post just after two extraordinary weeks in Namibia. This is a
quick personal reflection of what has been an awesome experience. As part of
Cardiff University’s <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project">Phoenix
Project</a>, <a href="http://www.unam.edu.na/faculty-of-science/mathematics/our-team/?staffid=5042">Martin
Mugochi</a>,
<a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/98670-wilson-robert">Rob Wilson</a> and I
with Cardiff PhD students <a href="https://twitter.com/geraintpalmer">Geraint Palmer</a>
and Alex MacKay worked with the University of Namibia’s faculty of Mathematics
to deliver a two week summer school.</p>

<p>The goal of this joint effort with the University of Namibia was to provide a
positive experience of mathematics. As Rob said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want them to concentrate on what they can do rather than what they cannot
do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The first week involved inquiry based sessions on both mathematical topics (such
as Algebra and Geometry) as well as wider skills (such as presenting and reading
mathematics).</strong></p>

<p>This side of the course mainly involved students working on through activities
and presenting them to the class which lead to discussion (and in an IBL way
ultimately confirmation/verification of the conclusions). This is the point at
which we (I’m sure Rob, Alex and Geraint would agree) must say that the
<strong>students were awesome</strong>. Eager to learn, open to the novel pedagogic ideas, a
real pleasure to work with.</p>

<p>Here are some photos of the first week (the only local ones as I write this are
from the group Alex and I took but things were pretty much the same in Rob and
Geraint’s group):</p>

<p>The second week had students work in groups on a variety of projects such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mathematical paradoxes,</li>
  <li>Patterns in Pascal’s triangle,</li>
  <li>History of mathematics</li>
</ul>

<p>From the intensity of the first week, this lead to a stark contrast in which
students came to us for support. This lead to us not being in direct contact
with all the students all the time.</p>

<p>The culmination of the whole school was a 2 hour closing ceremony in which
students presented their posters. As we hadn’t seen all the groups we were
slightly worried that this might fall flat on it’s face but we were very wrong
and it was such a delight to see each and every group turn up to put their
awesome poster on the wall.</p>

<p>Here are some of the posters:</p>

<p><img src="/unpeudemath/assets/images/UNAM_Summer_poster_2.jpg" alt="Patterns in Pascals triangle"/></p>

<p>Without any nudge on our part students starting walking around and learning from
each other’s poster (<strong>I am still smiling about this now</strong>). This was followed
by students giving 5 minute presentations, closing remarks from various UNAM
officials, Martin Mugochi (head of the mathematics department) and ourselves.</p>

<p>One of my most pleasant memories (of which there are too many to mention) is
what happened just after that though, we (students and us) came together to
<strong>thank each other</strong> for our efforts and get photos:</p>

<p>This was such a great experience, it was fantastic to work and become good
friends with Martin, get to know the students (seeing the benefits of active
pedagogic methodologies) and spend two great weeks with Geraint, Alex and Rob:</p>

<p><strong>This is just one of many <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project">Phoenix project</a> projects and it’s great to be
involved.</strong></p>

<p>Now I need to put this laptop down, get a good night’s sleep and spend tomorrow
working on final details for <a href="http://na.pycon.org/">PyCon Namibia</a>.</p>
