<p>The EuroPython Society (EPS) is happy to announce that we have decided to accept the proposal from the on-site team <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pyss.org%2F&amp;t=ODUwZDAzNmFkNTA5NWViNzIyNmNhZTYxMTBkNGI0ZWUxNzAxY2Q5NCxia1pWRWhzWA%3D%3D">ACPySS</a> in Spain to hold EuroPython 2015 in Bilbao, Spain. The decision was made in Monday’s EPS board meeting.</p>
<p>We are <strong>extremely happy</strong> to have received the proposal and would like to thank everyone from the ACPySS team for their work on the excellent submission:</p>
<p>The cooperation with the ACPySS throughout the proposal process has been very productive. The EPS board is now working together with the ACPySS on the venue selection. The conference dates will be announced as soon as we have finalized the venue.</p>
<h3>Sponsoring EuroPython</h3>
<p>Companies who would like to signup as EuroPython 2015 sponsor are encouraged to contact the sponsor workgroup at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=mailto%3Asponsoring%40europython.eu&amp;t=ZDMyNjhhODNkZWIwY2RkMjU1NjlkMjQ1ZmYzNjU2MDJhM2U3MjY2YSxia1pWRWhzWA%3D%3D">sponsoring@europython.eu</a>. We will be taking on launch sponsors early in January.</p>
<p>The two venues we have for the conference have plenty of room for sponsor booths, so we will try to make EuroPython 2015 as effective as possible for sponsors by offering more booth space and sponsors slots than ever before.</p>
<p>This is your chance to reach out to more than a thousand enthusiastic and highly motivated EuroPython attendees !</p>
