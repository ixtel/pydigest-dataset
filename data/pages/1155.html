<h2>DjangoCon US 2014 program announced</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Russell Keith-Magee</strong> on August 13, 2014 </span>

<p>It's taken longer than we would have liked, but the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangocon.us/schedule/">DjangoCon US 2014 program is now official</a>. In September, we'll be treated to 40 talks, ranging from case studies on Django use in unusual industries, deep dives into technical aspects of using Django and it's ecosystem, to the social aspects of being involved in a technical community. <a class="reference external" href="http://dcus14.eventbrite.com/">Tickets are still available</a> (including earlybird tickets for another day or so), and if the program is any indication it's going to be an amazing show.</p>
<p>However, we know that attending DjangoCon US can be an expensive exercise, and as a result, some people may not be able to attend due to financial hardship. To ensure that as many people as possible can attend DjangoCon US, the <a class="reference external" href="https://djangoproject.com/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a> is announcing a travel grant program for the event. If you require financial assistance to attend DjangoCon US, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vEwGOPrYoj0cQoYoAV8bZ9jTr5XnWMAflcKlRrnnoHo/viewform?usp=send_form">fill in this form</a>. We can't guarantee that we'll be able to satisfy every request for aid, but we'll do our best to make sure as many people, from as diverse a background as possible, can attend. Applications are open until <strong>August 22</strong>; we'll aim to notify successful applicants by August 25.</p>
<p>See you in Portland in a few weeks!</p>
