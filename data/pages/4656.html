<h1>Python Human Name Parser<a class="headerlink" href="#python-human-name-parser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Version 0.3.11</p>
<p>A simple Python module for parsing human names into their individual
components. It attempts the best guess that can be made with a simple, rule-based
approach. It’s not perfect, but it gets you pretty far.</p>
<p>Its main use case is English, but it may be useful for other latin-based languages, especially
if you are willing to <a class="reference external" href="customize.html">customize it</a>. Unicode is supported, but the
parser is not likely to be useful for languages that to not share the same structure
as English names.</p>
<p>The HumanName class splits a name string up into name parts based
on placement in the string and matches against known name pieces like titles.
It joins name pieces on conjunctions and special prefixes to last names like
“del”. Titles can be chained together and include conjunctions to handle
titles like “Asst Secretary of State”. It can also try to correct
capitalization.</p>

<h2>HumanName Instance Attributes<a class="headerlink" href="#humanname-instance-attributes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>o.title</li>
<li>o.first</li>
<li>o.middle</li>
<li>o.last</li>
<li>o.suffix</li>
<li>o.nickname</li>
</ul>
<p>Supports 3 different comma placement variations in the input string.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Title Firstname “Nickname” Middle Middle Lastname Suffix</li>
<li>Lastname [Suffix], Title Firstname (Nickname) Middle Middle[,] Suffix [, Suffix]</li>
<li>Title Firstname M Lastname [Suffix], Suffix [Suffix] [, Suffix]</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is ambiguity that cannot be resolved by a rule-based approach,
HumanName prefers to handle the most common cases correctly. For example,
“Dean” is not parsed as title because it is more common as a first name
(You can customize this behavior though, see <a class="reference external" href="customize.html#parser-customization-examples">Parser Customization Examples</a>).</p>
