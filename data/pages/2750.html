There is a <u><a href="https://www.fundedbyme.com/en-us/campaign/5065/supporting-python-3/">campaign</a></u> underway to get the book updated and free for all to read / contribute to. Have a <u><a href="https://www.fundedbyme.com/en-us/campaign/5065/supporting-python-3/">look</a></u> and see if you like to support it.</strong></p><p>2014 has seen increased adoption of Python 3</p><ul><li>Only <u><a href="https://python3wos.appspot.com/">32 of top 200</a></u> most used Python Packages are not supported by 3.x release.</li><li>Ubuntu just did away with Python 2 from their latest LTS release. Fedora is next in line,</li><li>Python 3.x download % on official website is more or less equal to Python 2.x. Thus hinting at increased adoption.</li></ul><p>New features / changes in Python 3.x with no backporting to 2.x series. <u><a href="http://sealedabstract.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/changes/05_python.pdf">changelog output</a></u> is compelling reason to adopt Python 3.x.</p><p>However Majority of in-production Python software are in 2.x . It's here the relevance of "Porting to Python 3: An in-depth guide" - written by Lennart Regebro comes into picture.</p><ul><li>Say you want to port the codebase to 3.x Take a look at the <u><a href="http://python3porting.com/strategies.html">Strategies for Porting</a></u> chapter,</li><li>Rather then learn by<strike>trail</strike>trial and error you could read up on <u><a href="http://python3porting.com/problems.html">common migrations problems</a></u> while porting.</li><li>The book also talks about the newer features of Python to improve your codebase as you port.</li></ul><p>â€œPorting to Python 3? is in need of an update since Python 2.5 and 3.2 are in a way obsolete for Majority of Python Developers. Lennart sadly has less time. But he has decided to convert it into a community book, put it up on GitHub and give the Python Software Foundation a license to use it. However to make that a reality he has to clean up the current repository which is in a mess, and thus require efforts.</p><p>This <u><a href="https://www.fundedbyme.com/en-us/campaign/5065/supporting-python-3/">campaign</a></u>, is to get some funding to make it happen. Have a look at the <u><a href="https://www.fundedbyme.com/en-us/campaign/5065/supporting-python-3/">campaign</a></u> and see if you can contribute. You contribution will result in a Free for all "Porting to Python 3 Book" updated and available on Github.</p><h5 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h5><p><u><a href="https://twitter.com/regebro">Lennart Regebro</a></u> has been coding in Python since 1999 ( that's the last century for you ).
