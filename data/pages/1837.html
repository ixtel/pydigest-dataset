						<p>I can’t seem to find much discussion online contrasting dynamic and static typing as <em>teaching</em> tools. Others have covered the technical merits up and down, but I wanted to make a case for static typing for teaching new programmers.</p>
<p>It’s true that it’s easier, even necessary, to elide abstract concepts like types when first starting out. Dynamically typed programming languages (like Python, Ruby, or JavaScript) allow learners to get started quickly and see results right away. It’s important not to underestimate the importance of that quick, tight feedback loop! While getting started, students don’t need to know that “Hello World” is skating on layers of abstractions on the way to the screen.</p>
<p>At the risk of veering into criticizing dynamic typing itself (which isn’t my intention!) languages like Ruby and Python unfortunately also lengthen the feedback cycle between making certain kinds of mistakes and seeing an error produced from them. In the worst cases, the error becomes much more difficult to understand when it occurs. Testing becomes crucial to ferret out these kinds of errors.</p>
<p>That’s a relatively minor concern of mine, though. I’m more concerned about what happens when a student turns into a new programmer interacting with a non-trivial system. It’s inevitable that a new programmer will have to learn an existing complex system—if not on the job, then at the least while learning a web framework. At this point, she will have to use or modify some part of the system <em>before</em> understanding the whole. In other words, a new programmer will have to point at a symbol or word on the screen and ask, “What is that?”</p>
<p>In a language like Ruby or Python, it literally takes longer to figure out what a variable on the screen represents, and it sometimes requires searching through many files and holding many abstractions in your head to understand any non-trivial piece of source code. Using or modifying a complex system requires deeper and more expert knowledge of the system. It’s for this reason that I feel static typing helps peel away abstractions. It also makes information about the system more explicit, closer at hand, and more readily searchable.</p>
<p>I find it ironic in the case of Python especially. “Explicit is better than implicit,” say the Pythonistas—except when it comes to types?</p>
