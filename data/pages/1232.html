<p>Every time I would prepare a matplotlib graph for a paper, I would iteratively adjust the figure size, the font size, scaling in LaTeX. This turns to be a tedious process. Fortunately, when along with <a href="http://www.jack-kelly.com/">Jack</a> and <a href="http://www.oliverparson.co.uk/">Oliver</a>, I was writing our <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.3878v1.pdf">nilmtk paper</a>, Jack demonstrated a function to "latexify" plots. This function would take care of font sizes and scaling, so that in one go one could generate a plot and stick in LaTeX. In this post I'll illustrate this technique to save all that iterative effort and make plots look nicer.</p>
