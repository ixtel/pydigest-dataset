Data values are usually mapped to different color saturations for numerical variables or color hues for categorical variables. Different patterns can also be used, but that is not as common. Typical examples are maps that show election results.</p>
<p>There are different approaches on how to create such a map in Python. In this notebook I'll show how you can use the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/basemap/">Matplotlib Basemap Toolkit</a> to create a choropleth map of the world. The data that will be plotted shows forest area as a percentage of land area in 2012 <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.FRST.ZS/">provided by the World Bank</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Setup">Setup<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setup">¶</a></h2><p>There is no <em>choropleth for humans</em> package in Python, so this task is not as straightforward as other things in Python, but it isn't too bad either.</p>
<p>In addition to the data on forest area we need a shapefile with country borders to draw the map. I downloaded the <em>Admin 0 - Countries</em> with lakes from <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/">Natural Earth Data</a> and simplified it a bit with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>ogr2ogr -simplify .05 -lco ENCODING=UTF-8 countries/ ne_10m_admin_0_countries_lakes/ne_10m_admin_0_countries_lakes.shp

</code></pre>
<p>This step is optional and only for speeding up processing a bit. To run this command you need to install the <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL library</a>.</p>
<p>Now let's get started with the actual Python code. First load the necessary modules and specify the files for input and output, set the number of colors to use and meta information about what is displayed.</p>
