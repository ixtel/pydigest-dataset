<html><body><div><p>Falcon is a minimalist WSGI library for building speedy web APIs and app
backends. We like to think of Falcon as the <cite>Dieter Rams</cite> of web frameworks.</p>
<p>When it comes to building HTTP APIs, other frameworks weigh you down with tons
of dependencies and unnecessary abstractions. Falcon cuts to the chase with a
clean design that embraces HTTP and the REST architectural style.</p>

<p>“Falcon looks great so far. I hacked together a quick test for a
tiny server of mine and was ~40% faster with only 20 minutes of
work.”</p>
<p>“I’m loving #falconframework! Super clean and simple, I finally
have the speed and flexibility I need!”</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m just talking HTTP at last, with nothing in the
middle. Falcon seems like the requests of backend.”</p>
<p>“The source code for falcon is so good, I almost prefer it to
documentation. It basically can’t be wrong.”</p>
<p>“What other framework has integrated support for ‘786 TRY IT NOW’ ?”</p>
