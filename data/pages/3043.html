<h2>Django Fellowship fundraising goal achieved! </h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Ola Sitarska, Jannis Leidel</strong> on January 27, 2015 </span>

<p>YAY! Thanks to the amazing help from the Django community all over the world, we just crossed the <a class="reference external" href="/fundraising/">Django Fellowship Fundraising campaign</a> goal of US $30,000 with a significant donation from the Django Under The Hood conference and the Django Dutch Association.</p>
<div class="section" id="s-you-are-all-awesome">
<h3><strong>You. Are. All. Awesome.</strong></h3>
<p>We are incredibly grateful for your continuous support and encouragement. <strong>More than 150 companies and individuals helped us to continue the Django Fellowship Program in just under 6 days</strong>. This exceeds all of our wildest expectations. The Django community is what makes all the work that the contributors and volunteers put into development of Django <em>worthwhile</em>. Thanks to you, we will be able to develop and maintain Django in a more stable and consistent way, with better code reviews and timely releases.</p>

<h3><strong>The next goal</strong></h3>
<p>Of course, there is always more that can be done and we don’t want to stop here. We also realize that ending this campaign just after 6 days would mean that lots of people and companies would not get an opportunity to contribute and help the cause they care about.</p>
<p><strong>This is why we’ve decided to extend the goal to US $50,000, which would allow the Django Software Foundation to expand the program even further.</strong></p>
<p>Once we reach the goal of US $50,000, we will focus on <strong>making the program sustainable by making it easy for everyone to create a smaller recurring donation and fill the Django heart with pixels of love on a monthly basis</strong>. This will allow the Foundation to carry on with the work without contributing a significant resources and time for fundraising campaign every quarter.</p>

<h3><strong>Help us spread the word</strong></h3>
<p>Despite an <em>amazing</em> effort coming from the whole community, we know that our message hasn't reached everyone yet. And there are a lot more Django users and companies that can help us make it happen. <strong>So please, talk to the companies you work for and let us know how we can help them.</strong> There are always alternative ways to donate or partner with the <a class="reference external" href="/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>. We would be more than happy to find a solution that works for everyone and we’re very open to hear your thoughts. <a class="reference external" href="/contact/foundation/">Get in touch with us here</a>.</p>
