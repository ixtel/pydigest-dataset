      <p>In this very <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Multiple-Blinking-LED-on-the-Arduino/" rel="nofollow">popular instructable</a> you can see how to blink multiple LEDs using <strong>delay()</strong> in the <strong>loop()</strong> function. This logic it's OK if you want to blink them all at once or if you want to blink one after the other or to do other simple effects.</p><p>But what if you want to blink the LEDs at different rates? This question comes up practically every day on the Arduino forum and this is where the delay() function doesn't really help. In fact, in Arduino using delay() has a side effect - the Arduino does nothing for that while. To get two or more "actions" to run independent of each other, you cannot use delay().</p><p>To resolve this problem, there are many solutions, more or less difficult:</p><p/><ul><li>using millis() [<a href="http://wikibox.stanford.edu/12-13/index.php/Assignments/BasicArduinoMultiTaskTutorial#toc4" rel="nofollow">link</a>]</li><li>using a table driven approach [<a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/MultiBlink" rel="nofollow">link</a>]</li><li>using a Finite-State Machine logic [<a href="http://www.gammon.com.au/statemachine" rel="nofollow">link</a>]</li></ul><p>However, designers and non-programmers users are frustrated by the difficulties in implementing such functionalities in microcontrollers. They just want their prototype and product to work.</p><p>In order to solve these pains, VIPER supports all the most used high-level features of Python like modules, classes, <strong>multithreading</strong>, callbacks, timers and exceptions, plus some custom hardware-related features like interrupts, PWM, digital I/O, etc.</p><p><a href="http://www.viperize.it/" rel="nofollow">VIPER </a> is an easy to use development suite for the high level design of interactive objects ready for the cloud and the IoT. VIPER is composed of an cross-platform IDE, a mobile APP &amp; a Virtual Machine that runs on various platforms. With VIPER creatives, designers and professionals can develop in Python for Arduino DUE, ST Nucleo and most of Particle (formerly Spark) products, and similar boards using paradigms and features typical of PC and mobile programming.</p>
