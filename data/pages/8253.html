This website hosts the tkhtml.tcl.tk project, an experiment in creating
modern web browser components based on the Tcl/Tk platform. Currently
this consists of two pieces of software and their accompanying 
documentation:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><td>
       <a href="hv3.html" class="bigred">Hv3</a>
   </td><td>Hv3 is a cross-platform web browser with support for modern
       web standards like HTML, CSS, HTTP and ECMAScript (a.k.a. javascript).

  </td></tr><tr><td>

  </td></tr><tr><td>
       <a href="tkhtml.html" class="bigred">Tkhtml3</a>
       </td><td>Tkhtml3 is a Tk widget that displays content formatted according
       to the HTML and CSS standards. Tkhtml3 is not an end-user application,
       it is for Tcl programmers who wish to embed a standards-compliant
       HTML/CSS implementation in their applications.
</td></tr></table>

<p>
  There is a mailing list for Hv3 and Tkhtml3 hosted by Google Groups.
  You can join the mailing list, view the archive and post new messages 
  by clicking here:

<p>
  Bug reports, enhancement requests and the project changelog are managed
  by a CVStrac installation. There is also a wiki where users can 
  contribute content. Access CVStrac here:

<h2><a name="part1"/>Documents</h2><p>
</p><ul>
  <li> A 
    <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/community/tcl2007/papers/Dan_Kennedy/file___localhost_...tcl2006_tkhtml3_tcl2006.pdf">paper describing Tkhtml3</a> (www.tcl.tk) 
    was presented at the 2006 Tcl conference. Even though it is a little
    out of date, this is the best general introduction to Tkhtml3 programming
    available. Prospective users should read this paper for a general 
    overview, then proceed to the tkhtml(n) man page to absorp the details.
  </li><li> An early 
    <a href="requirements.html">requirements specification</a> from way 
    back in 2005. This is no longer really relevant, but it's amusing
    in it's own way.
</li></ul>
<h2><a name="part2"/>Source Code</h2><p>
  </p><p>The source code for Tkhtml3 and Hv3 is bundled together as a single
     project for source code management purposes. It can be obtained 
     either by downloading a release tarball, or via anonymous CVS.

  </p><p>Download the <a href="tkhtml3-alpha-16.tar.gz">
      source code for the latest release (alpha 16)</a>.

  </p><p>Or to obtain the lastest source-code from cvs, use the following 
     procedure (from an x-term or command prompt):

    </p><ol>
      <li> Log in with the following command:
    <blockquote>
<pre>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@tkhtml.tcl.tk:/tkhtml login</pre>
    </blockquote>

      </li><li> You will be prompted for a password. Use "<tt>anonymous</tt>".
      </li><li> Obtain the lastest version 3 source code:
    <blockquote>
<pre>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@tkhtml.tcl.tk:/tkhtml checkout htmlwidget</pre>
    </blockquote>
    </li></ol>

<h2><a name="part3"/>Participation</h2><p>
  tkhtml.tcl.tk is an open-source project, and so requires community
  participation to succeed. All are welcome! Here are some of the ways 
  you can participate:

</p><table>
  <tr><td valign="top">
       Using Hv3 </td><td>
    <a href="hv3.html">Download Hv3</a> and browse the web with it 
    for a while. Report any bugs, problems or incompatibilities that you
    encounter. Make some suggestions for improvements.
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
       Using Tkhtml3 </td><td>
    Write a program that uses Tkhtml3, or embed it into an existing
    program. Comment on your experience doing so and report any bugs.
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
       Join The Mailing List</td><td>
    Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tkhtml3">

  </td></tr><tr><td>
  </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
       Help Out With The Website</td><td>
    As you can see, the website isn't up to much at the moment (ironic eh?).

    a mac osx build, please get in touch.
  </td></tr><tr><td>
  </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">
       Join The Development Team</td><td>
    If you can program in C, Tcl or javascript, then you are welcome to

    improve, post a message to the mailing list, and go from there. 
</td></tr></table>

<h2><a name="part4"/>Contacts</h2><p>
  It is best to join the 
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tkhtml3">mailing list</a> and
