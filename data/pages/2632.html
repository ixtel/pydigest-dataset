<h2>Bugfix releases issued</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on January 2, 2015 </span>

<p>Today we're issuing the second bugfix release in the 1.7 release series (with nearly 60 fixes!), along with bugfix releases for each of the other supported release series (1.4 and 1.6), plus another "final" bugfix release of the 1.5 series. Although Django 1.5 is technically already past its end-of-life, another regression discovered in the last 1.5 release prompted another release.</p>
<p>Details can be found in the release notes for each release series:</p>

<p>The release packages and checksums are, as always, available from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a>, as well as from the Python Package Index. The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
