								<p>We’re pleased to announce that Splash 2.0 is officially live after many months of hard work.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Splash, it’s a headless browser we developed specifically for web crawling. Splash executes and renders JavaScript so you can deal with dynamic content. It also supports scripting so you can perform actions on the page.</p>
<p>Splash is open source and fully integrated with Scrapy and Portia. You can also use its API to integrate with any project that needs to render JavaScript pages. Splash is included with Scrapy Cloud and is supported without any additional dependencies. You can also run a Splash instance on your own infrastructure, so there is no platform lock-in.</p>
<p>Splash 2.0 now runs on <a href="http://www.qt.io/">Qt 5</a> and brings Python 3 support, lots of UI improvements and many other changes and bug fixes.</p>
<h1>Improvements</h1>
<h2>Python 3 support and Qt 5</h2>
<p>We’ve added support for Python 3 and the Docker container now uses it by default instead of Python 2.</p>
<p>Splash now runs on Qt 5 which brings improved JavaScript and HTML5 features such as CSS filters and canvas.</p>
<p>We would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/sunu">Tarashish Mishra</a>, who joined us through Google Summer of Code 2015, for all his hard work in doing the initial port for Qt 5 and Python 3. If you want to contribute in some of our projects, please stay tuned for GSoC 2016.</p>
<h2>Built-in support for JSON and Base64</h2>
<p>We’ve also included modules for <a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripting-libs.html#lib-json">JSON and </a><a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripting-libs.html#lib-base64">Base64</a> so you no longer need to include foreign libraries.</p>
<h2>Script examples</h2>
<p>You can now find script examples in a new drop-down menu named ‘Examples’:</p>

<h2>Friendlier UI</h2>

<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We fixed a bug which prevented cookies being set via JavaScript as well as one which resulted in cookies being shared across tabs.</p>
<h2>Proxy authentication</h2>
<p>We fixed a bug that prevented users from updating proxy settings after <a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/stable/scripting-request-object.html#request-set-proxy">request:set_proxy</a> had been called.</p>
<h1>Backwards-incompatible changes</h1>
<p>We also made the following backwards-incompatible changes:</p>
<h2>QT-based disk cache</h2>
<p>Splash no longer supports the QT-based disk cache. We have discouraged usage since 1.0 and we recommend using something more reliable like <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>.</p>
<h2>Serialization of JavaScript objects</h2>
<p>We’ve made changes to how <a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripting-ref.html#splash-jsfunc">splash:jsfunc</a>, <a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripting-ref.html#splash-evaljs">splash:evaljs</a> and <a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/scripting-ref.html#splash-wait-for-resume">splash:wait_for_resume</a> serialize objects. Circular objects are no longer returned and DOM elements are no longer serialized.</p>
<h2>Splash-as-a-proxy</h2>
<p>We removed the Splash-as-a-proxy service because it didn’t work with HTTPS and we wanted to reduce the dependency on advanced Twisted features. There was also <a href="https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash/issues/241">an issue with the X-Splash-js-source header</a> due to Python treating headers with values containing new lines as unsafe.</p>
<h2>Splash scripting</h2>
<p>We made a few backwards-incompatible changes to Splash scripting as well and there’s a small chance you will need to update your scripts. Here are the changes we’ve made:</p>
<p>Receiving a response object. You should now use the returned object’s info attribute.<br/>
<code>resp = splash:http_get(...)</code> should be replaced with <code>resp = splash:http_get(...).info</code><br/>
<code>resp = splash:http_post(...)</code> should be replaced with <code>resp = splash:http_post(...).info</code><br/>
You should also do the same for the response object received by <code>splash:on_response_headers</code> and <code>splash:on_response</code>.<br/>
Default encoding of <code>info['content']['text']</code> is now Base64.</p>
<p>You can find the full release notes <a href="http://splash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changes.html#id1">here</a>.</p>
<h1>Wrap Up</h1>
