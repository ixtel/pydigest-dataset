<h2>Event Background</h2>
<p>Less then two weeks before May 12, a bunch of us Los Angeles area Python developers were hanging out and wishing we had a local sprint to attend that was just about developers working on open source projects. It was then that <a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com">Audrey Roy</a> and I, along with an army of hardworking volunteers, decided to stop wishing and make it happen on May 12th.</p>
<p>We lined up a venue, contacted awesome sponsors <a class="reference external" href="http://spire.io">Spire.io</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com">Github</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://cars.com">Cars.com</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://academy.cartwheelweb.com">Cartwheel Academy</a>. As we did that, we also invited people from the many Los Angeles programming communities in Los Angeles to join us. The result of everyone's hard work? <strong>We filled up all sixty spots in less than 96 hours!</strong></p>
<p>Some of the projects worked on included:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Salt Stack: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt">https://github.com/saltstack/salt</a></li>
<li>A node.js-powered streaming terminal, allowing for shared input at a terminal among several participants.</li>
<li>A JavaScript powered astrolabe.</li>
<li>Settlers of Catan analytics in JavaScript.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">OpenFrameworks</a>, a cross-platform toolkit for creative coding in C++.</li>
<li>My own time at the sprint was spent with Audrey Roy and <a class="reference external" href="http://rdegges.com">Randall Degges</a> on engineering cleanup and fixing bugs on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/opencomparison/opencomparison">OpenComparison</a>.</li>
</ul>
