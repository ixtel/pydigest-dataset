              <p>Open Terminal (or Docker QuickStart Terminal).</p><p>Run the following command:</p><p/><pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -it ubuntu:14.04 /bin/bash</code></pre><p>Let's take a look at what this command does.</p><p>The <strong>docker run</strong> command lets you start a container from an image. In this case, you are creating a container from the <strong>ubuntu:14.04</strong> image. This is the <strong>ubuntu</strong> image with the <strong>14.04</strong> tag.</p><p>Each Docker container should run a single process. So the <strong>docker run</strong> command lets you specify a single command to run inside of the container. In our case, we are going to run a bash shell. So we've specified the command to run as <strong>/bin/bash</strong>. Since we are running a bash shell we are going to want to allocate a pseudo-TTY and keep STDIN open. This is why we've added the options <strong>-it</strong> to the run command.</p><p>After running this command you should see something like this:</p><p/><pre><code class="language-bash">root@69129699ac86:/#</code></pre><p>This is the bash shell running inside of the container you just created from the ubuntu image. You can run <strong>ps</strong> to see which processes are running in this container.</p><p/><pre><code class="language-bash">root@69129699ac86:/# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 ?        00:00:00 bash
   18 ?        00:00:00 ps</code></pre><p>Type <strong>exit</strong> to close the shell. Now you can run <strong>docker ps</strong> to see which containers are currently running. You should find that there are no running containers. But if you run <strong>docker ps -a</strong> you'll see all containers including the one you just stopped. Since the containers are designed to run a single process, once that process is finished the container stops.</p><p>Take a look at the fields displayed by <strong>docker ps -a</strong>. Two important fields are <strong>CONTAINER ID</strong> and <strong>NAMES</strong>. If you want to interact with your containers you'll need to know the name or id.</p><p>If you want to start this container back up you can do so with <strong>docker start -ai <container id=""/></strong>. Since the COMMAND associated with this container is /bin/bash we need to attach STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR, hence the <strong>-ai</strong> options.</p><p>Theoretically we could run our container in the background. If our command was something else, say <strong>python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000</strong>, we would likely want to run our container in the background. In this case we would be able to see our container running when we type <strong>docker ps</strong>. If we want to run a command on an existing container we will use the <strong>docker exec</strong> command. The exec command offers familiar options, so if we wanted to open a shell in our django container we could type <strong>docker exec -it <container id=""> /bin/bash</container></strong>. </p>
