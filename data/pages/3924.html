<h2>Django 1.8 released</h2>

<span class="meta">Posted by <strong>Tim Graham</strong> on April 1, 2015 </span>

<p>After more than a year of development, the Django team is happy to announce the release of Django 1.8 <a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.8Roadmap">according to schedule</a>.</p>
<p>This version has been designated as a long-term support (LTS) release, which means that security and data loss fixes will be applied for at least the next three years.</p>
<p>As always, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/releases/1.8">the release notes</a> cover everything in-depth, but some of the major highlights are:</p>

<p>You can get Django 1.8 from <a class="reference external" href="/download/">our downloads page</a> or from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django/1.8">the Python Package Index</a>. The PGP key ID used for this release is Tim Graham: 1E8ABDC773EDE252.</p>
<p>With the release of Django 1.8, Django 1.6 has reached end-of-life. As such, Django 1.6.11 is the final release of the 1.6 series. Django 1.7 will continue to receive security updates until the release of Django 1.9 (<a class="reference external" href="https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/Version1.9Roadmap">planned for October 2015</a>). Django 1.4 (the previous LTS) will receive security updates for another six months (ending October 1, 2015) to give time for users to upgrade to Django 1.8 LTS.</p>
