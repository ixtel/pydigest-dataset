<p>Use python as a calculator...</p>








<p>Python libraries such as numpy, sympy, and matplotlib in combination with
IPython make for an excellent desktop calculator. Unfortunately, however,
setting up an ipython session with all the necessary imports takes quite a
while. Pycalc provides a way to quickly import all the libraries necessary for a
powerful calculator without incurring a prohibitive start up time.</p>
<div id="setup">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Pycaclc can be installed from pypi by issuing <cite>pip install –user pycalc</cite>.
Pycaclc does not require for all it’s dependencies to be installed though. To
get the full pycalc experience, run <cite>pip install –user -r
recommended_requirements.txt</cite>.</p>
