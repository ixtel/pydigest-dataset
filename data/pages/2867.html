<h2 id="why-give">Why give to the Django Software Foundation?</h2>

<p>Our main focus is direct support of Django's developers. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing and funding development sprints so that Django's developers can
meet in person.</li>
<li>Helping key developers attend these sprints and other community events by
covering travel expenses to official Django events.</li>
<li>Providing financial assistance to community development and outreach
projects such as <a href="#django-girls">Django Girls</a>.</li>
<li>Providing financial assistance to individuals so they can attend major
conferences and events.</li>
<li>Funding the <a href="#fellowship-program">Django Fellowship program</a>,
which provides full­-time staff to perform community management tasks in the
Django community.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fellowship-program">Django Fellowship Program</h2>

<p>The biggest expense of the <abbr title="Django Software Foundation">DSF</abbr>
  is the Django Fellowship program. It's a project where
  <a href="#who-is-the-django-fellow">a paid contractor</a> is engaged to
  manage some of the administrative and community management tasks of the
  Django project to support rapid development of Django itself.</p>

<p><strong>The first year of the Django Fellowship program was very successful.</strong>
  The Django Fellow triages 10-15 new tickets each week and reviews and merges
  around fifteen non-trivial patches a week from community members and core
  developers. For the first time in Django's history, we had releases according
  to schedule (Django 1.8 and 1.9). You can read a retrospective on the things
  that were accomplished in <a href="/weblog/2015/jan/21/django-fellowship-retrospective/">
  the first three months of the program</a> as well as
  <a href="/weblog/2015/dec/17/fellowship-2015-retrospective/"> for the rest of
  2015</a> on our blog.</p>

<p>The program has a major positive impact on how Django is developed and
   maintained. Release blocking and severe bugs are not postponed indefinitely.
   The Django Fellow is a resource to help review patches and contributions
   from the community, and the community loves that:</p>

   
   <blockquote>
     <p>As a long time contributor to Django, I’m extremely happy to see how the fellowship empowered all contributors and leveraged their work. The development of Django was stunningly smooth, fast and efficient during the last three months. 1.8 alpha was released on schedule, which was unheard of until then. 1.8 is shaping up to be a great release.</p>

<p>Fellows guided the first steps of novice contributors — who may have seen their initiatives ignored otherwise. They took patches through as many review rounds as needed, relentlessly teaching Django’s guidelines and principles — where a hurried core developer may have simply made whatever changes they wanted, committed and moved on. They provided feedback on patches written by experienced contributors or core developers — allowing quick merges without shunting the review process.</p>

<p>I’m especially grateful to Tim Graham who reviewed within a day every pull request I submitted for my multiple template engines project. Without his constant help, I couldn’t have made the deadline for 1.8 without jeopardizing quality.</p>

<p>Thanks to the faster turnaround on reviews, not only did the fellowship program solve most pain points of Django’s contribution process, but it also increased quality. I hope we can resume it shortly and make it sustainable!</p>

<p><strong>If you use Django on a daily basis and care about the development of Django
   itself, you should donate today</strong> (may be <a href="/foundation/donate/#tax-deductible">tax deductible</a>).
   Only with your support can we make sure that the Web framework you base your work on
   can grow to be even better in the coming years.</p>

<h2 id="django-girls">Django Girls Outreach</h2>

<p>Supporting <a href="https://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls workshops</a> is
a significant priority for the Django Software Foundation. Django Girls
workshops are organized by volunteers and are provided as free events for women
who want to learn to code. The workshop serves as an introduction to Python and
Django, where attendees learn usable skills to build their first web app.</p>

<p>Django Girls workshop attendees go on to organize their own workshops, lead
in their community, and secure full­-time jobs as developers. Read their stories
in the “Your Django Story” series on the <a href="http://blog.djangogirls.org/">
Django Girls blog</a>.

</p><p>In 2015, the Django Software Foundation contributed $5,400 to eighteen
Django Girls workshops around the world. Here's what some of the organizers had
to say about the impact:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sponsorship from the DSF allowed us to have on-site child care for our Django
Girls Portland workshop. We hosted 2 young children and an infant, and provided
them with healthy snacks, games, sidewalk chalk, finger paint, and emoji
stickers. Without our nanny, 3 of our attendees wouldn't have been able to come
to the workshop. Finger paint photo is

<em>Lacey - Portland, Oregon, US</em>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The DSF supported <a href="https://djangogirls.org/warsaw/">Django Girls
Poland</a> four times this year and the impact was enormous! In Poland, diversity
awareness is not a very common topic. When we approached different local
companies about our workshops they usually didn't get what we were actually
doing and why it is important. If not for the DSF, we probably would not have
been able to hold our workshops at all. Our first workshops were the only until
now workshops that were 100% female - female only coaches and female only
attendees. Thanks to you, we were able to focus on gathering female mentors
instead of searching for sponsors!</p>
<em>Ania - Wrocław, Poland</em>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.kr/2015/10/django-girls-seoul-great-success.html">
Django Girls Seoul</a> had 425 applicants from 11 different countries ages
ranging from 16 to 50 years old. After acceptances, we had about 105 people to
feed and caffeinate! Thanks to Django's sponsorship we could get all of our
participants coffee for the day. It really made a huge difference because we
all know how a cup of coffee can change the atmosphere and mood! We were so
grateful to the sponsorship we received from abroad. We tried to get sponsorship
from a lot of Korean companies but the same generosity doesn't translate well
into a Korean Business culture, I guess. This made us even more thankful for
our friends at the DSF!</p>

        <h2>What is the Django Software Foundation?</h2>
        <p>Development of Django is supported by an independent foundation
          established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Like most open-source foundations,
          the goal of the <a href="/foundation/">Django Software Foundation</a>
          is to promote, support, and advance the Django Web framework. If you're
          interested in how the Django Software Foundation supports the Django
          Web framework, we published a

        <h2 id="who-is-the-django-fellow">Who is the Django Fellow?</h2>
        <p><strong>Tim Graham</strong> - a member of the core team for several years. For
        the 12 months before the fellowship began, he was a major contributor,
        reviewing and merging pull requests. Tim was contracted as a full-time
        Fellow for the duration of the 3 month pilot and continued when the
        program was renewed in March 2015.</p>
