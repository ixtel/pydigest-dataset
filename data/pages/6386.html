  <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> defaults to implicitly opening a new transaction on your first
database query. If you prefer to start your transactions explicitly instead,
I’ve documented here my explorations in getting that to work.</p>
<p>There are several different layers at play, so let’s review from the top:</p>
<section id="transactions-in-postgresql">
<h2>Transactions in PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>Since version 7.4, PostgreSQL itself always operates in “autocommit” mode. This
means that if you haven’t started a transaction, and you run a query that
changes data, it takes effect immediately; there is no need to commit it, and
no option to roll it back.</p>
<p>If you want to group several queries together into an atomic unit of work, such
that you can commit them all together or roll them back all together, you first
issue a <code>BEGIN</code> statement, then your queries, and then either a <code>COMMIT</code> or
<code>ROLLBACK</code> statement.</p>
</section>
<section id="transactions-in-pep-249">
<h2>Transactions in <span class="caps">PEP</span> 249</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/"><span class="caps">PEP</span> 249</a> specifies a common <span class="caps">API</span> for all Python database adapter libraries,
making it easier to write cross-database-compatible code. Almost all the
popular Python database adapters are (or claim or try to be) <span class="caps">PEP</span> 249 compliant.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">PEP</span> 249 <span class="caps">API</span> specifies a different behavior, which I will call “implicit
transactions.” There isn’t even a way to explicitly start a transaction in the
<span class="caps">PEP</span> 249 <span class="caps">API</span>; no <code>begin()</code> or similar. Instead, you are always in a
transaction; one is automatically started the first time you send a query to
the database after opening a connection, and the first time you send a new
query after ending the previous transaction with a rollback or commit.</p>
<p>Because Postgres doesn’t offer this behavior natively, the Postgres Python
adapters (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/">psycopg2</a>) have to emulate it themselves in order to be <span class="caps">PEP</span>
249 compliant. So by default, the first time you send a query to the database,
psycopg2 will prefix it with a <code>BEGIN</code> on your behalf.</p>
<p>In order to get psycopg2 to stop sending these automatic <code>BEGIN</code> statements
and to behave like Postgres natively does, you set the <a class="reference external" href="http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/connection.html#connection.autocommit">autocommit property</a>
of your connection object to <code>True</code>:</p>
<pre class="code python">
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">psycopg2</span>
<span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">psycopg2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'dbname=test'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre>
</section>
<section id="postgres-has-it-right">
<h2>Postgres has it right</h2>
<p>I prefer the ‘autocommit’ model. It’s simple, explicit, and
unsurprising. Queries are never grouped together into a transaction unless you
ask for one. If you issue a <code>COMMIT</code> or <code>ROLLBACK</code>, there is never any
doubt about which queries you are committing or rolling back, because you
explicitly issued the <code>BEGIN</code> to start the transaction.</p>
<p>I can see some advantage to the implicit-transaction model for
interactive-shell use (you can always roll back your changes if you screw
something up, even if you forgot to <code>BEGIN</code>), but for general use I think
it’s more error-prone. If you save a change to the database in one place but
forget to commit, that change will automatically be wrapped up in the same
transaction with later, possibly completely unrelated changes, and may get
blindly rolled back along with them. It wraps read-only <code>SELECT</code> statements
in useless transactions. And for long-running processes, since even a simple
<code>SELECT</code> implicitly opens a transaction (and you wouldn’t intuitively think
you’d need to commit or rollback after a <code>SELECT</code>), it’s very easy to
unintentionally end up with connections in the “idle in transaction” state,
where they are doing nothing but still may be holding locks and preventing
Postgres from compacting tables.</p>
<p>The explicit-transactions (autocommit) model lends itself naturally to Python
idioms like decorators or context managers for handling transactions. These
clearly wrap a section of code (a function, or the block introduced by the
<code>with</code> statement) as an atomic unit of work that will be committed or rolled
back together. It’s more difficult to correctly implement such an idiom in the
implicit-transactions model, because there is no explicit start point to a
transaction, so prior queries outside the demarcated block might get wrapped up
in the same transaction (or you have to check when entering the block whether
there are uncommitted queries in an existing transaction, and decide what
should be done with them — perhaps having to guess, or raise an error.)</p>

<section id="django">
<h2>Django</h2>
<p>Before we talk about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, let’s discuss the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> <span class="caps">ORM</span> briefly for
comparison purposes.</p>
<p>Up until Django 1.6, Django’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/transactions/#transactions-upgrading-from-1-5">transactions <span class="caps">API</span></a> used psycopg2 in its default
(<span class="caps">PEP</span> 249) mode, but then by default emulated a sort of Python-level
“autocommit” mode by automatically issuing commits after <span class="caps">ORM</span>-issued queries.</p>
<p>So in other words, if you were using Django pre-1.6 with Postgres, you had
psycopg2 emulating implicit-transactions on top of Postgres’ native autocommit
by automatically issuing <code>BEGIN</code> statements on your behalf, and then Django
emulating autocommit atop psycopg2’s emulated non-autocommit atop Postgres’
native autocommit, by also automatically issuing <code>COMMIT</code> statements on your behalf.</p>
<p>Got all that?</p>
<p>Thankfully, in Django 1.6 <a class="reference external" href="https://myks.org/en/">Aymeric Augustin</a> rewrote Django’s transaction
support (based in part on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Xof/xact">prior work by Christophe Pettus</a>) to use
database-level autocommit natively and only open transactions when explicitly
requested. The core <span class="caps">API</span> (really, the only <span class="caps">API</span>) is <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/db/transactions/#django.db.transaction.atomic">transactions.atomic</a>, which
can work as either a decorator or context manager to define an atomic unit of
database work (it can also be nested, using a stack of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-savepoint.html">savepoints</a> to achieve
the effect of nested transactions).</p>
</section>
<section id="sqlalchemy">
<h2>SQLAlchemy</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> follows the lead of <span class="caps">PEP</span> 249 and uses implicit-transactions as its
primary mode. Whenever you query the database, a transaction automatically
starts (SQLAlchemy doesn’t do anything special to make this happen, it’s just
using the database adapter — <code>psycopg2</code> in our case — in its default
<span class="caps">PEP</span>-249-compliant mode), and you can commit that transaction with
<code>session.commit()</code> or roll it back with <code>session.rollback()</code>.</p>
<p>Although I don’t prefer this mode, it’s a reasonable choice for SQLAlchemy to
rely on <span class="caps">PEP</span> 249 consistency across the board rather than implementing custom
code for native-autocommit mode in all its many supported databases.</p>
<p>But I’m using Postgres, I know how its native autocommit mode works, and that’s
the behavior I want with SQLAlchemy. Can I make that work?</p>
<section id="sqlalchemy-s-autocommit-mode-not-what-you-think">
<h3>SQLAlchemy’s autocommit mode — not what you think</h3>
<p>I soon found <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/session.html#autocommit-mode">autocommit mode</a> in SQLAlchemy’s documentation, and thought I
had my answer — but no such luck. SQLAlchemy’s autocommit mode is roughly
parallel to the “autocommit” in Django pre-1.6 (albeit smarter): it emulates
autocommit over top of non-autocommit database adapters by automatically
committing an implicit transaction after you send queries that change the
database. It doesn’t put the database connections into true autocommit mode, so
it still wraps reads in unnecessary transactions.</p>
</section>
<section id="turning-on-real-autocommit">
<h3>Turning on real autocommit</h3>
<p>Happily, setting all of SQLAlchemy’s psycopg2 connections into real autocommit
became quite easy in SQLAlchemy 0.8.2: SQLAlchemy’s psycopg2 “dialect” now
exposes an <code>AUTOCOMMIT</code> transaction isolation level, and selecting it sets
<code>autocommit=True</code> on all the psycopg2 connections.</p>
<pre class="code python">
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sqlalchemy</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">create_engine</span>
<span class="n">engine</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">create_engine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'postgresql://test'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">isolation_level</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"<span class="caps">AUTOCOMMIT</span>"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>We haven’t discussed transaction isolation levels yet (and I won’t in detail
here). They control the visibility of changes between multiple concurrent
transactions. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/transaction-iso.html">Postgres documentation</a> summarizes the options it provides.</p>
<p>It’s a bit odd that SQLAlchemy (<a class="reference external" href="http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/extensions.html#psycopg2.extensions.ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT">and psycopg2</a>) provide <code>AUTOCOMMIT</code> as a
transaction isolation level, since Postgres has no such isolation level, and
autocommit-mode isn’t really an isolation level at all. (In fact, if you choose
the <code>AUTOCOMMIT</code> “isolation level” in psycopg2, it turns on the connection’s
<code>autocommit</code> property but actually resets the real Postgres isolation level
to “read committed”, the default.)</p>
<p>But regardless, <code>isolation_level='AUTOCOMMIT'</code> is the incantation needed to
get all of our SQLAlchemy psycopg2 connections into true autocommit mode.</p>
</section>
<section id="starting-a-transaction">
<h3>Starting a transaction</h3>
<p>If we didn’t want to use transactions at all, this would be all we
need. SQLAlchemy would happily hum along thinking it has a transaction but
actually not having one at all (just like it does for databases that don’t
support transactions).</p>
<p>But we do want to use transactions, so we need a way to start one. The natural
<span class="caps">API</span> for this already exists in SQLAlchemy: <code>session.begin()</code>. Since
SQLAlchemy assumes that its database adapter will automatically start
transactions, <code>session.begin()</code> never actually issues a <code>BEGIN</code> to the
database. But we don’t actually need to issue <code>BEGIN</code> ourselves either - we
just need to turn off the <code>autocommit</code> property on our connection, and then
<code>psycopg2</code> will issue the <code>BEGIN</code> for us.</p>
<p>SQLAlchemy gives us a way to hook into the <code>begin()</code> call: the
<code>after_begin</code> event, which sends along the relevant database connection. We
have to dig through a few layers of connection-wrapping to get down to the
actual psycopg2 connection object, but that’s not hard:</p>

</pre>
<p>The <code>session.begin()</code> <span class="caps">API</span> can also be used to initiate “nested transactions”
using savepoints. In this case autocommit should already have been turned off
on the connection by the outer “real” transaction, so we don’t need to do
anything. We add in a couple asserts to validate our assumptions about what the
autocommit state should be in each case, and in the non-nested case we turn
autocommit off.</p>
<p>We also pass <code>autocommit=True</code> to the <code>Session</code>; this turns on SQLAlchemy’s
autocommit mode (mentioned above). This is necessary to prevent SQLAlchemy from
automatically starting a transaction (and thus triggering our <code>after_begin</code>
listener) on the first query.</p>
<p>This is the piece that I’m least happy with, as it means we have to worry about
what is meant by the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/session.html#autocommit-mode">vague warnings</a> in the documentation that Session
autocommit is a “legacy mode of usage” that “can in some cases lead to
concurrent connection checkouts” and that we should turn off the Session’s
autoflush and autoexpire features. So far I haven’t done the latter; waiting to
see what (if any) problems ensue in practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="back-to-autocommit-when-the-transaction-ends">
<h3>Back to autocommit when the transaction ends</h3>
<p>One thing remains lacking from our implementation. When a transaction ends, we
need to restore that connection to autocommit mode again.</p>
<p>This isn’t entirely straightforward. SQLAlchemy gives us three events
corresponding to the end of a transaction: <code>after_rollback</code>,
<code>after_commit</code>, and <code>after_transaction_end</code>. But these are all fired after
the connection has been “closed” (that is, returned to the connection pool),
and <code>after_transaction_end</code> is only fired once per SQLAlchemy
<code>SessionTransaction</code> object, which can involve multiple connections. For both
of these reasons, none of those events provide us with a connection object.</p>
<p>In order to get around this, I maintain a mapping of <code>SessionTransaction</code>
objects to the connection(s) that have had <code>autocommit</code> turned off due to
that transaction. Then I listen to <code>after_transaction_end</code> and restore
autocommit on all the appropriate connections:</p>

<p>It would be possible to implement this same context manager in SQLAlchemy’s
default implicit-transactions mode: you just leave out the call to
<code>session.begin()</code> in the non-nested case (because an implicit transaction
will already have been created). But that implementation then suffers from the
bug where database queries from prior to the context-managed block could be
included within its transaction. With some further cleverness you might be able
to figure out on entering the context manager whether the existing transaction
is already “dirty” (though this is not trivial to determine), and then either
raise an error or implicitly commit the existing transaction — but neither of
these solutions are appealing compared to the conceptual simplicity of
autocommit <span class="amp">&amp;</span> explicit transactions.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Is this all worth it? Perhaps not; it’s possible to work around the problems
with implicit transactions by being careful. And I’m not yet clear on the costs
of this approach — just how bad are the problems SQLAlchemy’s docs warn about
with its autocommit mode?</p>
<p>In any case, while I understand why SQLAlchemy is well-advised to generally
follow <span class="caps">PEP</span> 249 for its default behavior, I would love if it had
(scary-warning-free) support for an “autocommit and explicit transactions” mode
on those databases/adapters with good support for it.</p>
