<p>Python has an extremely rich and healthy ecosystem of data science tools. Unfortunately, to outsiders this ecosystem can look like a jungle (cue snake joke). In this blog post I will provide a step-by-step guide to venturing into this PyData jungle.</p>
<p>What's wrong with the many lists of PyData packages out there already you might ask? I think that providing too many options can easily overwhelm someone who is just getting started. So instead, I will keep a very narrow scope and focus on the 10% of tools that allow you to do 90% of the work. After you mastered these essentials you can browse the long lists of PyData packages to decide which to try next. </p>
<p>The upside is that the few tools I will introduce already allow you to do most things a data scientist does in his day-to-day (i.e. data i/o, data munging, and data analysis). </p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>It has happened quite a few times that people came up to me and said "I heard Python is amazing for data science so I wanted to start learning it but spent two days installing Python and all the other modules!". It's quite reasonable to think that you have to install Python if you want to use it but indeed, installing the full PyData stack manually when you don't know which tools you actually need is quite an undertaking. So I strongly recommend against doing that.</p>
<p>Fortunately for you, the fine folks at <a href="http://continuum.io/">Continuum</a> have created the <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda Python distribution</a> that installs most of the PyData stack for you, and the modules it doesn't provide out of the box can easily be installed via a GUI. The distribution is also available for all major platforms so save yourself the two days and just use that!</p>
<h2 id="ipython-notebook">IPython Notebook</h2>
<p>After Python is installed, most people start by launching it. Again, very reasonable but unfortunately dead wrong. I don't know a single SciPythonista that uses the Python command shell directly (YMMV). Instead, IPython, and specifically the IPython Notebook are incredibly powerful Python shells that are used ubiquitously in PyData. I strongly recommend you directly start using the IPython Notebook (IPyNB) and don't bother with anything else, you won't regret it. In brief, the IPyNB is a Python shell that you access via your web browser. It allows you to mix code, text, and graphics (even interactive ones). This blog post was written in an IPyNB and it's rare to go find a talk at a Python conference that does not use the IPython Notebook. It comes preinstalled by Anaconda so you can just start using it. Here's an example of what it looks like:</p>
