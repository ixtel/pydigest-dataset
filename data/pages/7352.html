TrueVault is engineered to store mission critical and highly sensitive data from verticals like healthcare, aviation, banking and the Internet of Things. TrueVault is designed to take data from mobile health apps, wearable devices, and even genomic research so that our customers don’t need to spend their precious time worrying about security, performance, and scalability. More than just a database as a service, TrueVault’s proprietary technology allows us to secure our customers' data better than anyone else can (hint: think encryption and global scale slice distribution).</p><p><br/></p><p>Our mission is to provide the simplest, most secure way for apps and devices to store sensitive data. Simple and secure storage of people’s most personal and private information is a huge challenge. That's why we are looking for incredible people (like you perhaps?) to join us. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Who is TrueVault?</b></p><p>TrueVault is a Y Combinator graduated startup based in Silicon Valley. We have an incredible group of investors including Paul Buchheit, Mark Pincus, and Bill Tai who have invested more than $3 million dollars because they deeply believe in our mission. We are a group of engineers passionate about data security, API performance, and building products that developers like us love to use. We are looking for a handful of engineering MacGyvers to join our founding team. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Why join TrueVault?</b></p><p>At TrueVault, you will have the opportunity to work in arguably the biggest market opportunity of this coming decade, improve the collection, portability, and security of really critical data, and push the envelop of data portability forward. You’ll work on things that haven't been done before. Plus you’ll get to choose what you want to work on and develop products that your peers will rely on and love using. </p><p><br/></p><p>If you want to work at a place that values "getting things done" more than "working the startup hours," talk to us. If you take pride in what you do and care about the people who use the product, you’ll find people just like you here. If you want to open source and share what you’ve built with the world, at TrueVault you can.
