<p>For our January meetup, Gayathri Swaminathan will be presenting a friendly introduction to NumPy and Matplotlib, using Jupyter notebooks.  This is targeted at a novice level, but feel free to come with your more advanced questions, too! </p>
<p><span>Gayathri is a Data Engineer at ObjectRocket, who is also our food &amp; drink sponsor this month.  They are providing a "burger bar" (with vegetarian options!), which should be pretty awesome.  </span><span>ObjectRocket has optimized every aspect of the stack behind some of the most</span><span> popular databases (MongoDB and Redis), to bring you solutions with the most scalability, speed, and safety. You can provision an instance in seconds, grow automatically with ease, and feel confident with automatic backups.  Their operations team monitors your databases and their engineering team is available 24x7x365 whenever you need help.  Be sure to check them out!  <a href="http://objectrocket.com" class="linkified">http://objectrocket.com</a></span></p>
<p>We will be meeting at the great Atlassian meeting space, as usual.  Katrina Riehl will be MCing the meetup this evening, so if you have an announcement or if you'd like to give a lightning talk, please get in touch with her or leave a note here on the meetup.com site.</p>
