Saw this via Twitter:

</p><a href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders/pyvim">pyvim, a pure Python vim clone</a><p>, by Jonathan Slenders from Belgium.
</p><p>
It's new and experimental, so will not have a lot of features, and may have some bugs.
</p><p>
I tried it out briefly after installing it with:
</p><pre>pip install pyvim</pre><p>(That's all there is to it. It's location even got added to my PATH.)
</p><p>
Here is a screenshot of me editing a file in pyvim:

</p><p>
And here is a screenshot of running pyvim without specifying a filename, i.e. editing a new file (same image as the one at the top of this post, except that the one at the top links to the pyvim site on Github):

The really interesting thing about the editor being written in Python, is that, as they say, it may later be possible to script the editor in Python:
</p><p>
"Further, when the project develops, it should also become </p><b>possible to write extensions in Python</b><p>, and </p><b>use Python as a scripting language</b><p>. (</p><b>Instead of vimscript</b><p>, for instance.)"
</p><p>
Speaking of vim, if you are new to vim or vi (vim's predecessor), you may like to check out my </p><a href="http://dancingbison.com/writings/vi_quickstart.txt">vi quickstart tutorial</a><p>, first published in Linux For You magazine. I first wrote the tutorial at the request of some Windows sysadmin friends who were transitioning to Linux, and they told me that it helped them to come up to speed with vi quickly, for basic text editing tasks. I then sent it to Linux For You as an article proposal and they published it.
