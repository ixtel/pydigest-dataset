<html><body><div><p>loginform is a library for filling HTML login forms given the login url,
username &amp; password. Which form and fields to fill are inferred automatically.</p>
<div id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Usage is very simple and best illustrated with an example:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from loginform import fill_login_form
&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; url = "https://github.com/login"
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get(url)
&gt;&gt;&gt; fill_login_form(url, r.text, "john", "secret")
([('authenticity_token', 'FQgPiKd1waDL+pycPH8IGutirTnP69SiZgm0zXwn+VQ='),
  ('login', 'john'),
  ('password', 'secret')],
 u'https://github.com/session',
 'POST')
</pre>
<p>And it is possible to use it as a tool to quickly debug a login form:</p>
<pre>$ python -m loginform -u john -p secret https://github.com/login
url: https://github.com/session
method: POST
payload:
- authenticity_token: FQgPiKd1waDL+pycPH8IGutirTnP69SiZgm0zXwn+VQ=
- login: john
- password: secret
</pre>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>A collection of real-world samples is used to keep this library tested. Those
samples are managed as follows:</p>
<p>First, you select a site to try, find out its login url, and run the following
command to try loginform on it:</p>
<pre>$ python test_samples.py https://github.com/login
[
   "https://github.com/login",
   [
      [
         [
            "authenticity_token",
            "NsdVWGpzxKmn7zSJSOdgnDcLIzIdJlCTO754LiEv2W4="
         ],
         [
            "login",
            "USER"
         ],
         [
            "password",
            "PASS"
         ]
      ],
      "https://github.com/session",
      "POST"
   ]
]
</pre>
<p>From the output you can judge if it worked or not. If it worked, great. If it
didnâ€™t, you would hack <tt>loginform.py</tt> to make it work and then add the sample
with:</p>
<pre>$ python test_samples.py https://github.com/login -w github
</pre>
<p>Note that we gave the sample a name (<tt>github</tt> in this case).</p>
<p>To list all availabe samples use:</p>
<pre>$ python test_samples.py -l
</pre>
<p>To run all tests, install tox and run:</p>
<pre>$ tox
</pre>
