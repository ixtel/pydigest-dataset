  <p class="quote-text">Previously, we were in a massive Excel spreadsheet. You never knew if you were looking at the most up-to-date information. With Fieldbook we can make a change to the data in one place, and it automatically updates in all other views.”</p>

  <p class="quote-text">We had over 100 files with contacts languishing in them… Fieldbook has given us a central place to put stuff. It’s simple and easy.… It took my assistant two hours to get squared away — you’d spend two hours just paging through configuration screens in one of the big CRMs.”</p>

  <p class="quote-text">I began using Fieldbook over a year ago when I was president of an organization running 30 events a year. I had to track finances, marketing, vendors, and over 30 volunteers. I dumped all my lists into a Fieldbook project, and miraculously, I was organized. I am very picky about using digital tools. Fieldbook is simple so it truly enhances my productivity.”</p>
