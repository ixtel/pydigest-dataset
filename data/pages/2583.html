In </p><a href="http://www.ifweassume.com/2014/09/map-of-fm-radio-station-towers.html" target="_blank">part I</a><p> of this series of posts I made this neat looking map of all FM radio station transmitter coverage in the US:

</p><p>
This is basically a population density map of course, but the data is intriguing for many reasons and the subject matter of listening to the radio on road trips is full of nostalgia.
</p><p>
Once I started making this map I immediately knew that I had to do a few studies on this fascinating dataset! </p><b>My next goal was to start grouping the stations by genre information. </b><p>As a first example of this, I am looking at the ~1600 stations that the Nielsen company monitors (excluding AM and Canadian stations, so actually closer to 1200 stations). Here I'm matching/joining the FCC's transmission coverage data to the </p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Broadcast_Data_Systems" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nielsen BDS</a><p> stations using their call sign (e.g. KUOW). I then grouped the stations by genre/format, and used the Python Basemap package (</p><i>very</i><p> sloppily) to draw the geographies
</p><p>
Here's the first image in the set:
</p><p>
Your first reaction might be: is this just another population density map?
</p><p>
Answer: no. The Nielsen BDS stations listen to targeted music/programming in certain markets. They don't listen to </p><i>every</i><p> Adult Contemporary station throughout the US, only selected stations in key markets. How these markets are determined is beyond me, and probably a matter of trade secrets or voodoo, I'd suppose...
</p><p>
So what we have in these maps is more like the geographic regions where each radio format/genre is considered important, or are good predictors of sales/popularity.
</p><p>
All caveats aside, there are some very interesting trends in the geographies vs genre, which largely track racial and socioeconomic distributions.
</p><p>
Here's an album of all the images (direct link </p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/UvBPn" target="_blank">here</a><p> incase the widget isn't working well)

For my next post on the distribution of radio stations in the US, I'm working to compile a larger database of most every station with a known format. So far I'm aggregating tables from wikipedia, but if you have a line on a more complete list drop me a line! Then I'll be able to discuss the actual geography of musical tastes in the US.
</p><p>
The long term goal for this ongoing project is called </p><a href="https://github.com/jradavenport/RadioTrip" target="_blank">RadioTrip</a><p>, where users could get map </p><a href="http://www.yournavigation.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">directions </a><p>and radio suggestions along the way based on musical taste. If you want to help with this project, let me know or ping me on GitHub!
