<html><body><div><article class="markdown-body entry-content" itemprop="text"><p><strong>Flit</strong> is a simple way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI.</p>
<p>Say you're writing a module <code>foobar</code>—either as a single file <code>foobar.py</code>,
or as a directory—and you want to distribute it.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure that foobar's docstring starts with a one-line summary of what
the module is, and that it has a <code>__version__</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-python"><pre><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"""</span>An amazing sample package!<span class="pl-pds">"""</span></span>

<span class="pl-c1">__version__</span> <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>0.1<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>Create a file <code>flit.ini</code> next to the module. It should look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-ini"><pre><span class="pl-en">[metadata]</span>
<span class="pl-k">module</span>=foobar
<span class="pl-k">author</span>=Sir Robin
<span class="pl-k">author-email</span>=robin@camelot.uk
<span class="pl-k">home-page</span>=http://github.com/sirrobin/foobar

<span class="pl-c"># If you want command line scripts, this is how to declare them.</span>
<span class="pl-c"># If not, you can leave this section out completely.</span>
<span class="pl-en">[scripts]</span>
<span class="pl-c"># foobar:main means the script will do: from foobar import main; main()</span>
<span class="pl-k">foobar</span>=foobar:main</pre></div>
<p>You can use <code>flit init</code> to easily create a basic <code>flit.ini</code> file for your
package.</p>
<p>Besides the details shown above, there are other fields you can add—see the
<a href="http://flit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/flit_ini.html">flit.ini page</a>
of the docs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Install flit if you don't already have it:</p>
<pre>pip install flit
</pre>
</li>
<li><p>Run this command to upload your code to PyPI:</p>
<pre>flit wheel --upload
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If your package is not registered on PyPI yet, flit will try to register it for
you during the upload step.</p>
<p>To install a package locally for development, run:</p>
<pre>flit install [--symlink]
</pre>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Flit only creates packages in the new 'wheel' format. People using older
versions of pip (&lt;1.5) or easy_install will not be able to install them.
People may also want a traditional sdist for other reasons, such as Linux
distro packaging. I hope that these problems will diminsh over time.</p>
</div>
<p>Flit packages a single importable module or package at a time, using the import
name as the name on PyPI. All subpackages and data files within a package are
included automatically.</p>
<p>Flit requires Python 3, but you can use it to distribute modules for Python 2,
so long as they can be imported on Python 3.</p>
