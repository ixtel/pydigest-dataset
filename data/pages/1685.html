These courses are open to the public and are limited to 25 participants. Class time is split between instruction and hands-on programming exercises, with the instructor available to assist and guide participants through exercises. For more information, see the <a href="virtual-training-faqs">Virtual Training FAQs</a>.</p><h4>On-Site Courses</h4><p>On-site courses are optimal for 12 participants, but can accommodate up to 20; these are typically conducted at a customer’s place of business. Class time is split between instruction and hands-on programming exercises, with the instructor available to assist and guide participants through exercises. Course topics can be customized to the customer’s needs if arranged in advance. Additional curriculum development costs may apply for non-standard instruction. Customers provide the instruction space, food and beverage, a video projector, and computers for participants to work on the programming exercises.</p><p>Organizations that purchase on-site courses will receive 25% off any online course taken by their employees, for a period of one year after the classroom training date.</p><h3>Certification</h3><p>In the near future, Continuum will offer exam-based certification. All participants of current and future courses will be eligible to take these certification exams.</p><h3>Special Partnership</h3><p>Continuum maintains a partnership with with <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/teaching.html">David Beazley</a> to deliver the <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/chicago/practical.html">Practical Python Programming</a> course. This course is taught by the same highly qualified Continuum instructors who teach Continuum Academy courses.</p><p>This course, designed for professional software developers, scientists, and engineers, is a comprehensive introduction to the Python programming language, standard library, and Python programming techniques. Although the course assumes no prior experience with Python, the course is strongly focused on practical applications including scripting, data analysis, and systems administration.</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><p>Although no prior experience with Python is required, our Python courses assume that participants have prior experience with at least one other programming language (e.g., C/C++, Java, Matlab, Perl, etc.). Our courses are <em>not</em> programming courses for absolute beginners.</p><p>Participants should be somewhat familiar with basic concepts of programming such as variables, statements, control-flow, functions, arrays, data structures, and common programming operations (e.g., searching, sorting, etc.). In addition, participants should have an acquaintance with working with files, directories (folders), text editors, command-line shells, environment settings, internet connections, and other essential aspects of using a computer for software development.</p><p><a class="content-button content-button--blue content-button--small ctools-use-modal ctools-modal-modal-popup-medium contact-modal" href="/modal_forms/nojs/webform/347" role="button">Contact Training</a></p>  </div>
