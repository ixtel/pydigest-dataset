    <p>Our exciting and fast-moving industry is not always very kind to the people in it.</p>
    <p>We all know people who have suffered <strong>burnout, exhaustion, depression and worse,</strong> if we haven’t had our own wings burned by these flames.</p>
    <p>To complicate matters, most of the people in the industry are young men, a cohort not good at acknowledging their own problems, or understanding other people’s, and the least likely to seek help when they need it.</p>
    <p class="standout">Mental health <strong>is</strong> an issue in the industry, and people are reluctant to talk about it.</p>
    <h2>Wellbeing support at DjangoCon</h2>
    <p> Cardiff University’s <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/counselling/">Counselling, Health and Wellbeing</a> service will be at DjangoCon, from Tuesday to Thursday. </p>
    <p>Trained counsellors will be available for anyone who wants to talk to someone, <strong>privately</strong> and in <strong>complete confidence</strong>.</p>
    <p class="standout">Booking a slot will simply be a matter of taking a Post-It note with a time on it from the appointments board, anonymously and discreetly.</p>
    <p>The counsellor will help you identify practical solutions to improve your wellbeing. </p>
    <p>A 25-minute session won’t solve all your problems, of course, but if there’s something in your life or work that causes you distress, this might be a first step to finding a way to deal with it. </p>
    <h2>Django for everyone’s benefit</h2>
    <p>The Counselling, Health and Wellbeing service is very generously providing staff time at no charge. In return, we have offered to help put the power of our community at their disposal. </p>
    <p>If there’s one thing Djangonauts are very good at, it’s collaborating to build web applications rapidly. We hope that some of our attendees would like to work together during the sprints, and with staff from the service, to build a useful open-source Django application to support their work.</p>
    <p>We’ve had a couple of suggestions: a better <em>online booking system</em>, or a <em>personal well-being tracker</em> to record states of mind and feelings; these are just some first ideas we had - if you’re interested, you’ll have a chance to explore this further at the event.</p>
    <p>We’re extremely grateful to the staff at the Counselling, Health and Wellbeing service for their support and their openness to our proposal, and hope that this represents a memorable example of the Django community’s ability to help itself and others through the things it does best.</p>
