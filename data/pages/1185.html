      <p>For those that haven't heard of the <a href="https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/" rel="nofollow">Myo</a> before - it's an armband that reads the electrical impulses from your muscles, letting you control devices by simply waving or gesturing with your hand.</p><p>If you <em>have</em> seen it and want to <a href="https://developer.thalmic.com/" rel="nofollow">develop</a> on it, you'll soon come to realize that the library is C++ only. This is great for code bases that are already in C++ (*cough* video games *cough*), but not if you just want to make a quick script that does something with the input data. So, why not use Python?</p><p>We created a small library for the supported systems (currently OSX, Win32 and Win64) that bundles all of the required C++ code into a separate process and exposes it via a simple python class. In later steps we'll also go over the protocol, so you can port it to a language of your choice!</p><p>Let's get started.</p><p><strong>Like this Instructable?
