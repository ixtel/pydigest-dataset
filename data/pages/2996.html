<html><body><div><div><p>A survey on the topic got conducted last year by <a href="http://strombrg.blogspot.com/">Dan Stromberg</a>.
<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/2.x-vs-3.x-survey">Here</a> are the results (<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/2.x-vs-3.x-survey?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=2013-2014+Python+2.x-3.x+survey.pdf">direct

People called for a yearly reconduction, here it is for 2014.</p>
<p>There were 6746 respondents, up from 4790 last year.</p>
<p>One can play with the dataset <a href="https://www.statwing.com/open/datasets/c52709b8ae94e6814b4aa23f6b8b12bc8acb0958">on Statwing</a>.

is an automatic quick recap. This report will focus on year-to-year evolutions.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall the transition is still going, with a 10 points increase in people
writing primarily python 3.x code. It still does not beat python 2.x on
personal projects.</p>
<h3>Have you ever written code in Python 2.x?</h3>
<p><img alt="nearly everyone" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/written_python2.png"/></p>
<h3>Have you ever written code in Python 3.x?</h3>
<p><img alt="+15 points, now more than 75%" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/written_python3.png"/></p>
<p><em>This</em> is great! At that rate by 2017 everybody will have written some python
3...</p>
<h3>Do you currently write more code in Python 2.x or Python 3.x?</h3>
<p><img alt="1/3 of python 3" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/more_python2_or_python3.png"/></p>
<p>+10 points is great. It if were linear it'd mean we're only halfway through but
I'd rather think we're close to a tipping point.</p>
<h3>When starting a personal project, which Python version do you use?</h3>
<p><img alt="close win for python 2" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/personal_choice.png"/></p>
<p>Python 2 is still winning, maybe for the last year?</p>
<h3>Which Python versions do you regularly use?</h3>
<p><img alt="2.7 and 3.4, duh" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/versions.png"/></p>
<p>I feel for the ones stuck on 2.5. Hey look, 3 is a real language for sure: it
is accumulating bagage, with nearly 200 respondents regularly using python 3.2!</p>
<h3>Do you think Python 3.x was a mistake?</h3>
<p><img alt="nope" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/python3_mistake.png"/></p>
<p>The evolution here is a bit hard to explain, for the new option "No, but a
more gradual transition would have been better" has probably taken votes from
both "Yes" and "No".</p>
<h3>Have you ever ported code from Python 2.x to Python 3.x?</h3>
<p><img alt="nearly 40%, small increase" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/ported_2_to_3.png"/></p>
<p>I was expecting a bigger increase, given the greenification of the <a href="https://python3wos.appspot.com/">Wall of
Superpowers</a>. Does that mean it's (globally)
always the same ones who port the code?</p>
<h3>Have you ever written/ported code using 2to3?</h3>
<p><img alt="nope" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/used_2to3.png"/></p>
<h3>Have you ever written/ported code using 3to2?</h3>
<p><img alt="noone" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/used_3to2.png"/></p>
<h3>Have you ever written/ported code to run on Python 2.x and Python 3.x unmodified?</h3>
<p><img alt="30%, stable" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/polyglot.png"/></p>
<p>I was expecting this figure to be higher. Sound like apart big libraries, few
are those who bother with that path.</p>
<h3>If applicable, what keeps you from leaving python 2 for python 3?</h3>
<p><img alt="dependencies is #1" src="http://blog.frite-camembert.net/images/python-survey/blocking.png"/></p>
<p>Other responses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>distro still based on python 2 (RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, OS X): 44</li>
<li>unicode: 30 (both "I don't like it in py3" and "we handle it poorly with</li>
<li>Google App Engine only supports python 2: 25</li>
<li>hating on print(): 23
python 3, transition causes too many problems" meanings)</li>
<li>lazyness: 13 (I believe it in the sense of "I am lazy", not "map &amp; co. being
lazy")</li>
<li>performance: 11</li>
</ul>
<p>This is it! Until next year.
Feel free to note any question that's is missing in your opinion.</p></div>
