<h6 id="the-spread-of-infection-as-a-gif-even-the-finns-will-succumb">The spread of infection as a gif. Even the Finns will succumb.</h6>

<p>Inspired by Jason at <a href="http://jasmcole.com/2014/10/19&#10;/going-viral/">Almost Looks Like Work</a> I wanted to take on some modeling of disease spread. Note that
this model has no claim what so ever on reflecting reality and is not to be
mistaken for the horrible epidemic in West Africa. On the contrary, it’s more to
be viewed as some sort of fictional zombie outbreak. That said, let’s get down
to it!</p>



<p>This is what’s called a <a href="">SIR model</a> where the letters S, I and R reflects
different states an individual can have in a zombie outbreak:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$S$ for susceptible. Number of healthy individuals that potentially could
turn.</li>
  <li>$U$ for infected. Number of <em>walkers</em>.</li>
  <li>$R$ for removed. Number of individuals that’s out of the game by separation
of head from body (if I know my zombie movies correctly), or that survived. But
there’s no cure of “zombie:ism”, so let’s not fool ourselves (it might be the
case thou if the SIR model is used for flu epidemics).</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have $\beta$ and $\gamma$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\beta$ is how transmittable the disease is. One bite is all it takes!</li>
  <li>$\gamma$ is how fast you go from zombie to dead. Has to be some sort of
average of how fast our zombie hunters is working… Well it’s not a perfect
model. Bare with me.</li>
</ul>

<p>So $S’ = -\beta I S$ tells us how fast people are turning into zombies. $S’$
being the time derivative.</p>

<p>$I’ = \beta I S - \gamma I$ tells us how the infected increases and how fast the
zombie workers are putting zombies in the <em>removed</em> state (pun intended).</p>

<p>$R’ = \gamma I$ just picks up the $\gamma I$ term that was negative in the
previous equation.</p>

<p>The above model does not take into account that there must be spatial
distribution of S/I/R. So let’s fix that!</p>

<p>One approach is to divide Sweden and the Nordic countries into a grid where
every cell can infect the nearby. This can be described as follows:</p>



<p>Where for example  being one cell and , ,
 and  being the surrounding cells (let’s not make our
brains tired with the diagonal cells, we need our brain for not getting our
brain eaten).</p>

<p>Initializing some stuff.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
import math
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt    
%matplotlib inline
from matplotlib import rcParams
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
rcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'
rcParams['font.size'] = 16
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 12, 8
from PIL import Image
</code></pre>

<p>Some appropriate beta and gamma making sure to wipe out most of the country.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">beta = 0.010
gamma = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Remember the definition of a derivative? With some rearranging it can actually
be used to approximate  the next step of the function when the derivative is
known and $\Delta t$ is assumed to be small. And we have already stated $u’(t)$.</p>





<p>Remember from before</p>



<p>And let’s call $u\left( {t + \Delta t } \right)$ which is the function $u$ in
the next time step for $u_{n+1}$, and $u(t) = u_n$ which is the current time
step.</p>



<p>This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">the Euler method</a>.
Let’s write it in code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def euler_step(u, f, dt):
    return u + dt * f(u)
</code></pre>

<p>We also need $f(u)$ in code. This uses some nifty array operations by the
goodness of numpy. I just might get back to that in another blog post, because
they’re great and might need some more explaining. But for now this will do.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def f(u):
    S = u[0]
    I = u[1]
    R = u[2]
    
    new = np.array([-beta*(S[1:-1, 1:-1]*I[1:-1, 1:-1] + \
                            S[0:-2, 1:-1]*I[0:-2, 1:-1] + \
                            S[2:, 1:-1]*I[2:, 1:-1] + \
                            S[1:-1, 0:-2]*I[1:-1, 0:-2] + \
                            S[1:-1, 2:]*I[1:-1, 2:]),
                     beta*(S[1:-1, 1:-1]*I[1:-1, 1:-1] + \
                            S[0:-2, 1:-1]*I[0:-2, 1:-1] + \
                            S[2:, 1:-1]*I[2:, 1:-1] + \
                            S[1:-1, 0:-2]*I[1:-1, 0:-2] + \
                            S[1:-1, 2:]*I[1:-1, 2:]) - gamma*I[1:-1, 1:-1],
                     gamma*I[1:-1, 1:-1]
                    ])
    
    padding = np.zeros_like(u)
    padding[:,1:-1,1:-1] = new
    padding[0][padding[0] &lt; 0] = 0
    padding[0][padding[0] &gt; 255] = 255
    padding[1][padding[1] &lt; 0] = 0
    padding[1][padding[1] &gt; 255] = 255
    padding[2][padding[2] &lt; 0] = 0
    padding[2][padding[2] &gt; 255] = 255
    
    return padding
</code></pre>

<p>Here I import an map with the population density of the Nordic countries and
downsample it to make the solving time resonably fast.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from PIL import Image
img = Image.open('popdens2.png')
img = img.resize((img.size[0]/2,img.size[1]/2)) 
img = 255 - np.asarray(img)
imgplot = plt.imshow(img)
imgplot.set_interpolation('nearest')
</code></pre>

<h6 id="population-density-in-the-nordic-countries-denmark-is-missing">Population density in the Nordic countries (Denmark is missing)</h6>

<p>Our $S$ matrix, the susceptible individuals should be something like the
population density. The infected $I$ is for now just zeros. But let’s put a
patient zero somewhere in Stockholm.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">S_0 = img[:,:,1]
I_0 = np.zeros_like(S_0)
I_0[309,170] = 1 # patient zero
</code></pre>

<p>Nobodys dead, yet. So lets put $R$ to zeroes too.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">R_0 = np.zeros_like(S_0)
</code></pre>

<p>Now set some initial values of how long the simulation is to be run and so on.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">T = 900                         # final time
dt = 1                          # time increment
N = int(T/dt) + 1               # number of time-steps
t = np.linspace(0.0, T, N)      # time discretization

# initialize the array containing the solution for each time-step
u = np.empty((N, 3, S_0.shape[0], S_0.shape[1]))
u[0][0] = S_0
u[0][1] = I_0
u[0][2] = R_0
</code></pre>

<p>We need to make a custom colormap so that the infected matrix can be overlayed
on the map.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import matplotlib.cm as cm
theCM = cm.get_cmap("Reds")
theCM._init()
alphas = np.abs(np.linspace(0, 1, theCM.N))
theCM._lut[:-3,-1] = alphas
</code></pre>

<p>And we sit back and enjoy…</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">for n in range(N-1):
    u[n+1] = euler_step(u[n], f, dt)
</code></pre>

<p>Not let’s render some images and make a gif of it. Everybody loves gifs!</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from images2gif import writeGif

keyFrames = []
frames = 60.0

for i in range(0, N-1, int(N/frames)):
    imgplot = plt.imshow(img, vmin=0, vmax=255)
    imgplot.set_interpolation("nearest")
    imgplot = plt.imshow(u[i][1], vmin=0, cmap=theCM)
    imgplot.set_interpolation("nearest")
    filename = "outbreak" + str(i) + ".png"
    plt.savefig(filename)
    keyFrames.append(filename)
  
images = [Image.open(fn) for fn in keyFrames]
gifFilename = "outbreak.gif"
writeGif(gifFilename, images, duration=0.3)
plt.clf()
</code></pre>

<p>Look at that! The only safe place seem to be in the northern parts where it’s
not so densly populated. Even Finland will at the end of the animation be
infected. Now you know.</p>
