<p>I am using an Android app to stream accelerometer data to a python script on my PC, which is then written to a text file. I am then attempting to use Javascript and jQuery to animate a 3d CSS cuboid (in the shape of a device) to mimic how the device moved when streaming the data. </p>

<p>At first I tried this using the gyroscope data, which is outputted in radians/s. I converted this to degrees/s by multiplying the value by 57 (one radian in degs) or so, but when I tried to <code>rotateX: 100deg</code> for instance this resulted in erratic behaviour when using these values to animate.</p>

<p>I would like to know how I can animate a 3d CSS object using data gathered from my android device's accelerometer, or whether this is possible at all? </p>
