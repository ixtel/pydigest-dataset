<p>The  HSV model is represented by a solid cylinder having the radius $1$, and height 1. $H$ is the hue, $S$, saturation, and $V$ represents  the brightness.</p>
<p>Sectioning this cylinder with a plane perpendicular to its vertical axis, at the height  $V=v$, one gets a color wheel whose complex parameterization is
 $z=Se^{2\pi i H}$.</p>
<p>As hue $h$ varies from 0 to 1, the corresponding colors vary in this color wheel such that  at $2\pi h$, with $h\in\{0, 1/6, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 5/6, 1\}$ are located respectively the colors  red,  yellow,  green, cyan, blue,  magenta, and red again (see the next image).</p>
<p>Saturation represents  the purity of  colors. For $S=1$ all colors are pure (do not contain white). As $S$ decreases the colors look more fade.</p>
<p>The brightness increases from zero to 1. At $V=0$, all colours look dark.</p>
