<p>Here is way of learning to create a website using the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> web framework without having to install
anything on your local computer.</p>
<p>This might be useful if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>you are intimidated by all the hurdles you need just to get to the beginning
of the tutorial.</li>
<li>you can't install things on your own computer.</li>
<li>or you want to be able to carry on with the learning from a different
computer, without copying your progress or installing things on the other
computer.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">I'm assuming you already know how to program in Python, or are sufficiently
experienced with programming that you don't mind learning Python while
learning Django at the same time. If not, have a look at these starting
points:</p>
<p>If you don't know much about programming, try <a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a>.</p>
<p>If you are experienced with other programming languages, but not Python, try,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.diveintopython.net/">Dive Into Python</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">I'm assuming you are reasonably comfortable with typing things into a command
prompt or terminal. Thankfully, even if you are not, you'll be doing
everything in a virtual machine somewhere on the internet, so you can't break
anything!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="steps">
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://code.runnable.com/">http://code.runnable.com/</a> and sign up for an account.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a new project, choosing ‘Django’.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You'll be presented with an almost empty Django project, complete with a
terminal. You can browse and edit files, and types commands at the terminal,
and press the big green 'Run' button to run your site and view pages
in another tab.</p>
<p>However, we first want to remove some things so that we can follow the Django
tutorial exactly.</p>
<p>In the terminal, type the following commands and hit enter. First, delete all
the files created in <tt class="docutils literal">/var/www</tt>:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
rm -rf /var/www/*
</pre>
<p>Next, we need to upgrade Django, because runnable.com installed an old version:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block">
pip install --upgrade Django
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now, open up the Django docs and start the tutorial, from part 1:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adjustments">
<h2>Adjustments</h2>
<p>Because you are running on runnable.com, rather than your own computer, you'll
need to make some very slight adjustments to the instructions at certain
places:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Ignore the comment about not putting files in <tt class="docutils literal">/var/www</tt> — while it should
be followed in general, it will make it hard for you to edit files on
code.runnable.com if you put them outside <tt class="docutils literal">/var/www</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">After you have run <tt class="docutils literal">startproject</tt> in the tutorial, you will need to find the
<tt class="docutils literal">settings.py</tt> file and make an adjustment. Find the block that defines
<tt class="docutils literal">MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES</tt> and remove the line:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="literal string single">'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware'</span><span class="punctuation">,</span>
</pre>
<p>This middleware is an important security feature, but it interferes with the
way that runnable.com displays your project in a frame (in its normal
workflow), and without this change you will be presented with a blank page
after you press 'Run'.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When it comes to running the your Django project, the easiest way is if you
use the green 'Run' button, but adjust the command. Click on the gear icon to
configure it, and change the command to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd /var/www/mysite; python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
</pre>
<p>Now press the 'Run' button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it! You should be able to complete the tutorial with these adjustments.</p>
