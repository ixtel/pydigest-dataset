          <p>Thanks to everyone for stepping up.</p>

<p>I've added all three volunteers as collaborators on this project. I've also added Marc and Alex as maintainers on the PyPI service so they can make releases. <a href="https://github.com/ubaniak" class="user-mention">@ubaniak</a> what is your username on PyPI?</p>

<p>I should now note that the current release process as lightly documented in release.py uses 'jaraco.packaging', which assumes Mercurial is the SCM tool. I imagine most everybody will be using a native git client instead. One of the first tasks in taking ownership of this project will be transitioning that release process to something that supports a native git client.</p>

<p>Right now the release process is automated, handling the tagging, test confirmation, changelog confirmation, building, and releasing of the project. I'd recommend keeping some process to support that. I'd even support extending jaraco.packaging to support git, though I wouldn't recommend it.</p>

<p>In any case, I'll happily work with anyone to help with the transition, so don't hesitate to ask.</p>
