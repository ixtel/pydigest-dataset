<p>My favourite tweeter is <a href="https://twitter.com/pickover" target="_blank">Clifford A. Pickover</a>. His tweets are delightful nuggets of math, physics &amp; more. I have a copy of his fascinating <a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/physics-book.html" target="_blank">The Physics Book</a>. However, in <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?q=44899+pickover" target="_blank">these tweets</a>, he claims that the string <strong>44899 <em>first</em> occurs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" target="_blank">pi</a> at position 44899</strong>, counting from the first digit after the decimal point. I thought it might be interesting to check this, and to see if there are any more such ‘self-references’ in say, the first 100,000,000 digits of pi. There’s obviously 1 at position 1, which mathematicians would probably call ‘trivial’.</p>
<p>So my first task, is to find a way to compute pi to far more than the accuracy of math.pi in Python. A quick search of the web sent me to Nick Craig-Wood’s <a href="http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/pi-chudnovsky/" target="_blank">pages</a> on computing pi in Python using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm" target="_blank">Chudnovsky algorithm</a>. There I found <a class="reference external" href="http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/pub/pymath/pi_chudnovsky_bs_gmpy.py">pi_chudnovsky_bs_gmpy.py</a>. It needs the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2" target="_blank">gmpy2</a> library. I needed to <a href="http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/pi-chudnovsky/#comment-1286653137" target="_blank">change a line</a>: <em>sqrtC = (10005*one_squared).sqrt()</em>  (line 63) to <em>sqrtC = gmpy2.isqrt(10005*one_squared).</em></p>
<div id="attachment_362" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://xkcd.com/386/"><img class="wp-image-362 size-medium" src="//i0.wp.com/python3.codes/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/duty_calls.png?resize=273%2C300" alt="XKCD: Duty Calls" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/python3.codes/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/duty_calls.png?resize=273%2C300 273w, http://i0.wp.com/python3.codes/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/duty_calls.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">XKCD: Duty Calls</p></div>
<p>I then wrote the following quick and dirty script, which probably isn’t as efficient or as beautiful as it could be – but it got the job done! The <em>len(str(digits))-1</em> bit adds a few digits to allow for the length of the string being searched for. In the first 100,000,000 digits of pi, the numbers <strong>1, 16470, 44899, 79873884</strong> are the only ones which occur at the positions they index. I didn’t do any timing, but it only took a few minutes! When I first wrote this, I overlooked the word <em>first</em> in the claim; so then I added <em>pistr.find(istr)</em> to check where the found number first occurred. Only <strong>1</strong> satisfies the requirements. The program’s output is:</p>
<pre>Computing Pi
Searching for Pickover numbers
1  first occurs at  1
16470  first occurs at  1602
44899  first occurs at  13714
79873884  first occurs at  46267046
</pre>
<p>As a ball-park check on this, go to <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~huberty/math5337/groupe/digits.html" target="_blank">100,000 digits of Pi</a> and use your browser’s find function to locate 44899. This number is slightly under one half of 100,000, but there’s a couple of occurrences of it well before halfway. Or better yet, go to <a href="http://www.angio.net/pi/" target="_blank">The Pi-Search Page</a>. I’ve replied to Pickover’s tweet and emailed him to let him know the claim isn’t correct. He is <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/" target="_blank">wrong on the Internet</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: He kindly responded to my email, and agrees that the claim as worded is wrong.</p>
