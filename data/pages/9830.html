I almost had myself convinced that it was a no-brainer. But then I graphed the NEXUS and non-NEXUS groups over the stretch of all the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">years</strong> in the dataset and got the following result:</p><figure name="5a76" id="5a76" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"/><figure name="3002" id="3002" class="graf--figure graf-after--figure"/><p name="6c62" id="6c62" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">In 2015, the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">gap</strong> between the wait times of the two groups <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">closed</strong> significantly. Of the fourteen days from 2016 included in the data (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">which is misleading and could’ve been omitted</em>), it appears that the trend is continuing.</p><p name="e172" id="e172" class="graf--p graf-after--p">I have a theory behind this: For every person that gains access to a perceived advantage, the advantage becomes less advantageous. You can imagine that if handicap parking passes were administered to every person who’s been to the hospital in the last 10 years, the advantages of having such a parking pass would diminish.</p><blockquote name="927c" id="927c" class="graf--blockquote graf--hasDropCapModel graf-after--p">For every person that gains access to a perceived advantage, that advantage becomes less advantageous</blockquote><p name="1281" id="1281" class="graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Anecdotally, I heard stories in 2015 where the NEXUS line was actually longer then the non-NEXUS lines. It seems that NEXUS could soon reach a tipping point where so many people are members that the benefits no longer outweigh the associated costs.</p><p name="9bad" id="9bad" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Will I renew my membership when it expires in 2017?

In other words, if we have enough rows of xs that relate to ys, can we figure out how much <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">weight </em>each x is worth in predicting future values of y? Visually, it might looks like this for my project:</p><figure name="c57c" id="c57c" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"/><p name="c3ad" id="c3ad" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Given 750,000 rows of data, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how much </em>of the independent value (Wait time in minutes) could be explained by our dependent values?</p><h4 name="45ed" id="45ed" class="graf--h4 graf-after--p">Results</h4><p name="df17" id="df17" class="graf--p graf-after--h4">In addition to the source data, I added three more sources to my data (links are in GitHub):</p><ul class="postList"><li name="a225" id="a225" class="graf--li graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Daily</em> weather data from the Government of Canada</li><li name="0747" id="0747" class="graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Daily </em>exchange rate data (CDN:USD) from the Bank of Canada (Canadians are famous for shopping across the border when our dollar is doing well)</li><li name="70b0" id="70b0" class="graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Weekly </em>American gas price data from USEIA (Unfortunately I couldn’t find any open data that would allow me to compare the prices between say BC and Washington)</li></ul><p name="0762" id="0762" class="graf--p graf-after--li">This data is all pretty <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">coarsely</em>-grained compared to the fine-grained border data that came in 5-minute intervals. Thus, I didn’t expect them to help our model <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">too</em> much.</p><p name="e9c0" id="e9c0" class="graf--p graf-after--p">I measured the performance of my model by finding its coefficients of determination aka its R-squared value. This is a fancy way of determining how close our model’s 700,000+ predictions compared to the actual known values from the original data.</p><figure name="aaa1" id="aaa1" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><figcaption class="imageCaption">My features</figcaption></figure><p name="d15c" id="d15c" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Using the pictured features and dummy values for day of year and hour of day, I was able to get an R-squared value of .49. A perfect score of 1 would mean that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">all</strong> of the variation in our dependent variable could be explained by our independent values. A score of zero would mean that the Y value had absolutely no relation to the X values.</p><p name="e6a7" id="e6a7" class="graf--p graf-after--p">My model’s sitting right at the middle, meaning that I was able to account for approximately half of the variation in the Wait Time column. This makes sense as there could be thousands of other variables affecting how long the line-up is at the border. The model actually did slightly better at predicting Volume (.57) than Wait Time, which makes sense because there’s no guarantee that government agencies will respond perfectly to the number of vehicles in line</p><p name="638c" id="638c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">So could you use my model to predict how long border waits are going to be in the future? No. Again, this was my first time trying out machine learning on real data and at no point did I expect to create an accurate model. Linear regression is one of hundreds of machine learning algorithms that could've been applied here and I chose it simply because it’s the only one I’ve learned so far.</p><p name="bea3" id="bea3" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Technical note: The biggest flaw with my model was that because of its linear-ness, it was predicting a lot of negative values for waiting times. I couldn’t figure out how to communicate to the model that time can’t be negative. Anybody who knows about machine learning is probably cringing but if you know how to fix this, please let me know! I suspect it could be solved by taking the log of the dependent value or by just not using linear regression.</em></p><h3 name="43a0" id="43a0" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Closing</h3><p name="58e4" id="58e4" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">As always, thanks for reading!
