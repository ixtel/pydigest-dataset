					<p>Greetings all,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The classic question of which language to used, to implement a game idea I had.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First, some introduction to my background of course. I have hard science background, my job involve maths model and probability. I used R extensively and some C# on my day job. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two years ago, I tried to write game in Objective-C, X-code in a Mac (I bought that Mac just for this !). I manage to get the spaceship sprite moving,  wave of small fighters hovering around the mother ship, shooting lasers into enemy ships. The spaceship leave trails when moving across, explode with particle effect when killed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The game didn't make it . </p>
<p>Extremely buggy, no end game objective, not much 'game' there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, I rewrite another game, again using X-code. This time a turn based, tiled base game, much like X-com. I can move the character, command it to shoot, it hit/miss, effect sprung in.. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Didn't make it either. </p>
<p>I ran out of steam. It's just like X-com, except on smaller tile. I got a demanding job and work late hour, I am only doing the coding after work. And it was very, very, tired now I looked back at it. I would sleep at 1-2am sometimes trying to figure out the algorithm to get the angle of view right.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So many years of coding, I am not good at testing my codes. I don't even know how to properly use a version control. Right now, that Mac is sitting in the drawer for months and the Xcode is too old in version and can't even run. I am not a Mac user, I sit more comfortable with Windows...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, this time, I felt different. I had a trading game idea earlier and I wrote it down in a design document. Instead of doing any coding, I did none this time and instead focus on putting the game idea down, clearly. Every couple of days/week I would revisit the document and add/modified some thing. That is still not it, recently, a golden bulb struck me and I had this Blacksmith game idea. My creative juice was flowing so fast that within 1 week, I did a very long and detailed Game Design document and had all the game/objective/control and fun factor all thought out.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I felt this could be it. After much failure (and knowing that I got not much spare time), I felt I could never be the game programmer I wanted to be. And I plan to sub the program job to other more experience guys. They could code my game. I also understand that a game idea need several rounds of iterations and tuning before it could finally be fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, my question is, which program best suits my need ?  I need to iterate quickly, use least amount of time possible. The main objective is to test my game idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I only have bare basic experiences with Java and Python. </p>
<p>Python is interpreter language like R, so it might suit me? I don't mind the slow performance, as i only plan to use it for pro typing, testing my game idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All thoughts are welcome. Thanks !</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PS: I learnt objective-C / Xcode from zero knowledge to getting a partial game done. That was the passion I had back then, it burnt out painfully.</p>
