                            The jam.py is an object-oriented, event-driven framework with hierarchical structure.
                            All this, in combination with very tight DB/GUI coupling, is the bases for the DRY (don't
                            repeat yourself) principle that is underlying the framework. So just several hundred lines
                            of code is enough to create quite complex database applications (See Demo application).
