<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>PyCon(s) carry a benevolent motive of helping the Python community worldwide by providing extensive knowledge resources. I started following PyCon conferences from 2013. My first learning experience from PyCon tutorials &amp; workshops inspired me to follow it back in the year 2014 and this craze continued in 2015 as well.</p>
<p>You can check out the training recommendation for tutorials of Pycon 2014 <a href="http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/04/training-recommendation-tutorials-pycon-2014-usa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Watching these PyCon videos has been an immense learning for me and I am glad that I could spare time to go through them. The event is divided in 2 parts: Tutorials (Workshops) or talks. Workshops aim to provide 3 hour hands on sessions where the instructor also acts as a facilitator. In this article, I have compiled a list of workshop videos you should watch from PyCon 2015.</p>
<p>To remove the confusion (because there are quite a few talks on data science here), I have made a recommended roadmap. This roadmap is a sequence of tutorials &amp; workshop held at PyCon 2015 watched in a structure.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h3/>
<h3>List of Workshops at PyCon 2015</h3>
<p>Below is the roadmap of the workshops held at PyCon 2015. We recommend beginners to watch these videos in the listed sequence to help understand these concepts better, intermediates &amp; experts can watch these videos as per their ease.</p>

<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hands-on-data-analysis.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15471" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hands-on-data-analysis.png?resize=501%2C300" alt="data analysis, Python" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hands-on-data-analysis.png?resize=300%2C180 300w, http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Hands-on-data-analysis.png?w=755 755w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>Good place to start learning data science in Python! Watch Sara explain these concepts in very simple manner. This video will be helpful for anyone wanting to perform data analysis in Python.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IPython-and-Jupiter-in-depth.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15475" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IPython-and-Jupiter-in-depth.png?resize=489%2C300" alt="Ipython, Jupyter, Python" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IPython-and-Jupiter-in-depth.png?resize=300%2C184 300w, http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IPython-and-Jupiter-in-depth.png?w=776 776w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>I personally use IPython notebooks for the interactive data exploration and recommend it to every data science professional. In case you are wondering what are Python notebooks? this video is just the right place to start. It provides a super basic introduction of notebooks in Python, which then moves on to the explanation of super developed notebooks for Python such as iPython and Jupyter.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pandas-from-the-ground-up.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-15481" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pandas-from-the-ground-up.png?resize=457%2C300" alt="Use of pandas in Python" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pandas-from-the-ground-up.png?resize=300%2C197 300w, http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pandas-from-the-ground-up.png?resize=670%2C440 670w, http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pandas-from-the-ground-up.png?resize=258%2C169 258w, http://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pandas-from-the-ground-up.png?w=701 701w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px" data-recalc-dims="1"/></a></p>
<p>Data Science in Python couldn’t have been effective without Pandas. This video will help you to understand Pandas by performing various exercises as practiced by the instructor. He emphasises more on learning while solving exercises. Apart from that, you will get to know about various functions in panda that you might have missed out till now.</p>

<h3>End Notes</h3>
<p>In this article, we covered the list of data science related workshops held at PyCon Montreal 2015. We also defined a roadmap to help beginners learn python one step at a time. I believe these are fantastic resources for hands on learning and developing data science skills.</p>
<p>If you face any difficulties while learning Python, feel free to ask us <a href="http://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com" target="_blank">here</a>. In the next article, we’ll bring up the list of most useful talks related to Data Science in PyCon 2015.</p>
