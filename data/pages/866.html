<p>
While working at the </p><b>command-line</b><p>, I came up with the idea for this little Python utility which displays a </p><b>ruler on the console</b><p>. You can use this program's output as a ruler, to find the character positions and lengths of parts of your own program's output on the line, or to </p><b>measure the lengths of fields</b><p> in </p><b>fixed-length or variable-length records</b><p> in a </p><b>text file or CSV</b><p> file which you need to process via your program. And of course, your program can be in any language, not just Python.
</p><p>
Note: the program is written assuming a </p><b>console width of 80 characters</b><p>. You can change some of the values in it if you need it to work with a console of a different width.
</p><p>
I've called it </p><b>ruler.py</b><p>. Here is the code for it:
</p><pre>"""
# ruler.py - A program to display a ruler on the command line.
Copyright 2014 Vasudev Ram - http://www.dancingbison.com
Program to display a line on the command-line screen.
The line consists of repeated occurrences of the characters:
0123456789, concatenated.
Purpose: By running this program, you can use its output as a ruler,
to find the position of your own program's output on the line, or to 
measure the lengths of fields in fixed- or variable-length records in a text file,  
fields in CSV files, etc.
"""

import sys

def ruler(units="0123456789", repeats=8, fives=True):
    for i in range(repeats):
        if i 
And here is its output:
<pre>$ python ruler.py
0    5    1    5    2    5    3    5    4    5    5    5    6    5    7    5
01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
$</pre>And the output from this call to ruler():
<pre>ruler(repeats=8, fives=False)
</pre><pre>0         1         2         3         4         5         6         7
01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
</pre>I've parameterized the values it uses, to some extent, so you can customize them. You can also import the file ruler.py as a module and call its ruler() function in your own Python program. The code for doing that is as simple as:
<pre># test_ruler.py

from ruler import ruler

ruler()
</pre>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler">Wikipedia article on rulers</a>
 is interesting.
