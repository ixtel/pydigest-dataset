After reading the License Agreement, drag the tomviz icon into your Applications directory – or anywhere else you would like to store the application.

This is only required the first time launching the application. It can be opened by double clicking all future times. <strong>Linux</strong>: Currently, the Linux application must be built from source, instructions for building can be found in the BUILDING.md document found in the source code archive.</p>
