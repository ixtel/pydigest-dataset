"It’s a new year, and that means it’s time for another attempt to get WSGI 2.0 off the ground. Many of you may remember that we attempted to do this last year with Rob Collins leading the charge, but unfortunately personal commitments made it impossible for Rob to keep pushing that attempt forward. Since then, the need for a revision of WSGI has become even more apparent. Casual discussion on the web has indicated that application developers are uncomfortable with the limitations of WSGI. These limitations are providing an incentive for both application developers and server developers to take an end-run around WSGI in an attempt to get a framework that is more suitable for the modern web. A great example of the result of WSGI’s deficiencies is Andrew Godwin’s channels work for Django, which represents a paradigm shift in application development that takes it far away from what WSGI is today.",https://mail.python.org/pipermail/web-sig/2016-January/005357.html,Discussion - What do you believe WSGI 2.0 should and should not do?

"A while back, Dropbox released a very smart password validation library called zxcvbn (check the bottom left row of your keyboard) which measures strength as “entropy,” rather than as a function of adherence to a particular set of rules. Running zxcvbn on the backend eliminates the dictionary size problem, but introduces a new one: You want to be able to preserve back-end field validation but still provide real-time feedback in the client. I’ve put together a kit for Django that satisfies both goals (yes there are other Django implementations for zxcvbn but none of them worked quite how I wanted).",http://birdhouse.org/blog/2015/06/16/sane-password-strength-validation-for-django-with-zxcvbn/,Sane Password Strength Validation for Django with zxcvbn | scot hacker's foobar blog

Monkey patching has its uses well beyond just patching bugs though.

Another not some common case of monkey patching is to add instrumentation to existing Python code in order to add performance monitoring capabilities.,http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2015/03/safely-applying-monkey-patches-in-python.html,Safely applying monkey patches in Python.
