Since then, the need for a revision of WSGI has become even more apparent. Casual discussion on the web has indicated that application developers are uncomfortable with the limitations of WSGI. These limitations are providing an incentive for both application developers and server developers to take an end-run around WSGI in an attempt to get a framework that is more suitable for the modern web. A great example of the result of WSGI’s deficiencies is Andrew Godwin’s channels work for Django, which represents a paradigm shift in application development that takes it far away from what WSGI is today.",Discussion - What do you believe WSGI 2.0 should and should not do?

I don't have the mathematical skills of Wiles, so all I can do is write a program to search for counterexamples. I first wrote that program in 2000, and my name got associated with Beal's Conjecture, which means I get a lot of emails with purported proofs or counterexamples (many asking how they can collect their prize money). So far, all the emails have been wrong.
